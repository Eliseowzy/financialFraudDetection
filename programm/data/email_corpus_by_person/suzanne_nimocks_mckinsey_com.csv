Arkin CC BCC FROM Carol B White Pru Sheppard EU EPNG RI DATE December Power sector restructuring international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been privatized A second tranche should take place in A pool mechanism should be operating by Consortia of industrials using more GWhyear can contract directly with IPPs by the threshold will be GWh year The potential free market currently amounts to TWh a year or of total demand This will increase to in ENEL who has a de facto monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent system can currently supply eligible customers who consume more than GWhyear at a single site The countrys four discos may purchase up to of consumption outside the public system Portugals regulator ERSE needs either to extend the eligible customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to reach the percents required by the Directive The government sold another stake of of stateowned Electricidade de Portugal in October following two successful offerings in and This offering raised billion The state retains and golden share voting rights Rui de Sousa Spain After several major Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint ownership In the generation market the incumbents share continues to decline National Power and PowerGen have divested further capacity and now stand at and The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations have not yet been written The government is working with the IMF to set up financial controls and eliminate crosssubsidies Between and all generation will be upgraded or privatized Transmission will remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant Temelin which should begin operating by spring CEZ plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by after the commercial launch of Temelin Kristina Kalinova White Hungary Since December majority shares have been sold in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western investors Eastern Europes earliest and most ambitious privatization program has fallen victim to a host of problems especially central government price control AES and IVOTomen tendered new capacity tendered in but AES is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign its agreedon PPA Hungary will partially deregulate its market after but before it joins the EU Further privatization opportunities include a coalfired power plant as well as the monopoly transco MVM Cs Ilkei White Moldova The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of Modova giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution companies then in three generators The first attempt to privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids All companies will require substantial investment for upgrades White Romania In September the national electric company Conel was split into four independent units These encompass fossil generation hydro generation transmission and distribution and metering Restructuring precedes eventual privatization which will begin with distribution followed by generation Current law requires foreign owners to have a local partner As Romania is one of the countries invited to join accession talks with the EU it is opening its market in stages Currently GWh has choice this will rise to GWh next year Evenually elegibility thresholds will be lowered to GWh then GWh Cs IlkeiWhite Russia In the mids the Unified Energy Systems of Russia Joint Stock Company UES also known as RAO was organized into regional joint stock companies UES still holds shares in most of these regional utilities In May President Putin fired the nonreformist energy minister who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and liberalization The new minister is an unknown quantity The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls currently at White Slovak Republic In October the government approved a plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy sector implementation legislation needs to be passed The plan would see stateowned Slovenske Elektrarne the GTD monopoly transformed into a stateowned joint stock company Regional distributors will be separated from SE and merged in the first half of into three jointstock companies with a block of shares to be sold Generation will also be separated and transformed into joint stock companies Municipalities will acquire majority stakes in the heating plants The government will select a privatization adviser for SE and for the distribution companies in early Kristina Kalinova Turkey The controversy over BOO buildownoperate vs BOT buildoperatetransfer arrangements for IPPs was resolved in January Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability Recent MA activity has seen already privatized Victorian distribution retail and transmission change hands with new owners coming from Asia ElectraNet South Australias SA transco was sold as a year lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged NGCTransAlta will be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand with a market cap of NZbillion and more than customers Pakistan Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated PPAs which allow fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone the October sale of the three gencos two of the three prequalified companies failed to submit final bids Also the political opposition has challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme Court Panama Privatization of governmentheld IRHE is now complete of distribution and generation was sold in The government plans to retain control of transmission Foreign investors are involved in building some generation The big news is the Central American integrated grid which should join Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua Costa Rica and Panama into a single market by The IADB is running project Peru The new Energy Minister Chamot favors restarting the privatization program stalled since September SOUs mentioned for privatization were six regional energy companies as well as a MW Andean hydro complex Mantaro It was not clear what form privatization would take nor is it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and fled Peru also announced bids for construction and operation of two transmission lines Currently only large industrials representing of the market have choice There are no plans to expand this Trinidad and Tobago While there has been a partial unbundling of the generation arm of TTEC the government utility retains control of TD as well as of all of natural gas purchases There been neither much IPP nor privatization activity since the sale of of TTEC to Southern and BP Amoco in and the financing of one IPP in Venezuela The Chavez government imposed an electricity restructuring law in August Industrials can choose their supplier but there are no plans to open the market completely A wholesale market is proposed for Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere due to high subsidization While the government dithered on privatization plans AES jumped in with a surprise bid for the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas The government recently announced a tentative sale date of early for of two regional electric companies Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys

created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet

for internal purposes Would you find it helpful to be on the distribution list Hope you are doing well Look forward to touching base soon Forwarded by Suzanne NimocksHOUNorthAmericaMCKINSEY on AM Memorandum TO Pru Sheppard BCC Suzanne Nimocks FROM Pru Sheppard B Venki Venkateshwara DATE March California Power Crisis Update No DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK The weeks highlights include Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn Jeff Gerths story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multiyear investigation of Bill Clinton The key issues are familiar Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps refunds and so on If so what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than cents on the dollar The California ISO filed a complaint claiming billion in overcharges this week The QF irony Through the s QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market In recent months in California they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output But credit problems have created an ironical situation The facts PGE and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PGE and Edison into bankruptcy Some gasfired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas Last weeks court decision allows MidAmericanCalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility CalEnergy does so immediately selling to El Paso The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO when requested regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO Reliant announced it will appeal the order This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the situations are probably different The QF contracts predate the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies In fact many QF contracts have the opposite provision authority for the utility to cut takes during socalled light load periods Stage emergency and rolling blackoutsagain There was another Stage emergency in California with rolling blackouts this week This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March Among the factors Increased demand from summerlike temperatures Cutbacks in imports Loss of MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant Loss of about MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits An internal memorandum laid out two choices The agency could audit and punish bad actors the companies that were exploiting the market Or it could identify bad hours when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobodys fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors the memorandum said The commission took the easier way It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few bad hours in January and February That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during good hours when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme The order ignored those hours Today in a criticism of the agencys lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies But the agencys track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely softpedaled its role as the electricity industrys top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials The agencys defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely handsoff approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say Californias rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits The agencys critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by freemarket passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was insufficient data in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies Yet his own former employer PGE Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the midAtlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics The agencys inaction the critics say leads to gaming jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track Were trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers Mr Hebert said Fight Over Deregulation Todays debate traces back to the s when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years Two Republican seats are currently unfilled The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late s after the agency had begun opening the gas markets By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the midAtlantic states Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market But the agencys balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AYbear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions Mr Hebert said high prices in California were sending the right signals to get supply there Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging unlawful and said that his agency by not reining them in is simply not doing its job The agencys leadership has been in flux for months Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports Though Mr Heberts positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically freemarket position of any commissioner He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces When Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies debt Mr Heberts response was dismissive Its not in the interest of the American public he pronounced Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks The midAtlantic region experienced some early volatility As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called market power the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the midAtlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate The decision roiled some agency officials Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring LocalFederal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much The industry not surprisingly shares that view One vocal critic was Mr Miller Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energytrading unit of PGE Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during Californias crisis Mr Millers former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide PGE Energy Trading by several estimates is now the secondlargest seller of electricity in New England The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PGE and other companies Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged very high prices when it could One persons predatory pricing is another persons competitive advantage Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in New England regulators too often acted as judge jury and executioner when overseeing the market he said One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New Englands problems from the regulators perspective Their Nov report attributed New Englands frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws As Mr Millers team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agencys began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New Englands ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said They said the department was examining whether PGE and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year PGE confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the departments requests Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PGE or at the agency His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PGE and his duties at the agency Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agencys San Francisco office One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show Daniel Larcamp Mr Millers supervisor said there might have been more information that could have been obtained in the California inquiry But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so timeconsuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PGE The lawyers said Mr Millers participation had been permissible because PGE was not the subject of the investigation When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market But while the companies had the potential to exercise market power the commission said there was insufficient data to prove that they did Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices When the agencys own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a lastminute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a timeconsuming investigation During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal misbehavior by sellers bad actors always seems to fail his memorandum said It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours The suggestion won the day The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several privatesector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons Because most highpriced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as just and reasonable the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis The problem with my agency is that were so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that weve gotten sloppy Mr Massey said Were talking about electricity Its the juice of the economy so its got to be available and reasonably priced Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved TULSA Okla AP Williams Cos Inc says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold overpriced electricity to California Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co a unit of Tulsabased Williams owes California more than million in refunds for power it sold to the states Independent System Operator The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for million in overcharges from transactions in January and February The Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid claims the state was overcharged billion by wholesale power providers including Williams between May and February Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO According to the commission power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions However the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams power prices Collins said The commission will review Williams explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds Allegheny Energy makes big California connection Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved HAGERSTOWN Md AP Allegheny Energy Inc said Thursday it has agreed to sell billion worth of power to Californias electricitypurchasing agency over the next years The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to megawatts that the Hagerstownbased company has secured from western generating plants through its new energy trading division Allegheny Energy Global Markets formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets This is a winwin for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy It provides a longterm source of fixedprice energy and should help to stabilize prices in California said Michael P Morrell president of the Allegheny Energy Supply division Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power which delivers electric energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALT LAKE CITY AP The Williams Cos plans to expands its Kern River pipeline which runs through Utah to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California Williams gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line Construction on the billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May said Kirk Morgan director of business development for Kern River pipeline Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin where producers are aggressively stepping up production Morgan said The new pipeline is expected to deliver about million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah Nevada and California Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California If all of the pipelines capacity were used to generate electricity it could produce about megawatts That is enough to light around million homes Morgan said The original Kern River line was completed in It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield Calif It currently transports million cubic feet of natural gas per day Williams based in Tulsa Okla recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by million cubic feet per day That million pumping station project should be completed by July During the construction period the Kern River project will employ between and people The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from million to about million Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline Morgan said The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities including St George and Cedar City Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full capacity so this is an opportunity to transport additional gas into those areas from companyowned supplies in Wyoming said Questar Gas spokeswoman Audra Sorensen Calif Energy Commission OKs Pwr Plants Worth MW Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California Energy Commission Wednesday approved three power plants worth megawatts two of which are scheduled to come on line by the end of a CEC spokesman said Thursday The plants approved include BP Amoco PLC BP unit ARCO Western Energys megawatt Western Midway Sunset Project slated to come on line in October Caithness Energys MW Blythe Power Plant to come on line by Dec and Thermo Ecoteks MW Mountainview Power Plant scheduled to come on line in April All three of the new plants will be natural gasfired combinedcycle plants The million Mountainview plant will be located in Southern California near San Bernadino The million Western MidwaySunset plant will be located in central Kern County while the million Blythe plant will be located in the city of Blythe in Riverside County The latest approvals bring to the total number of plants approved since April by the CEC a spokesman said Those plants will supply MW to the state which has seen rolling blackouts and spiking wholesale power prices in the last six months in part due to lack of supply By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Some CalEnergy Power Could Be Sold Outside Calif CEO Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Some of CalEnergy Operating Corps power could end up being sold outside of California though that is not the companys intent CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday CalEnergy an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co which is majority owned by Warren Buffetts BerkshireHathaway BRKA was given legal authority Thursday to suspend megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling We stopped supplying power at PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since thenWe are selling it to marketers our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us Sokol said Sokol added that while it was his companys intention to have its power sold to California that could not be guaranteed We leave the energy selling to El PasoWeve directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we cant stop them from selling out of state Sokol said Wholesale prices on the open market are about a megawatthour three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed The courts ruling did not address the million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power and Sokol said that his companys separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utilitys assets as payment for that debt Sokol said the courts ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small independent generators known as qualifying facilities or QFs who have not received payment from SoCal Ed Edisons own lawyer said it bestthat every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market Sokol said Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadnt won the case but said he couldnt speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome A group of renewable power suppliers owed more than million from SoCal Ed said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability The utilities claim close to billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze In a statement SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergys bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergys request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors While many of the states large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California the QFs which make up onethird of the states total power supply havent been paid by SoCal Ed since November PGE has made partial payments to its QFs By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold contributed to this article California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO Californias balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison allowing it to sell power on the open market The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the states financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas Electric which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small alternative energy producerswhich together provide nearly a third of the states powerget paid But Assembly Republicans opposed it saying it hadnt been given sufficient scrutiny The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County where Edisons failure to pay CalEnergy the countys biggest property taxpayer had outsize implications CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a million property tax payment The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokols first acts after the judges ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time That is great news Leimgruber said Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market Some of the more than other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas Electric We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gasfired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a creditworthy company that in fact pays for the power An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because Californias power crisis has placed them in financial distress just as it has placed utilities in financial distress Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we cant stop them Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy million and that the companyalong with seven other small producershad been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy He said his company no longer intends to do so and he believedbut wasnt certainthat the other companies would shelve their plans Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed million to various small electricity producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam solar energy or wind The alternative energy producersand utilitiesstrenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday The bill spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the Senate on a vote the exact twothirds margin required But it stalled in the Assembly on a partyline vote well short of twothirds When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster said Thats exactly what we have before us The alternative electricity generators including oil companies warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal while representatives of Edison and PGE which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole There isnt enough money Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday It is a very simple question Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in The bill AB X combined several proposals First it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PGE must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying Additionally the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity Wind solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration But most of the alternative energy producers including Chevron and British Petroleum use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat With natural gas prices high they contend they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering Ellingwood reported from El Centro Morain from Sacramento Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at billion up from the billion first thought Californias power grid operator said Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that CalISOs figures dont take into account all their costs A Superior Court judges ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid Verbatim If these guys have such high costs how come theyre making so much money Gary Stern Edisons director of market monitoring and analysis referring to power producers Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Californias electricgrid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by billion or a total of in a month period and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets Meanwhile a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energystarved state but likely at greater cost to the state government The billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO says it isnt seeking a refund for the May through February period because its analysis lacked important market data For example it estimated costs for suppliers based on published prices for natural gas not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel We dont know how much gas actually was purchased at spotmarket prices said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs head of market analysis Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO said FERC needs to become more aggressive about marketpower mitigation The ISOs filing he said was intended to push the agency in that direction since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and naturalgas markets He said that if the FERC doesnt act the state of California may find ways to discipline the market such as through the state attorney generals office The attorney general has been investigating the states electricity market for many months but hasnt brought any court action Dynegy Inc a big owner of power plants in California said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable The Houston company was one of energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling million or show cause why it should be excused Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern Californias Imperial County A judge granted geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc of Omaha Neb permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co and instead seek other buyers These plants known as qualifying facilities are under longterm contract to Edison and other utilities but havent been paid for months Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the states failed utilityderegulation plan While the CalEnergy case involves only about megawatts of power the repercussions could be far greater Collectively hundreds of qualifying facilities or QFs produce as much as of Californias electricity needs QFs totaling megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market presumably to the state government that now is Californias biggest energy buyer An hour after the court decision yesterday some megawatts of power came back into the market the ISO said However additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the states tab Already the state has allocated more than billion for electricity purchases Separately Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a writeoff of as much as billion for Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis the company hasnt yet reported yearend earnings Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals regardless of size from rolling blackouts The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investorowned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than hospitals throughout the state Under PUC rules hospitals with more than beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies But during rolling blackouts Monday at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers Linda Ziegler director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them But hospitals say there is a second lapse before emergency generators kick in which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery You wouldnt fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place said Ann Mosher a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco Backup generators are just that theyre not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis from incidents like lightning or a knockeddown power pole If its a serious problem for the hospital its certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis she said The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the states investor owned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are separately regulated For more than two decades prisons hospitals with more than beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services and are exempted from blackouts by order of state power regulators After rolling blackouts began darkening the state in January many other public service groups began seeking relief from power interruptions including transit systems schools and water districts On the Net Federal Judge Orders Reliant To Keep Selling Pwr To Calif Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc SACRAMENTO Calif APA federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not get paid US District Judge Frank C Damrell Jr said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant Energy REI stopped selling power to the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power grid The ISO buys lastminute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply Damrell dismissed Reliants attempt to force the state Department of Water Resources to back the ISOs purchases for the states two biggest utilities The state has been spending about million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power Gov Gray Davis has said the state isnt responsible for purchasing the costly lastminute power ISO buys for Edison and PGE despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities behalf ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California Had the decision gone the other way one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders Robinson said Damrells preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter Damrell denied the ISOs request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers Dynegy Inc DYN AES Corp AES and Williams Cos WMB which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling Spokesmen for Reliant Dynegy AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didnt immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired The judge then issued a temporary restraining order requiring the sales but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling The ISO said it would lose about megawatts if the suppliers pulled out enough power for about million households One megawatt is enough for roughly homes Grid officials said Reliants share alone is about megawatts Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that because most of its output is already committed under longterm contracts Reliant which currently provides about of the states power worries it wont get paid due to the financial troubles of PGE and Edison PGE and Edison say that together they have lost about billion since June due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that Californias deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Many of Californias independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the states three investorowned utilities At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the states Public Utilities Code which links the socalled qualifying facilities electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas Lawmakers however are poised to pass the legislation State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric from a megawatthour to MWh regardless of the price of natural gas Whereas each of the QF contracts differed largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities The cogeneration facilities which produce about megawatts of electricity in the state said the rates are too low and they wont sign new supply contracts with the utilities For MWh natural gas would have to be per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border said Tom Lu executive director of Carsonbased Watson Cogeneration Company the states largest QF generating MW Our current gas price at the border is Other gasfired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week Lu whose company is halfowned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed million by SoCal Ed said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse David Fogarty spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association whose members supply California with more than MW said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than billion for electricity that was already produced State Loses MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about onethird or MW of the states total power supply Roughly MW are produced by natural gasfired facilities The rest is generated by wind solar power and biomass About MW of gasfired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners havent been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cashstrapped utilities SoCal Ed and PGE for nearly four months Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates The defaults have left many of the renewable and gasfired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they cant afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the states utilities but arent being paid even on a forward basis The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electricity grid said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday Gov Gray Davis recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of MWh and MWh for five and year contracts He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward After next week the QF problem will be behind us Davis said Tuesday We want to get the QFs paidthe QFs are dropping like fliesand when that happens the lights go out But this just makes the problem worse said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter a member of the Assembly energy committee I dont know how we are going to keep the lights on Florez said in an interview Many of these congenerators are in my district They said if the legislation doesnt change they are going offline This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts especially now when we need every megawatt Davis who didnt meet with people representing the QFs said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a fiveyear price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities In addition SOCal Ed opposed the legislation saying the rates should be below MWh Some renewable power producers said they arent vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities said his group of gasfired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said Hal Dittmer president of Sacramentobased Wellhead Electric in Sacramento which is owed million by PGE has MW of gasfired generation units offline Under the states plan Dittmer said he risks going out of business I cant buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision he said

MORAIN JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market After two days of statewide blackouts power plants that had been shut down were cranked up Unseasonable heat tapered off The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency But plenty of ominous signs remained Many small producers remained shut down skeptical about Gov Gray Davis plan for utilities to pay them State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the states foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only megawatts of electricity significantly less than the to megawatts previously claimed While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons including the states failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July The Legislature has approved plans to sell billion in bonds but none have yet been issued We are exposed

California was forced to start buying electricity in Decemberat a cost of million a daybecause producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators said the report represents a work in progress He said the state may yet sign new contracts However Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to realtime meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand The head of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs He said the state needs to take over the utilities contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business and sign new contracts for megawatts of new wind powerthe cheapest fastest and cleanest source of new supply Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers some of which have not been paid since November But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal sources But most of them generate power using natural gasand the cost of natural gas has been soaring Several natural gas users said Davis plan which caps rates wont cover their fuel costs Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall But small generators say they dont have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis proposal next week It offers producers two choices cents a kilowatthour if they agree to supply power for five years or cents a kilowatthour over years The price of natural gas is higher than that said Marty Quinn executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which

reviewing the decision and should have more to say in a day or two To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs a

costs to customers under a rate freeze Gov Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December Pacific Gas Electric Co has made some partial payments to QFs but SoCal Edison has paid nothing Together they owe the QFs about billion but the order doesnt address that debt An Edison executive said in reaction to the governors sharp comments that the company simply doesnt have the money to pay creditors The root problem here is there just isnt enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster We understand the financial distress the QFs face we are facing financial distress ourselves The proposed PUC order would also require the states investorowned utilities to offer the small generators five and year contracts for power for MWh and MWh respectively The QFs may be able to live with the PUC proposal but the five and year contract prices may be inadequate if natural

California for a second day Tuesday a key consultant to Gov Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the states largest utilities are proceeding at an accelerated pace Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days although those with PGE are much less advanced The administration and PGE have not reached even an agreement in principle he said PGE which has more debt than Edison says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart The state wants to buy the utilities transmission lines and other assets for about billion to provide cash to the utilities help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months To research the grid purchase Fichera said the state has had to pore over documents just to assess the utilities liabilities We are working at a good pace said Fichera chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners If we get to a dealbreaker it might be longer By making Fichera who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission available to reporters Tuesday the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governors plan to pull the state out of the crisis Since midJanuary when the big utilities credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them the state has spent nearly billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas Oklahoma Georgia and North Carolina Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the states electricity The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cashstrapped alternative suppliers including solar biomass and wind power units cut their normal supply to the system in half They say Edison and PGE have not paid them since November the utilities say they are out of cash Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost individual contractors Another delaying factor said Keeley who with state Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers prices was the huge enmity manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities These people just dont like each other This weeks blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration When it comes to electricity size doesnt matterevery kilowatt counts During peak use a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts There is no such thing as a partial solution Unless the whole energy equation is balanced the parts dont work For the Davis plan to work several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the already set in motion The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through longterm contracts with the big outofstate producers These contracts the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group The administration says it has concluded contracts with generators about half of which have been signed According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned billion bond offering to succeed The bonds set for sale in May will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity The state is currently spending at a rate of million a day to buy power If prices stay high the billion in bonds will not cover the states power purchases by the end of the summer Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment Angelides has estimated that under the January law that put the state in the power buying business the state must be reimbursed billion annually and that billion is needed to service the debt PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers known as qualifying facilities must be cut at least in half down from an average of more than cents per kilowatthour In his news conference Tuesday Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at cents for year contracts and cents for fiveyear contracts Meanwhile PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid Lynch said The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they havent been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation said John Nelson a spokesman for PGE The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves mainly from hydro and nuclear sources at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it This is tied to

emissions Critics renew call for full disclosure DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As part of his closeddoor negotiations to buy electricity Gov Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air Davis said Tuesday Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with generators to supply billion worth of power during the next years However the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms contending that release of such information would hamper the states ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity Sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc a power company based in Houston is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the companys deal with the state We couldnt get them to sign contracts it was a sticking point Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM Under the system companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution If their operations pollute more companies are required to purchase credits on an open market Currently the credits cost about per pound of pollutionan amount that can lead to a bill of well over million a year for a power plant The South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the systema step that could considerably cut the states potential cost Davis said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power companys costs It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power she said If it brings down the price of power I dont have a problem with it Nevertheless word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts the critics note The Legislature should have known about it said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco It is going to cost taxpayers money It makes you wonder This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature V John White a lobbyist for the Sierra Club who also represents alternative energy producers called the contract proposal a horrible precedent Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents we cant determine how serious the breach of principle this is White said Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations Terry Francke general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light In the summer when demand for power is highest some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts To avert blackouts state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running In such cases some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any finesalthough Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollutionrelated measures

said But I also have a corollary responsibility that I dont stick these generators with a higher rate FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Following a preliminary nonpublic investigation FERC directed AES Southland Inc and Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co IN on March to show cause why they did not violate section of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability mustrun RMR generator units during a period in April and May The investigation responded to a matter referred by the CalISO If a violation is found Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their marketbased rate authority for a year The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission The CalISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network The CalISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR units availability and a variable payment for the RMR units output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market Williams Energy and the CalISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the CalISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intrazonal congestion The ISO may dispatch a nonRMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available Under its RMR agreement with the ISO Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units However if a nonRMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable Williams will be paid its bid price not the RMR contract price During the April to May period the CalISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos and Huntington Beach as RMR units to provide voltage support However according to the FERC order Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos available from April through May and to make Huntington Beach available from May through May for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units Consequently the CalISO was forced to dispatch nonRMR units at a higher cost namely Williams Energys bid price for service provided by the replacement units By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energys variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units output Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May The bid price for the nonRMR units was at or near the CalISOs theneffective bid cap of MWh FERC continued Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the CalISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the nonRMR units approximately MWh during the period in question This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million The information in this order and a nonpublic appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons Based on this information coupled with Williams Energys financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the CalISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its marketbased rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the CalISOs tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue and whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations a refund by Williams Energy andor AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available and a condition on Williams Energys marketbased rate authority Specifically for a oneyear period if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the CalISO a nonRMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract In other words Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute non RMR unit The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the abovedescribed violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed Further to ensure procurement of all relevant information the Commission instituted a formal nonpublic investigation into the operation maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in and Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California consumers havent been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts consumers arent using less electricity which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid As a result blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities the ISO said ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option but consumers in the state arent heeding the call to reduce consumption Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan and Jan when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints Jim Detmers the ISOs vice president of operation said consumers saved the state about megawatts of electricity enough power for million houses The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about MW or less We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time Detmers said The states Energy Commission said consumers think its no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed People have been saving generally but it isnt a big bump from hour to hour a spokesman for the Energy Commission said Gov Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least of electricity compared with last summer The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Gas Cos Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs Though consumers get a share of the windfall regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus which is expected to be huge this year as a form of price relief The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co Through vigorous deal making the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down For several years the utility has been splitting the savings with ratepayers whenever the companys gas costs fall slightly below market levels Those savings Gas Co executives acknowledged have shot to unprecedented heights during the states power crisis Now in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices regulators are taking another look at the program The question before the Public Utilities Commission Should Gas Co ratepayers who endured huge bill increases this winter get a bigger share of the savings The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded million But the amount for the last months is expected to multiply many times over company executives said partly because the Gas Co has done so well in the wild market by selling lending and trading gas as well as buying it The recent market conditions could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers the PUCs consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates reported Oct even before the latest upward market spirals Gas Co representatives express frustration saying they have done what the state has requested under its gascost incentive program Buy smarter and pass the savings along to its million residential and smallbusiness customers The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost The PUC every time we do well raises the bar on us said Jim Harrigan director of gas acquisition I dont necessarily agree with it By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity the Gas Co has become a big player in the regional natural gas market In the companys bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters employees track price movements pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along Californias border where prices have rocketed The PUC created the cost incentive program for the states three major gas utilitiesSan Diego Gas Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co in Like Southern California Gas SDGE is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Cos trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings Californias gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers monthly gas bills but are not itemized At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed Theres no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the companys award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from belowmarket gas and transportation costs In the early years of the program records show the Gas Cos awards went from zero to million million million and million Last years award of million is awaiting PUC approval This years proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was wellequipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said Harrigan said however that he does not believe the companys level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this years incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June I dont want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the companys award I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers It has been immense Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities The companys gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet Thats more than twice last years cost but only about half what sister company SDGE paid for its customers in February Its also much lower than the per therm PGE pays We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needsabout to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier This presents opportunities At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border With gas price runups like those seen in the last year Pocta said there is a question Should that benefit be shared or flow entirely to ratepayers Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals By the same token we want the Gas Co to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added We want them to have incentives The question is how to balance them Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January The company makes gas sales at various locations It engages in exchanges It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division Before they were lots more riskaverse Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them Records show that the shared savings at SDGE a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gasfired electricitygenerating plants He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year In an annual report to the PUC in February PGE said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer advocacy group said it will closely watch the PUCs evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co We want to make sure given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said Well look to see whether the mechanism should be changed Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter longterm contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market Unfortunately under the system he said the only incentive is to beat the spot market Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section See attached file Dow Jones

Wednesday March Energy Insight Embedded image moved to file picpcx By Dave Todd US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising energy prices Delivering the keynote address at the US Chamber of Commerces national energy summit in Washington Monday Abraham said California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians Not very says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels managing director of Bostonbased METIS Trading Advisors Krapels a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities such as Consolidated Edison design markethedging programs adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the countrys economy in respect to energy security management First of all New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California he said California has hydro nuclear and gas but when it lost a lot of hydro the state needed gas to pick up the slack and the capacity just wasnt there In New Yorks case the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than Californias Krapels added New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning Californias marketplace New Yorks Independent System Operator ISO in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining instate generation capacity reserve margins and a strategy must be put in place whether or not new generation comes online in accordance with current anticipated scenarios A measure of New Yorks essential difficulty is that between and statewide demand for electricity grew MW while generating capacity expanded by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved the gap is expected to continue to widen To avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the states daily generating capacity needs to grow by MW by with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear the ISO wants to see a stateappointed ombudsman named to help wouldbe merchant power plant investors plow through red tape Increasing New Yorks generating capacity will also lessen the states escalating and risky reliance on outofstate sources of electricity the ISO added Since New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from instate sources Not everyone agrees with that analysis insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down interjurisdictional barriers In any case New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the US Northeast such as PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool are in vastly better shape in terms of crossborder cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market In California by contrast the states focusfor example in the case of new gasfired power plant developmenthas been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone rather than on a regional marketplace Embedded image moved to file picpcx The New York ISOs new broadbased analysis of marketrestructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New Yorks utilities to enter into longterm power contracts What needs to be done most it says is to move aggressively to build some of the more than MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline In the meantime the MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldnt be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early longrange weather forecasts Demand however is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to So while New York City the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year it could be a brief rest from the fray Meanwhile a shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan on Long Island and even on barges offshore One way or another whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities its going to be a hot time in the city Longterm solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile attempts at longerterm solutions continue to run into trouble Last week Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that HydroQuebec subsidiary TransEnergie US Ltd wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authoritys load pocket Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound the proposal failed to convince authorities who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut In similar fashion private companies wanting to build small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizationssome of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany The David vs Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good But suddenly in New York Californias troubleswhile still distant in their intensity may not be so far away By some estimates this summers bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last years charges Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isnt going to make the pain go away NEW YORK NYISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES NYISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NYISO said in a recent report Power Alert New Yorks Energy Crossroads New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NYISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report This report is essentially a caution light at New Yorks energy crossroads Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NYISOs warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline In a related development the NYISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NYISOs socalled temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse The NYISO Report The NYISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply The NYISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NYISO said this gap will continue to widen The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New Yorks power consumers The NYISOs modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs Besides large rate increases the NYISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on outofstate resources The report said that if no new instate generation comes on line in the next five years the states generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by Pointing to Californias situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities To avoid these harsh consequences the NYISO said New Yorks new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built The problem according to the NYISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made The NYISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gasfired units On a more positive note the NYISO reported that New Yorks restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter longterm power contracts The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial The report also recommended accelerating conservation realtime metering and pricesensitive load programs and upgrading the states and the Northeasts transmission infrastructure The Proposed Tariff Amendments New Yorks Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NYISOs request to extend from until its MWh bid caps FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them The NYISOs board is sensitive to the Commissions concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related Nevertheless the NYISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York states Article X process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth Moreover although the NYISO proposes to implement several demandside measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently priceresponsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demandside response Thus the NYISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NYISOs proposed demandside response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces Other problems cited in the NYISOs filing which keep New Yorks power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the states CentralEast interface and questions over adequate gas supply The NYISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued Nevertheless the NYISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJMs markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NYISOs bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets The NYISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high runups in prices The NYISOs request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through cited similar problems with New Yorks power markets but claimed that the NYISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws The TEPs were and remain an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NYISO and the Commission intended the filing insisted MASSACHUSETTS Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOSTON AP The states top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see Californiatype electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press Our major problem will come this summer State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California and on Monday California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in to attract more companies to stir competition But that hasnt happened yet largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition said Reilly a Democrat That competition in the wholesale market is not happening Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the regions power A spokeswoman for the regions power grid said electricity use is expected to rise to percent this year but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past months The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand said Ellen Foley spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc which manages the grid of generators connected by miles of high voltage transmission lines Still a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity a situation that arose once last summer Foley said In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation Those customers typically pay more than longterm customers Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into twoyear contracts with suppliers instead of the sixmonth contracts many have now to avoid shortterm price spikes for consumers Reilly said The Attorney Generals Office acts as an advocate for consumers Michael Monahan a spokesman for NSTAR which provides electricity to more than million customers is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod but currently has no lines under construction I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that its something we have to focus on Monahan said but he added The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity Californias statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero California partially deregulated its electric industry in two years

Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CARSON CITY Nev AP Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid Californiastyle energy problems The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure its constitutional said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend RReno And thats not as easy as it sounds Townsends comment just before his committee began working on SB was prophetic witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure Translation Dont kill all deals by stopping Renobased Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegasbased Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June and possibly until Pete Ernaut a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before a deal that would be in the publics interest If you put a twoyear moratorium on these plants all these deals are going to go away he said When the cow leaves the barn its difficult to catch Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB on Monday Now its up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee Reliant isnt the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive Earlier this month executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that its in the publics interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant The Harry Allen plant produces about megawatts out of the megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate Pinnacle has plans to expand that to megawatts by Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts dont have to be included in SB Townsend said Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills but the power plant sale issue must be handled now Nevadas PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies merger in under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the states electricity and if theyre sold the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from billion to billion by July if the power plant sales are stopped Nevadas Consumer Advocates Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of million in

Maine AP In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state Maines top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis A panel of industry insiders elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anticompetitive activities In addition the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maines deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity improve conservation and spur competition The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state Maines deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls said Rep William Savage DBuxton House chairman of the Legislatures Utilities Committee Maines law does not cap consumer prices as Californias does and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the states energy needs Savage said Since Maines deregulation law took effect in March Bangor HydroElectric Co rates have increased percent The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers peak load Gov Angus King and all four members of Maines congressional delegation oppose the hike The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co to mediumsized and large industrial users On the other hand some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market In the meantime legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maines deregulated energy industry One would use some of the money from the sale of powergenerating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users said Sen Norman Ferguson RHanover Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maines deregulation law but if it needs fixing it could be done during next years session The lawmakers primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead House Speaker Michael Saxl DPortland said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure ratepayers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes Michaud DEast Millinocket said hes interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern western and eastern Maine Michaud added The commission would include House and Senate members from each party a utility executive and representatives of energy producers providers a large commercial consumer and individual consumers OREGON State Senate moves to combat energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALEM Ore AP In an attempt to avoid a

and a half to a matter of months The speededup process would be in effect for two years If we can act now we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer said Sen Jason Atkinson RJacksonville Californias strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note Beyer said though California was definitely a wakeup call the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest With low rainfall hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand Beyer said Gasfired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown DPortland Conservationists however caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards WISCONSIN Two utilities to add megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved Plans of two state utilities to add megawatts to Wisconsins electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to Californias were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding said Steve Hiniker executive director of the Citizens Utility Board which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers Alliant Energy Corp announced its proposal Wednesday in a filing with the state Public Service Commission to spend billion to build one coal and two gasfired power plants Alliant has proposed building a megawatt coalfired plant and a megawatt naturalgas fired plant by It also wants to build a megawatt natural gasfired facility in Wisconsin has not built a coalfired plant in more than two decades Alliant has not determined the plants locations Also Madison Gas Electric the states smallest investorowned utility said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois Three out of the four past summers weve had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state We need to take steps to avoid that and the California situation makes that even more clear said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases but it was too early to say how much rates would go up Californias problems which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II stemmed from underestimating the states power needs forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure longterm supply contracts and freezing rates among other things But Wisconsins situation is far different The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional megawatts of power over the next decade Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added In addition coalgenerated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state We dont have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past said Hiniker This is something the PSC should be doing MGEs deals are A year contract to buy megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May The power will come from the natural gasfired plant Rock River Energy Center near Beloit Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose Califbased Calpine Energy Corp The plant is being built by Northbrook Illbased SkyGen Energy LLC which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp A year contract to buy megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp starting in May The power is coming from a natural gasfired plant near Joliet Ill owned by LS Power Co Rainy River is a unit of Duluthbased Minnesota Power Inc A fiveyear contract to buy megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova Ill in western Illinois The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co which is a unit of Iowabased MidAmerican Energy Holdings Alliant also offered support in the Wednesday filing for a billion plan of Milwaukeebased Wisconsin Energy which includes five new power plants in Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie On the

electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East

open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW

monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent

Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint

constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards

an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses

interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged

fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall

Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a

to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet

Memorandum TO Pru Sheppard BCC Suzanne Nimocks FROM Pru Sheppard B Venki Venkateshwara DATE March California Power Crisis Update No DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK The weeks highlights include Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn Jeff Gerths story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multiyear investigation of Bill Clinton The key issues are familiar Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps refunds and so on If so what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than cents on the dollar The California ISO filed a complaint claiming billion in overcharges this week The QF irony Through the s QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market In recent months in California they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output But credit problems have created an ironical situation The facts PGE and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PGE and Edison into bankruptcy Some gasfired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas Last weeks court decision allows MidAmericanCalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility CalEnergy does so immediately selling to El Paso The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO when requested regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO Reliant announced it will appeal the order This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the situations are probably different The QF contracts predate the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies In fact many QF contracts have the opposite provision authority for the utility to cut takes during socalled light load periods Stage emergency and rolling blackoutsagain There was another Stage emergency in California with rolling blackouts this week This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March Among the factors Increased demand from summerlike temperatures Cutbacks in imports Loss of MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant Loss of about MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits An internal memorandum laid out two choices The agency could audit and punish bad actors the companies that were exploiting the market Or it could identify bad hours when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobodys fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors the memorandum said The commission took the easier way It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few bad hours in January and February That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during good hours when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme The order ignored those hours Today in a criticism of the agencys lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies But the agencys track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely softpedaled its role as the electricity industrys top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials The agencys defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely handsoff approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say Californias rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits The agencys critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by freemarket passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was insufficient data in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies Yet his own former employer PGE Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the midAtlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics The agencys inaction the critics say leads to gaming jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track Were trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers Mr Hebert said Fight Over Deregulation Todays debate traces back to the s when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years Two Republican seats are currently unfilled The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late s after the agency had begun opening the gas markets By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the midAtlantic states Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market But the agencys balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AYbear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions Mr Hebert said high prices in California were sending the right signals to get supply there Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging unlawful and said that his agency by not reining them in is simply not doing its job The agencys leadership has been in flux for months Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports Though Mr Heberts positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically freemarket position of any commissioner He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces When Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies debt Mr Heberts response was dismissive Its not in the interest of the American public he pronounced Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks The midAtlantic region experienced some early volatility As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called market power the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the midAtlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate The decision roiled some agency officials Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring LocalFederal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much The industry not surprisingly shares that view One vocal critic was Mr Miller Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energytrading unit of PGE Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during Californias crisis Mr Millers former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide PGE Energy Trading by several estimates is now the secondlargest seller of electricity in New England The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PGE and other companies Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged very high prices when it could One persons predatory pricing is another persons competitive advantage Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in New England regulators too often acted as judge jury and executioner when overseeing the market he said One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New Englands problems from the regulators perspective Their Nov report attributed New Englands frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws As Mr Millers team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agencys began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New Englands ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said They said the department was examining whether PGE and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year PGE confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the departments requests Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PGE or at the agency His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PGE and his duties at the agency Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agencys San Francisco office One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show Daniel Larcamp Mr Millers supervisor said there might have been more information that could have been obtained in the California inquiry But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so timeconsuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PGE The lawyers said Mr Millers participation had been permissible because PGE was not the subject of the investigation When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market But while the companies had the potential to exercise market power the commission said there was insufficient data to prove that they did Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices When the agencys own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a lastminute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a timeconsuming investigation During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal misbehavior by sellers bad actors always seems to fail his memorandum said It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours The suggestion won the day The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several privatesector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons Because most highpriced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as just and reasonable the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis The problem with my agency is that were so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that weve gotten sloppy Mr Massey said Were talking about electricity Its the juice of the economy so its got to be available and reasonably priced Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved TULSA Okla AP Williams Cos Inc says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold overpriced electricity to California Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co a unit of Tulsabased Williams owes California more than million in refunds for power it sold to the states Independent System Operator The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for million in overcharges from transactions in January and February The Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid claims the state was overcharged billion by wholesale power providers including Williams between May and February Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO According to the commission power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions However the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams power prices Collins said The commission will review Williams explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds Allegheny

to help power Calif Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALT LAKE CITY AP The Williams Cos plans to expands its Kern River pipeline which runs through Utah to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California Williams gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line Construction on the billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May said Kirk Morgan director of business development for Kern River pipeline Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin where producers are aggressively stepping up production Morgan said The new pipeline is expected to deliver about million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah Nevada and California Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California If all of the pipelines capacity were used to generate electricity it could produce about megawatts That is enough to light around million homes Morgan said The original Kern River line was completed in It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield Calif It currently transports million cubic feet of natural gas per day Williams based in Tulsa Okla recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by million cubic feet per day That million pumping station project should be completed by July During the construction period the Kern River project will employ between and people The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from million to about million Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline Morgan said The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities including St George and Cedar City Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full

Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Some of CalEnergy Operating Corps power could end up being sold outside of California though that is not the companys intent CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday CalEnergy an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co which is majority owned by Warren Buffetts BerkshireHathaway BRKA was given legal authority Thursday to suspend megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling We stopped supplying power at PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since thenWe are selling it to marketers our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us Sokol said Sokol added that while it was his companys intention to have its power sold to California that could not be guaranteed We leave the energy selling to El PasoWeve directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we cant stop them from selling out of state Sokol said Wholesale prices on the open market are about a megawatthour three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed The courts ruling did not address the million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power and Sokol said that his companys separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utilitys assets as payment for that debt Sokol said the courts ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small independent generators known as qualifying facilities or QFs who have not received payment from SoCal Ed Edisons own lawyer said it bestthat every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market Sokol said Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadnt won the case but said he couldnt speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome A group of renewable power suppliers owed more than million from SoCal Ed said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability The utilities claim close to billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze In a statement SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergys bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergys request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors While many of the states large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California the QFs which make up onethird of the states total power supply havent been paid by SoCal Ed since November PGE has made partial payments to its QFs By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold contributed to this article California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO Californias balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison allowing it to sell power on the open market The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the states financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas Electric which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small alternative energy producerswhich together provide nearly a third of the states powerget paid But Assembly Republicans opposed it saying it hadnt been given sufficient scrutiny The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County where Edisons failure to pay CalEnergy the countys biggest property taxpayer had outsize implications CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a million property tax payment The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokols first acts after the judges ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time That is great news Leimgruber said Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market Some of the more than other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas Electric We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gasfired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a creditworthy company that in fact pays for the power An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because Californias power crisis has placed them in financial distress just as it has placed utilities in financial distress Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we cant stop them Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy million and that the companyalong with seven other small producershad been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy He said his company no longer intends to do so and he believedbut wasnt certainthat the other companies would shelve their plans Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed million to various small electricity producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam solar energy or wind The alternative energy producersand utilitiesstrenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday The bill spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the Senate on a vote the exact twothirds margin required But it stalled in the Assembly on a partyline vote well short of twothirds When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster said Thats exactly what we have before us The alternative electricity generators including oil companies warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal while representatives of Edison and PGE which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole There isnt enough money Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday It is a very simple question Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in The bill AB X combined several proposals First it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PGE must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying Additionally the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity Wind solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration But most of the alternative energy producers including Chevron and British Petroleum use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat With natural gas prices high they contend they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering Ellingwood reported from El Centro Morain from Sacramento Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at billion up from the billion first thought Californias power grid operator said Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that CalISOs figures dont take into account all their costs A Superior Court judges ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been

to power producers Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Californias electricgrid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by billion or a total of in a month period and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets Meanwhile a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energystarved state but likely at greater cost to the state government The billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO says it isnt seeking a refund for the May through February period because its analysis lacked important market data For example it estimated costs for suppliers based on published prices for natural gas not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel We dont know how much gas actually was purchased at spotmarket prices said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs head of market analysis Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO said FERC needs to become more aggressive about marketpower mitigation The ISOs filing he said was intended to push the agency in that direction since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and naturalgas markets He said that if the FERC doesnt act the state of California may find ways to discipline the market such as through the state attorney generals office The attorney general has been investigating the states electricity market for many months but hasnt brought any court action Dynegy Inc a big owner of power plants in California said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable The Houston company was one of energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling million or show cause why it should be excused Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern Californias Imperial County A judge granted geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc of Omaha Neb permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co and instead seek other buyers These plants known as qualifying facilities are under longterm contract to Edison and other utilities but havent been paid for months Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the states failed utilityderegulation plan While the CalEnergy case involves only about megawatts of power the repercussions could be far greater Collectively hundreds of qualifying facilities or QFs produce as much as of Californias electricity needs QFs totaling megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market presumably to the state government that now is Californias biggest energy buyer An hour after the court decision yesterday some megawatts of power came back into the market the ISO said However additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the states tab Already the state has allocated more than billion for electricity purchases Separately Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a writeoff of as much as billion for Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis the company hasnt yet reported yearend earnings Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals regardless of size from rolling blackouts The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investorowned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than hospitals throughout the state Under PUC rules hospitals with more than beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies But during rolling blackouts Monday at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers Linda Ziegler director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them But hospitals say there is a second lapse before emergency generators kick in which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery You wouldnt fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place said Ann Mosher a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco Backup generators are just that theyre not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis from incidents like lightning or a knockeddown power pole If its a serious problem for the hospital its certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis she said The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the states investor owned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are separately regulated For more than two decades prisons hospitals with more than beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services and are exempted from

state has been spending about million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power Gov Gray Davis has said the state isnt responsible for purchasing the costly lastminute power ISO buys for Edison and PGE despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities behalf ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California Had the decision gone the other way one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders Robinson said Damrells preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter Damrell denied the ISOs request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers Dynegy Inc DYN AES Corp AES and Williams Cos WMB which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling Spokesmen for Reliant Dynegy AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didnt immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired The judge then issued a temporary restraining order requiring the sales but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling The ISO said it would lose about megawatts if the suppliers pulled out enough power for about million households One megawatt is enough for roughly homes Grid officials said Reliants share alone is about megawatts Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that because most of its output is already committed under longterm contracts Reliant which currently provides about of the states power worries it wont get paid due to the financial troubles of PGE and Edison PGE and

Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Many of Californias independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the states three investorowned utilities At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the states Public Utilities Code which links the socalled qualifying facilities electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas Lawmakers however are poised to pass the legislation State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric from a megawatthour to MWh regardless of the price of natural gas Whereas each of the QF contracts differed largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities The cogeneration facilities which produce about megawatts of electricity in the state said the rates are too low and they wont sign new supply contracts with the utilities For MWh natural gas would have to be per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border said Tom Lu executive director of Carsonbased Watson Cogeneration Company the states largest QF generating MW Our current gas price at the border is Other gasfired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week Lu whose company is halfowned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed million by SoCal Ed said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse David Fogarty spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association whose members supply California with more than MW said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than billion for electricity that was already produced State Loses MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about onethird or MW of the states total power supply Roughly MW are produced by natural gasfired facilities The rest is generated by wind solar power and biomass About MW of gasfired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners havent been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cashstrapped utilities SoCal Ed and PGE for nearly four months Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates The defaults have left many of the renewable and gasfired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they cant afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the states utilities but arent being paid even on a forward basis The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electricity grid said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday Gov Gray Davis recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of MWh and MWh for five and year contracts He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward After next week the QF problem will be behind us Davis said Tuesday We want to get the QFs paidthe QFs are dropping like fliesand when that happens the lights go out But this just makes the problem worse said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter a member of the Assembly energy committee I dont know how we are going to keep the lights on Florez said in an interview Many of these congenerators are in my district They said if the legislation doesnt change they are going offline This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts especially now when we need every megawatt Davis who didnt meet with people representing the QFs said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a fiveyear price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities In addition SOCal Ed opposed the legislation saying the rates should be below MWh Some renewable power producers said they arent vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities said his group of gasfired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said Hal Dittmer president of Sacramentobased Wellhead Electric in Sacramento which is owed million by PGE has MW of gasfired generation units offline Under the states plan Dittmer said he risks going out of business I cant buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision he said

administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market After two days of statewide blackouts power plants that had been shut down were cranked up Unseasonable heat tapered off The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency But plenty of ominous signs remained Many small producers remained shut down skeptical about Gov Gray Davis plan for utilities to pay them State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the states foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only megawatts of electricity significantly less than the to megawatts previously claimed While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of

amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators said the report represents a work in progress He said the state may yet sign new contracts However Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to realtime meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand The head of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient

November But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal sources But most of them generate power using natural gasand the cost of natural gas has been soaring Several natural gas

alternative suppliers including solar biomass and wind power units cut their normal supply to the system in half They say Edison and PGE have not paid them since November the utilities say they are out of cash Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost individual contractors Another delaying factor said Keeley who with state Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers prices was the huge enmity manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities These people just dont like each other This weeks blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration When it comes to electricity size doesnt matterevery kilowatt counts During peak use a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts There is no such thing as a partial solution Unless the whole energy equation is balanced the parts dont work For the Davis plan to work several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the already set in motion The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through longterm contracts with the big outofstate producers These contracts the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group The administration says it has concluded contracts with generators about half of which have been signed According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned billion bond offering to succeed The bonds set for sale in May will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity The state is currently spending at a rate of million a day to buy power If prices stay high the billion in bonds will not cover the states power purchases by the end of the summer Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment Angelides has estimated that under the January law that put the state in the power buying business the state must be reimbursed billion annually and that billion is needed to service the debt PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers known as qualifying facilities must be cut at least in half down from an average of more than cents per kilowatthour In his news conference Tuesday Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at cents for year contracts and cents for fiveyear contracts Meanwhile PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid Lynch said The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they havent been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation said John Nelson a spokesman for PGE The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves mainly from hydro and nuclear sources at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the nearbankrupt utilities to solvency Times staff writers Julie Tamaki Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog As part of secret deal to get longterm energy contracts state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions Critics renew call for full disclosure DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As part of his closeddoor negotiations to buy electricity Gov Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air Davis said Tuesday Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with generators to supply billion worth of power during the next years However the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms contending that release of such information would hamper the states ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity Sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc a power company based in Houston is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the companys deal with the state We couldnt get them to sign contracts it was a sticking point Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM Under the system companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution If their operations pollute more companies are required to purchase credits on an open market Currently the credits cost about per pound of pollutionan amount that can lead to a bill of well over million a year for a power plant The South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the systema step that could considerably cut the states potential cost Davis said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power companys costs It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power she said If it brings down the price of power I dont have a problem with it Nevertheless word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts the critics note The Legislature should have known about it said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco It is going to cost taxpayers money It makes you wonder This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature V John White a lobbyist for the Sierra Club who also represents alternative energy producers called the contract proposal a horrible precedent Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents we cant determine how serious the breach of principle this is White said Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations Terry Francke general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light In the summer when demand for power is highest some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts To avert blackouts state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running In such cases some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any finesalthough Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollutionrelated measures The company which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County said its aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment rose to million in from million in A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegys facilities appear to be fairly cleanalthough Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil which is dirtier than natural gas Davis said he intends to make this information public but he added that we do not want to put the publics interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices Nobody likes the notion that the administration is not being fully forthcoming Davis said But I also have a corollary responsibility that I dont stick these generators with a higher rate FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Following a preliminary nonpublic investigation FERC directed AES Southland Inc and Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co IN on March to show cause why they did not violate section of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability mustrun RMR generator units during a period in April and May The investigation responded to a matter referred by the CalISO If a violation is found Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their marketbased rate authority for a year The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission The CalISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network The CalISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR units availability and a variable payment for the RMR units output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market Williams Energy and the CalISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the CalISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intrazonal congestion The ISO may dispatch a nonRMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available Under its RMR agreement with the ISO Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units However if a nonRMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable Williams will be paid its bid price not the RMR contract price During the April to May period the CalISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos and Huntington Beach as RMR units to provide voltage support However according to the FERC order Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos available from April through May and to make Huntington Beach available from May through May for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units Consequently the CalISO was forced to dispatch nonRMR units at a higher cost namely Williams Energys bid price for service provided by the replacement units By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energys variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units output Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May The bid price for the nonRMR units was at or near the CalISOs theneffective bid cap of MWh FERC continued Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the CalISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the nonRMR units approximately MWh during the period in question This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million The information in this order and a nonpublic appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons Based on this information coupled with Williams Energys financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the CalISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its marketbased rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the CalISOs tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue and whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations a refund by Williams Energy andor AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available and a condition on Williams Energys marketbased rate authority Specifically for a oneyear period if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the CalISO a nonRMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract In other words Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute non RMR unit The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the abovedescribed violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed Further to ensure procurement of all relevant information the Commission instituted a formal nonpublic investigation into the operation maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in and Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California consumers havent been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts consumers arent using less electricity which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid As a result blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities the ISO said ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option but consumers in the state arent heeding the call to reduce consumption Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan and Jan when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints Jim Detmers the ISOs vice president of operation said consumers saved the state about megawatts of electricity enough power for million houses The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about MW or less We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time Detmers said The states Energy Commission said consumers think its no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed People have been saving generally but it isnt a big bump from hour to hour a spokesman for the Energy Commission said Gov Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least of electricity compared with last summer The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Gas Cos Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs Though consumers get a share of the windfall regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus which is expected to be huge this year as a form of price relief The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co Through vigorous deal making the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down For several years the utility has been splitting the savings with ratepayers whenever the companys gas costs fall slightly below market levels Those savings Gas Co executives acknowledged have shot to unprecedented heights during the states power crisis Now in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices regulators are taking another look at the program The question before the Public Utilities Commission Should Gas Co ratepayers who endured huge bill increases this winter get a bigger share of the savings The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded million But the amount for the last months is expected to multiply many times over company executives said partly because the Gas Co has done so well in the wild market by selling lending and trading gas as well as buying it The recent market conditions could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers the PUCs consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates reported Oct even before the latest upward market spirals Gas Co representatives express frustration saying they have done what the state has requested under its gascost incentive program Buy smarter and pass the savings along to its million residential and smallbusiness customers The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost The PUC every time we do well raises the bar on us said Jim Harrigan director of gas acquisition I dont necessarily agree with it By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity the Gas Co has become a big player in the regional natural gas market In the companys bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters employees track price movements pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along Californias border where prices have rocketed The PUC created the cost incentive program for the states three major gas utilitiesSan Diego Gas Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co in Like Southern California Gas SDGE is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Cos trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings Californias gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers monthly gas bills but are not itemized At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed Theres no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the companys award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from belowmarket gas and transportation costs In the early years of the program records show the Gas Cos awards went from zero to million million million and million Last years award of million is awaiting PUC approval This years proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was wellequipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said Harrigan said however that he does not believe the companys level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this years incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June I dont want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the companys award I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers It has been immense Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities The companys gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet Thats more than twice last years cost but only about half what sister company SDGE paid for its customers in February Its also much lower than the per therm PGE pays We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needsabout to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier This presents opportunities At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border With gas price runups like those seen in the last year Pocta said there is a question Should that benefit be shared or flow entirely to ratepayers Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals By the same token we want the Gas Co to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added We want them to have incentives The question is how to balance them Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January The company makes gas sales at various locations It engages in exchanges It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division Before they were lots more riskaverse Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them Records show that the shared savings at SDGE a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gasfired electricitygenerating plants He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year In an annual report to the PUC in February PGE said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer advocacy group said it will closely watch the PUCs evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co We want to make sure given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said Well look to see whether the mechanism should be changed Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter longterm contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market Unfortunately under the system he said the only incentive is to beat the spot market Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section See attached file Dow Jones

Wednesday March Energy Insight Embedded image moved to file picpcx By Dave Todd US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising energy prices Delivering the keynote address at the US Chamber of Commerces national energy summit in Washington Monday Abraham said California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians Not very says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels managing director of Bostonbased METIS Trading Advisors Krapels a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities such as Consolidated Edison design markethedging programs adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the countrys economy in respect to energy security management First of all New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California he said California has hydro nuclear and gas but when it lost a lot of hydro the state needed gas to pick up the slack and the capacity just wasnt there In New Yorks case the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than Californias Krapels added New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning Californias marketplace New Yorks Independent System Operator ISO in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining instate generation capacity reserve margins and a strategy must be put in place whether or not new generation comes online in accordance with current anticipated scenarios A measure of New Yorks essential difficulty is that between and statewide demand for electricity grew MW while generating capacity expanded by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved the gap is expected to continue to widen To avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the states daily generating capacity needs to grow by MW by with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear the ISO wants to see a stateappointed ombudsman named to help wouldbe merchant power plant investors plow through red tape Increasing New Yorks generating capacity will also lessen the states escalating and risky reliance on outofstate sources of electricity the ISO added Since New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from instate sources Not everyone agrees with that analysis insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down interjurisdictional barriers In any case New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the US Northeast such as PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool are in vastly better shape in terms of crossborder cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market In California by contrast the states focusfor example in the case of new gasfired power plant developmenthas been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone rather than on a regional marketplace Embedded image moved to file picpcx The New York ISOs new broadbased analysis of marketrestructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New Yorks utilities to enter into longterm power contracts What needs to be done most it says is to move aggressively to build some of the more than MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline In the meantime the MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldnt be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early longrange weather forecasts Demand however is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to So while New York City the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year it could be a brief rest from the fray Meanwhile a shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan on Long Island and even on barges offshore One way or another whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities its going to be a hot time in the city Longterm solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile attempts at longerterm solutions continue to run into trouble Last week Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that HydroQuebec subsidiary TransEnergie US Ltd wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authoritys load pocket Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound the proposal failed to convince authorities who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut In similar fashion private companies wanting to build small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizationssome of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany The David vs Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good But suddenly in New York Californias troubleswhile still distant in their intensity may not be so far away By some estimates this summers bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last years charges Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isnt going to make the pain go away NEW YORK NYISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES NYISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NYISO said in a recent report Power Alert New Yorks Energy Crossroads New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NYISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report This report is essentially a caution light at New Yorks energy crossroads Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NYISOs warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline In a related development the NYISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NYISOs socalled temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse The NYISO Report The NYISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply The NYISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NYISO said this gap will continue to widen The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New Yorks power consumers The NYISOs modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs Besides large rate increases the NYISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on outofstate resources The report said that if no new instate generation comes on line in the next five years the states generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by Pointing to Californias situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities To avoid these harsh consequences the NYISO said New Yorks new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built The problem according to the NYISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made The NYISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gasfired units On a more positive note the NYISO reported that New Yorks restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter longterm power contracts The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial The report also recommended accelerating conservation realtime metering and pricesensitive load programs and upgrading the states and the Northeasts transmission infrastructure The Proposed Tariff Amendments New Yorks Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NYISOs request to extend from until its MWh bid caps FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them The NYISOs board is sensitive to the Commissions concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related Nevertheless the NYISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York states Article X process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth Moreover although the NYISO proposes to implement several demandside measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently priceresponsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demandside response Thus the NYISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NYISOs proposed demandside response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces Other problems cited in the NYISOs filing which keep New Yorks power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the states CentralEast interface and questions over adequate gas supply The NYISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued Nevertheless the NYISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJMs markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NYISOs bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets The NYISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high runups in prices The NYISOs request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through cited similar problems with New Yorks power markets but claimed that the NYISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws The TEPs were and remain an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NYISO and the Commission intended the filing insisted MASSACHUSETTS Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOSTON AP The states top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see Californiatype electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press Our major problem will come this summer State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California and on Monday California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in to attract more companies to stir competition But that hasnt happened yet largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition said Reilly a Democrat That competition in the wholesale market is not happening Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the regions power A spokeswoman for the regions power grid said electricity use is expected to rise to percent this year but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past months The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand said Ellen Foley spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc which manages the grid of generators connected by miles of high voltage transmission lines Still a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity a situation that arose once last summer Foley said In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation Those customers typically pay more than longterm customers Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into twoyear contracts with suppliers instead of the sixmonth contracts many have now to avoid shortterm price spikes for consumers Reilly said The Attorney Generals Office acts as an advocate for consumers Michael Monahan a spokesman for NSTAR which provides electricity to more than million customers is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod but currently has no lines under construction I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that its something we have to focus on Monahan said but he added The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity Californias statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero California partially deregulated its electric industry in two years

Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CARSON CITY Nev AP Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid Californiastyle energy problems The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure its constitutional said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend RReno And thats not as easy as it sounds Townsends comment just before his committee began working on SB was prophetic witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure Translation Dont kill all deals by stopping Renobased Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegasbased Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June and possibly until Pete Ernaut a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before a deal that would be in the publics interest If you put a twoyear moratorium on these plants all these deals are going to go away he said When the cow leaves the barn its difficult to catch Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB on Monday Now its up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee Reliant isnt the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive Earlier this month executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that its in the publics interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant The Harry Allen plant produces about megawatts out of the megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate Pinnacle has plans to expand that to megawatts by Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts dont have to be included in SB Townsend said Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills but the power plant sale issue must be handled now Nevadas PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies merger in under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the states electricity and if theyre sold the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from billion to billion by July if the power plant sales are stopped Nevadas Consumer Advocates Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of million in savings MAINE Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved AUGUSTA Maine AP In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state Maines top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis A panel of industry insiders elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anticompetitive activities In addition the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maines deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity improve conservation and spur competition The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state Maines deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls said Rep William Savage DBuxton House chairman of the Legislatures Utilities Committee Maines law does not cap consumer prices as Californias does and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the states energy needs Savage said Since Maines deregulation law took effect in March Bangor HydroElectric Co rates have increased percent The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers peak load Gov Angus King and all four members of Maines congressional delegation oppose the hike The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co to mediumsized and large industrial users On the other hand some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market In the meantime legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maines deregulated energy industry One would use some of the money from the sale of powergenerating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users said Sen Norman Ferguson RHanover Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maines deregulation law but if it needs fixing it could be done during next years session The lawmakers primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead House Speaker Michael Saxl DPortland said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure ratepayers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes Michaud DEast Millinocket said hes interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern western and eastern Maine Michaud added The commission would include House and Senate members from each party a utility executive and representatives of energy producers providers a large commercial consumer and individual consumers OREGON State Senate moves to combat energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALEM Ore AP In an attempt to avoid a Californialike energy crisis the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources Its important for Oregon It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone said Sen Lee Beyer DSpringfield The measure SB would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources like wind from a year and a half to a matter of months The speededup process would be in effect for two years If we can act now we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer said Sen Jason Atkinson RJacksonville Californias strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note Beyer said though California was definitely a wakeup call the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest With low rainfall hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand Beyer said Gasfired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown DPortland Conservationists however caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards WISCONSIN Two utilities to add megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved Plans of two state utilities to add megawatts to Wisconsins electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to Californias were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding said Steve Hiniker executive director of the Citizens Utility Board which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers Alliant Energy Corp announced its proposal Wednesday in a filing with the state Public Service Commission to spend billion to build one coal and two gasfired power plants Alliant has proposed building a megawatt coalfired plant and a megawatt naturalgas fired plant by It also wants to build a megawatt natural gasfired facility in Wisconsin has not built a coalfired plant in more than two decades Alliant has not determined the plants locations Also Madison Gas Electric the states smallest investorowned utility said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois Three out of the four past summers weve had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state We need to take steps to avoid that and the California situation makes that even more clear said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases but it was too early to say how much rates would go up Californias problems which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II stemmed from underestimating the states power needs forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure longterm supply contracts and freezing rates among other things But Wisconsins situation is far different The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional megawatts of power over the next decade Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added In addition coalgenerated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state We dont have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past said Hiniker This is something the PSC should be doing MGEs deals are A year contract to buy megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May The power will come from the natural gasfired plant Rock River Energy Center near Beloit Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose Califbased Calpine Energy Corp The plant is being built by Northbrook Illbased SkyGen Energy LLC which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp A year contract to buy megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp starting in May The power is coming from a natural gasfired plant near Joliet Ill owned by LS Power Co Rainy River is a unit of Duluthbased Minnesota Power Inc A fiveyear contract to buy megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova Ill in western Illinois The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co which is a unit of Iowabased MidAmerican

Memorandum TO Pru Sheppard BCC Suzanne Nimocks FROM Pru Sheppard B Venki Venkateshwara DATE March California Power Crisis Update No DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK The weeks highlights include Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn Jeff Gerths story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multiyear investigation of Bill Clinton The key issues are familiar Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps refunds and so on If so what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than cents on the dollar The California ISO filed a complaint claiming billion in overcharges this week The QF irony Through the s QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market In recent months in California they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output But credit problems have created an ironical situation The facts PGE and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PGE and Edison into bankruptcy Some gasfired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas Last weeks court decision allows MidAmericanCalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility CalEnergy does so immediately selling to El Paso The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO when requested regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO Reliant announced it will appeal the order This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the situations are probably different The QF contracts predate the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies In fact many QF contracts have the opposite provision authority for the utility to cut takes during socalled light load periods Stage emergency and rolling blackoutsagain There was another Stage emergency in California with rolling blackouts this week This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March Among the factors Increased demand from summerlike temperatures Cutbacks in imports Loss of MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant Loss of about MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits An internal memorandum laid out two choices The agency could audit and punish bad actors the companies that were exploiting the market Or it could identify bad hours when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobodys fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors the memorandum said The commission took the easier way It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few bad hours in January and February That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during good hours when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme The order ignored those hours Today in a criticism of the agencys lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies But the agencys track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely softpedaled its role as the electricity industrys top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials The agencys defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely handsoff approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say Californias rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits The agencys critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by freemarket passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was insufficient data in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies Yet his own former employer PGE Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the midAtlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics The agencys inaction the critics say leads to gaming jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track Were trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers Mr Hebert said Fight Over Deregulation Todays debate traces back to the s when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years Two Republican seats are currently unfilled The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late s after the agency had begun opening the gas markets By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the midAtlantic states Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market But the agencys balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AYbear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions Mr Hebert said high prices in California were sending the right signals to get supply there Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging unlawful and said that his agency by not reining them in is simply not doing its job The agencys leadership has been in flux for months Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports Though Mr Heberts positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically freemarket position of any commissioner He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces When Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies debt Mr Heberts response was dismissive Its not in the interest of the American public he pronounced Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks The midAtlantic region experienced some early volatility As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called market power the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the midAtlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate The decision roiled some agency officials Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring LocalFederal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much The industry not surprisingly shares that view One vocal critic was Mr Miller Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energytrading unit of PGE Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during Californias crisis Mr Millers former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide PGE Energy Trading by several estimates is now the secondlargest seller of electricity in New England The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PGE and other companies Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged very high prices when it could One persons predatory pricing is another persons competitive advantage Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in New England regulators too often acted as judge jury and executioner when overseeing the market he said One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New Englands problems from the regulators perspective Their Nov report attributed New Englands frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws As Mr Millers team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agencys began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New Englands ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said They said the department was examining whether PGE and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year PGE confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the departments requests Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PGE or at the agency His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PGE and his duties at the agency Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agencys San Francisco office One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show Daniel Larcamp Mr Millers supervisor said there might have been more information that could have been obtained in the California inquiry But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so timeconsuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PGE The lawyers said Mr Millers participation had been permissible because PGE was not the subject of the investigation When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market But while the companies had the potential to exercise market power the commission said there was insufficient data to prove that they did Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices When the agencys own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a lastminute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a timeconsuming investigation During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal misbehavior by sellers bad actors always seems to fail his memorandum said It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours The suggestion won the day The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several privatesector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons Because most highpriced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as just and reasonable the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis The problem with my agency is that were so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that weve gotten sloppy Mr Massey said Were talking about electricity Its the juice of the economy so its got to be available and reasonably priced Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved TULSA Okla AP Williams Cos Inc says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold overpriced electricity to California Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co a unit of Tulsabased Williams owes California more than million in refunds for power it sold to the states Independent System Operator The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for million in overcharges from transactions in January and February The Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid claims the state was overcharged billion by wholesale power providers including Williams between May and February Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO According to the commission power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions However the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams power prices Collins said The commission will review Williams explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds Allegheny Energy makes big California connection Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved HAGERSTOWN Md AP Allegheny Energy Inc said Thursday it has agreed to sell billion worth of power to Californias electricitypurchasing agency over the next years The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to megawatts that the Hagerstownbased company has secured from western generating plants through its new energy trading division Allegheny Energy Global Markets formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets This is a winwin for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy It provides a longterm source of fixedprice energy and should help to stabilize prices in California said Michael P Morrell president of the Allegheny Energy Supply division Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power which delivers electric energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALT LAKE CITY AP The Williams Cos plans to expands its Kern River pipeline which runs through Utah to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California Williams gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line Construction on the billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May said Kirk Morgan director of business development for Kern River pipeline Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin where producers are aggressively stepping up production Morgan said The new pipeline is expected to deliver about million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah Nevada and California Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California If all of the pipelines capacity were used to generate electricity it could produce about megawatts That is enough to light around million homes Morgan said The original Kern River line was completed in It enters Utah from

Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Some of CalEnergy Operating Corps power could end up being sold outside of California though that is not the companys intent CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday CalEnergy an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co which is majority owned by Warren Buffetts BerkshireHathaway BRKA was given legal authority Thursday to suspend megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling We stopped supplying power at PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since thenWe are selling it to marketers our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us Sokol said Sokol added that while it was his companys intention to have its power sold to California that could not be guaranteed We leave the energy selling to El PasoWeve directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we cant stop them from selling out of state Sokol said Wholesale prices on the open market are about a megawatthour three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed The courts ruling did not address the million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power and Sokol said that his companys separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utilitys assets as payment for that debt Sokol said the courts ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small independent generators known as qualifying facilities or QFs who have not received payment from SoCal Ed Edisons own lawyer said it bestthat every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market Sokol said Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadnt won the case but said he couldnt speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome A group of renewable power suppliers owed more than million from SoCal Ed said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability The utilities claim close to billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze In a statement SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergys bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergys request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors While many of the states large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California the QFs which make up onethird of the states total power supply havent been paid by SoCal Ed since November PGE has made partial payments to its QFs By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold contributed to this article California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO Californias balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison allowing it to sell power on the open market The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the states financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas Electric which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small alternative energy producerswhich together provide nearly a third of the states powerget paid But Assembly Republicans opposed it saying it hadnt been given sufficient scrutiny The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County where Edisons failure to pay CalEnergy the countys biggest property taxpayer had outsize implications CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a million property tax payment The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokols first acts after the judges ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time That is great news Leimgruber said Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market Some of the more than other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas Electric We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gasfired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a creditworthy company that in fact pays for the power An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because Californias power crisis has placed them in financial distress just as it has placed utilities in financial distress Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we cant stop them Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy million and that the companyalong with seven other small producershad been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy He said his company no longer intends to do so and he believedbut wasnt certainthat the other companies would shelve their plans Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed million to various small electricity producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam solar energy or wind The alternative energy producersand utilitiesstrenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday The bill spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the Senate on a vote the exact twothirds margin required But it stalled in the Assembly on a partyline vote well short of twothirds When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster said Thats exactly what we have before us The alternative electricity generators including oil companies warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal while representatives of Edison and PGE which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole There isnt enough money Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday It is a very simple question Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in The bill AB X combined several proposals First it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PGE must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying Additionally the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity Wind solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration But most of the alternative energy producers including Chevron and British Petroleum use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat With natural gas prices high they contend they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering Ellingwood reported from El Centro Morain from Sacramento Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at billion up from the billion first thought Californias power grid operator said Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that CalISOs figures dont take into account all their costs A Superior Court judges ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been

to power producers Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Californias electricgrid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by billion or a total of in a month period and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets Meanwhile a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energystarved state but likely at greater cost to the state government The billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO says it isnt seeking a refund for the May through February period because its analysis lacked important market data For example it estimated costs for suppliers based on published prices for natural gas not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel We dont know how much gas actually was purchased at spotmarket prices said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs head of market analysis Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO said FERC needs to become more aggressive about marketpower mitigation The ISOs filing he said was intended to push the agency in that direction since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and naturalgas markets He said that if the FERC doesnt act the state of California may find ways to discipline the market such as through the state attorney generals office The attorney general has been investigating the states electricity market for many months but hasnt brought any court action Dynegy Inc a big owner of power plants in California said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable The Houston company was one of energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling million or show cause why it should be excused Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern Californias Imperial County A judge granted geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc of Omaha Neb permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co and instead seek other buyers These plants known as qualifying facilities are under longterm contract to Edison and other utilities but havent been paid for months Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the states failed utilityderegulation plan While the CalEnergy case involves only about megawatts of power the repercussions could be far greater Collectively hundreds of qualifying facilities or QFs produce as much as of Californias electricity needs QFs totaling megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market presumably to the state government that now is Californias biggest energy buyer An hour after the court decision yesterday some megawatts of power came back into the market the ISO said However additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the states tab Already the state has allocated more than billion for electricity purchases Separately Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a writeoff of as much as billion for Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis the company hasnt yet reported yearend earnings Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals regardless of size from rolling blackouts The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investorowned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than hospitals throughout the state Under PUC rules hospitals with more than beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies But during rolling blackouts Monday at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers Linda Ziegler director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them But hospitals say there is a second lapse before emergency generators kick in which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery You wouldnt fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place said Ann Mosher a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco Backup generators are just that theyre not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis from incidents like lightning or a knockeddown power pole If its a serious problem for the hospital its certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis she said The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the states investor owned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are separately regulated For more than two decades prisons hospitals with more than beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services and are exempted from

on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply Damrell dismissed Reliants attempt to force the state Department of Water Resources to back the ISOs purchases for the states two biggest utilities The state has been spending about million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power Gov Gray Davis has said the state isnt responsible for purchasing the costly lastminute power ISO buys for Edison and PGE despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities behalf ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California Had the decision gone the other way one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders Robinson said Damrells preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter Damrell denied the ISOs request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers Dynegy Inc DYN AES Corp AES and Williams Cos WMB which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling Spokesmen for Reliant Dynegy AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didnt immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired The judge then issued a temporary restraining order requiring the sales but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling The ISO said it would lose about megawatts if the suppliers pulled out enough power for about million households One megawatt is enough for roughly homes Grid officials said Reliants share alone is about megawatts Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that because most of its output is already committed under longterm contracts Reliant which currently provides about of the states power worries it wont get paid due to the financial troubles of PGE and Edison PGE and

Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Many of Californias independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the states three investorowned utilities At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the states Public Utilities Code which links the socalled qualifying facilities electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas Lawmakers however are poised to pass the legislation State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric from a megawatthour to MWh regardless of the price of natural gas Whereas each of the QF contracts differed largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities The cogeneration facilities which produce about megawatts of electricity in the state said the rates are too low and they wont sign new supply contracts with the utilities For MWh natural gas would have to be per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border said Tom Lu executive director of Carsonbased Watson Cogeneration Company the states largest QF generating MW Our current gas price at the border is Other gasfired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week Lu whose company is halfowned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed million by SoCal Ed said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse David Fogarty spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association whose members supply California with more than MW said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than billion for electricity that was already produced State Loses MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about onethird or MW of the states total power supply Roughly MW are produced by natural gasfired facilities The rest is generated by wind solar power and biomass About MW of gasfired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners havent been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cashstrapped utilities SoCal Ed and PGE for nearly four months Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates The defaults have left many of the renewable and gasfired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they cant afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the states utilities but arent being paid even on a forward basis The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electricity grid said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday Gov Gray Davis recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of MWh and MWh for five and year contracts He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward After next week the QF problem will be behind us Davis said Tuesday We want to get the QFs paidthe QFs are dropping like fliesand when that happens the lights go out But this just makes the problem worse said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter a member of the Assembly energy committee I dont know how we are going to keep the lights on Florez said in an interview Many of these congenerators are in my district They said if the legislation doesnt change they are going offline This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts especially now when we need every megawatt Davis who didnt meet with people representing the QFs said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a fiveyear price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities In addition SOCal Ed opposed the legislation saying the rates should be below MWh Some renewable power producers said they arent vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities said his group of gasfired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said Hal Dittmer president of Sacramentobased Wellhead Electric in Sacramento which is owed million by PGE has MW of gasfired generation units offline Under the states plan Dittmer said he risks going out of business I cant buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision he said

MORAIN JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market After two days of statewide blackouts power plants that had been shut down were cranked up Unseasonable heat tapered off The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency But plenty of ominous signs remained Many small producers remained shut down skeptical about Gov Gray Davis plan for utilities to pay them State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the states foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only megawatts of electricity significantly less than the to megawatts previously claimed While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons including the states failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July The Legislature has approved plans to sell billion in bonds but none have yet been issued We are exposed

amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators said the report represents a work in progress He said the state may yet sign new contracts However Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to realtime meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand The head of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient

November But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal sources But most of them generate power using natural gasand the cost of natural gas has been soaring Several natural gas users said Davis plan which caps rates wont cover their fuel costs Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall But small generators say they dont have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis proposal next week It offers producers two choices cents a kilowatthour if they agree to supply

California for a second day Tuesday a key consultant to Gov Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the states largest utilities are proceeding at an accelerated pace Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days although those with PGE are much less advanced The administration and PGE have not reached even an agreement in principle he said PGE which has more debt than Edison says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart The state wants to buy the utilities transmission lines and other assets for about billion to provide cash to the utilities help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months To research the grid purchase Fichera said the state has had to pore over documents just to assess the utilities liabilities We are working at a good pace said Fichera chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners If we get to a dealbreaker it might be longer By making Fichera who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission available to reporters Tuesday the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governors plan to pull the state out of the crisis Since midJanuary when the big utilities credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them the state has spent nearly billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas Oklahoma Georgia and North Carolina Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the states electricity The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cashstrapped alternative suppliers including solar biomass and wind power units cut their normal supply to the system in half They say Edison and PGE have not paid them since November the utilities say they are out of cash Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost individual contractors Another delaying factor said Keeley who with state Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers prices was the huge enmity manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities These people just dont like each other This weeks blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration When it comes to electricity size doesnt matterevery kilowatt counts During peak use a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts There is no such thing as a partial solution Unless the whole energy equation is balanced the parts dont work For the Davis plan to work several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the already set in motion The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through longterm contracts with the big outofstate producers These contracts the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group The administration says it has concluded contracts with generators about half of which have been signed According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned billion bond offering to succeed The bonds set for sale in May will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity The state is currently spending at a rate of million a day to buy power If prices stay high the billion in bonds will not cover the states power purchases by the end of the summer Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment Angelides has estimated that under the January law that put the state in the power buying business the state must be reimbursed billion annually and that billion is needed to service the debt PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers known as qualifying facilities must be cut at least in half down from an average of more than cents per kilowatthour In his news conference Tuesday Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at cents for year contracts and cents for fiveyear contracts Meanwhile PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid Lynch said The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they havent been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation said John Nelson a spokesman for PGE The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves mainly from hydro and nuclear sources at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the nearbankrupt utilities to solvency Times staff writers Julie Tamaki Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog As part of secret deal to get longterm energy contracts state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions Critics renew call for full disclosure DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As part of his closeddoor negotiations to buy electricity Gov Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air Davis said Tuesday Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with generators to supply billion worth of power during the next years However the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms contending that release of such information would hamper the states ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity Sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc a power company based in Houston is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the companys deal with the state We couldnt get them to sign contracts it was a sticking point Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM Under the system companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution If their operations pollute more companies are required to purchase credits on an open market Currently the credits cost about per pound of pollutionan amount that can lead to a bill of well over million a year for a power plant The South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the systema step that could considerably cut the states potential cost Davis said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power companys costs It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power she said If it brings down the price of power I dont have a problem with it Nevertheless word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts the critics note The Legislature should have known about it said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco It is going to cost taxpayers money It makes you wonder This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature V John White a lobbyist for the Sierra Club who also represents alternative energy producers called the contract proposal a horrible precedent Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents we cant determine how serious the breach of principle this is White said Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations Terry Francke general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light In the summer when demand for power is highest some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts To avert blackouts state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running In such cases some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any finesalthough Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollutionrelated measures The company which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County said its aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment rose to million in from million in A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegys facilities appear to be fairly cleanalthough Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil which is dirtier than natural gas Davis said he intends to make this information public but he added that we do not want to put the publics interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices Nobody likes the notion that the administration is not being fully forthcoming Davis said But I also have a corollary responsibility that I dont stick these generators with a higher rate FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Following a preliminary nonpublic investigation FERC directed AES Southland Inc and Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co IN on March to show cause why they did not violate section of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability mustrun RMR generator units during a period in April and May The investigation responded to a matter referred by the CalISO If a violation is found Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their marketbased rate authority for a year The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission The CalISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network The CalISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR units availability and a variable payment for the RMR units output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market Williams Energy and the CalISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the CalISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intrazonal congestion The ISO may dispatch a nonRMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available Under its RMR agreement with the ISO Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units However if a nonRMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable Williams will be paid its bid price not the RMR contract price During the April to May period the CalISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos and Huntington Beach as RMR units to provide voltage support However according to the FERC order Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos available from April through May and to make Huntington Beach available from May through May for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units Consequently the CalISO was forced to dispatch nonRMR units at a higher cost namely Williams Energys bid price for service provided by the replacement units By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energys variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units output Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May The bid price for the nonRMR units was at or near the CalISOs theneffective bid cap of MWh FERC continued Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the CalISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the nonRMR units approximately MWh during the period in question This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million The information in this order and a nonpublic appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons Based on this information coupled with Williams Energys financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the CalISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its marketbased rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the CalISOs tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue and whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations a refund by Williams Energy andor AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available and a condition on Williams Energys marketbased rate authority Specifically for a oneyear period if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the CalISO a nonRMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract In other words Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute non RMR unit The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the abovedescribed violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed Further to ensure procurement of all relevant information the Commission instituted a formal nonpublic investigation into the operation maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in and Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California consumers havent been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts consumers arent using less electricity which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid As a result blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities the ISO said ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option but consumers in the state arent heeding the call to reduce consumption Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan and Jan when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints Jim Detmers the ISOs vice president of operation said consumers saved the state about megawatts of electricity enough power for million houses The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about MW or less We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time Detmers said The states Energy Commission said consumers think its no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed People have been saving generally but it isnt a big bump from hour to hour a spokesman for the Energy Commission said Gov Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least of electricity compared with last summer The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Gas Cos Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs Though consumers get a share of the windfall regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus which is expected to be huge this year as a form of price relief The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co Through vigorous deal making the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down For several years the utility has been splitting the savings with ratepayers whenever the companys gas costs fall slightly below market levels Those savings Gas Co executives acknowledged have shot to unprecedented heights during the states power crisis Now in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices regulators are taking another look at the program The question before the Public Utilities Commission Should Gas Co ratepayers who endured huge bill increases this winter get a bigger share of the savings The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded million But the amount for the last months is expected to multiply many times over company executives said partly because the Gas Co has done so well in the wild market by selling lending and trading gas as well as buying it The recent market conditions could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers the PUCs consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates reported Oct even before the latest upward market spirals Gas Co representatives express frustration saying they have done what the state has requested under its gascost incentive program Buy smarter and pass the savings along to its million residential and smallbusiness customers The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost The PUC every time we do well raises the bar on us said Jim Harrigan director of gas acquisition I dont necessarily agree with it By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity the Gas Co has become a big player in the regional natural gas market In the companys bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters employees track price movements pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along Californias border where prices have rocketed The PUC created the cost incentive program for the states three major gas utilitiesSan Diego Gas Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co in Like Southern California Gas SDGE is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Cos trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings Californias gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers monthly gas bills but are not itemized At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed Theres no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the companys award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from belowmarket gas and transportation costs In the early years of the program records show the Gas Cos awards went from zero to million million million and million Last years award of million is awaiting PUC approval This years proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was wellequipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said Harrigan said however that he does not believe the companys level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this years incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June I dont want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the companys award I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers It has been immense Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities The companys gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet Thats more than twice last years cost but only about half what sister company SDGE paid for its customers in February Its also much lower than the per therm PGE pays We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needsabout to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier This presents opportunities At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border With gas price runups like those seen in the last year Pocta said there is a question Should that benefit be shared or flow entirely to ratepayers Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals By the same token we want the Gas Co to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added We want them to have incentives The question is how to balance them Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January The company makes gas sales at various locations It engages in exchanges It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division Before they were lots more riskaverse Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them Records show that the shared savings at SDGE a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gasfired electricitygenerating plants He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year In an annual report to the PUC in February PGE said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer advocacy group said it will closely watch the PUCs evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co We want to make sure given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said Well look to see whether the mechanism should be changed Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter longterm contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market Unfortunately under the system he said the only incentive is to beat the spot market Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section See attached file Dow Jones

Wednesday March Energy Insight Embedded image moved to file picpcx By Dave Todd US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising energy prices Delivering the keynote address at the US Chamber of Commerces national energy summit in Washington Monday Abraham said California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians Not very says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels managing director of Bostonbased METIS Trading Advisors Krapels a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities such as Consolidated Edison design markethedging programs adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the countrys economy in respect to energy security management First of all New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California he said California has hydro nuclear and gas but when it lost a lot of hydro the state needed gas to pick up the slack and the capacity just wasnt there In New Yorks case the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than Californias Krapels added New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning Californias marketplace New Yorks Independent System Operator ISO in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining instate generation capacity reserve margins and a strategy must be put in place whether or not new generation comes online in accordance with current anticipated scenarios A measure of New Yorks essential difficulty is that between and statewide demand for electricity grew MW while generating capacity expanded by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved the gap is expected to continue to widen To avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the states daily generating capacity needs to grow by MW by with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear the ISO wants to see a stateappointed ombudsman named to help wouldbe merchant power plant investors plow through red tape Increasing New Yorks generating capacity will also lessen the states escalating and risky reliance on outofstate sources of electricity the ISO added Since New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from instate sources Not everyone agrees with that analysis insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down interjurisdictional barriers In any case New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the US Northeast such as PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool are in vastly better shape in terms of crossborder cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market In California by contrast the states focusfor example in the case of new gasfired power plant developmenthas been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone rather than on a regional marketplace Embedded image moved to file picpcx The New York ISOs new broadbased analysis of marketrestructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New Yorks utilities to enter into longterm power contracts What needs to be done most it says is to move aggressively to build some of the more than MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline In the meantime the MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldnt be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early longrange weather forecasts Demand however is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to So while New York City the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year it could be a brief rest from the fray Meanwhile a shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan on Long Island and even on barges offshore One way or another whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities its going to be a hot time in the city Longterm solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile attempts at longerterm solutions continue to run into trouble Last week Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that HydroQuebec subsidiary TransEnergie US Ltd wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authoritys load pocket Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound the proposal failed to convince authorities who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut In similar fashion private companies wanting to build small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizationssome of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany The David vs Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good But suddenly in New York Californias troubleswhile still distant in their intensity may not be so far away By some estimates this summers bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last years charges Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isnt going to make the pain go away NEW YORK NYISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES NYISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NYISO said in a recent report Power Alert New Yorks Energy Crossroads New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NYISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report This report is essentially a caution light at New Yorks energy crossroads Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NYISOs warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline In a related development the NYISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NYISOs socalled temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse The NYISO Report The NYISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply The NYISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NYISO said this gap will continue to widen The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New Yorks power consumers The NYISOs modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs Besides large rate increases the NYISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on outofstate resources The report said that if no new instate generation comes on line in the next five years the states generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by Pointing to Californias situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities To avoid these harsh consequences the NYISO said New Yorks new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built The problem according to the NYISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made The NYISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gasfired units On a more positive note the NYISO reported that New Yorks restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter longterm power contracts The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial The report also recommended accelerating conservation realtime metering and pricesensitive load programs and upgrading the states and the Northeasts transmission infrastructure The Proposed Tariff Amendments New Yorks Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NYISOs request to extend from until its MWh bid caps FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them The NYISOs board is sensitive to the Commissions concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related Nevertheless the NYISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York states Article X process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth Moreover although the NYISO proposes to implement several demandside measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently priceresponsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demandside response Thus the NYISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NYISOs proposed demandside response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces Other problems cited in the NYISOs filing which keep New Yorks power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the states CentralEast interface and questions over adequate gas supply The NYISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued Nevertheless the NYISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJMs markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NYISOs bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets The NYISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high runups in prices The NYISOs request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through cited similar problems with New Yorks power markets but claimed that the NYISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws The TEPs were and remain an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NYISO and the Commission intended the filing insisted MASSACHUSETTS Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOSTON AP The states top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see Californiatype electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press Our major problem will come this summer State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California and on Monday California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in to attract more companies to stir competition But that hasnt happened yet largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition said Reilly a Democrat That competition in the wholesale market is not happening Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the regions power A spokeswoman for the regions power grid said electricity use is expected to rise to percent this year but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past months The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand said Ellen Foley spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc which manages the grid of generators connected by miles of high voltage transmission lines Still a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity a situation that arose once last summer Foley said In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation Those customers typically pay more than longterm customers Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into twoyear contracts with suppliers instead of the sixmonth contracts many have now to avoid shortterm price spikes for consumers Reilly said The Attorney Generals Office acts as an advocate for consumers Michael Monahan a spokesman for NSTAR which provides electricity to more than million customers is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod but currently has no lines under construction I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that its something we have to focus on Monahan said but he added The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity Californias statewide outages

Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CARSON CITY Nev AP Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid Californiastyle energy problems The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure its constitutional said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend RReno And thats not as easy as it sounds Townsends comment just before his committee began working on SB was prophetic witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure Translation Dont kill all deals by stopping Renobased Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegasbased Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June and possibly until Pete Ernaut a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before a deal that would be in the publics interest If you put a twoyear moratorium on these plants all these deals are going to go away he said When the cow leaves the barn its difficult to catch Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB on Monday Now its up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee Reliant isnt the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive Earlier this month executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that its in the publics interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant The Harry Allen plant produces about megawatts out of the megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate Pinnacle has plans to expand that to megawatts by Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts dont have to be included in SB Townsend said Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills but the power plant sale issue must be handled now Nevadas PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies merger in under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the states electricity and if theyre sold the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from billion to billion by July if the power plant sales are stopped Nevadas Consumer Advocates Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of million in savings MAINE Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved AUGUSTA Maine AP In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state Maines top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis A panel of industry insiders elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anticompetitive activities In addition the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maines deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity improve conservation and spur competition The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state Maines deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls said Rep William Savage DBuxton House chairman of the Legislatures Utilities Committee Maines law does not cap consumer prices as Californias does and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the states energy needs Savage said Since Maines deregulation law took effect in March Bangor HydroElectric Co rates have increased percent The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers peak load Gov Angus King and all four members of Maines congressional delegation oppose the hike The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co to mediumsized and large industrial users On the other hand some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market In the meantime legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maines deregulated energy industry One would use some of the money from the sale of powergenerating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users said Sen Norman Ferguson RHanover Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maines deregulation law but if it needs fixing it could be done during next years session The lawmakers primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead House Speaker Michael Saxl DPortland said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure ratepayers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes Michaud DEast Millinocket said hes interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern western and eastern Maine Michaud added The commission would include House and Senate members from each party a utility executive and representatives of energy producers providers a large commercial consumer and individual consumers OREGON State Senate moves to combat energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALEM Ore AP In an attempt to avoid a Californialike energy crisis the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources Its important for Oregon It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone said Sen Lee Beyer DSpringfield The measure SB would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources like wind from a year and a half to a matter of months The speededup process would be in effect for two years If we can act now we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer said Sen Jason Atkinson RJacksonville Californias strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note Beyer said though California was definitely a wakeup call the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest With low rainfall hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand Beyer said Gasfired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown DPortland Conservationists however caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards WISCONSIN Two utilities to add megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved Plans of two state utilities to add megawatts to Wisconsins electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to Californias were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding said Steve Hiniker executive director of the Citizens Utility Board which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers Alliant Energy Corp announced its proposal Wednesday in a filing with the state Public Service Commission to spend billion to build one coal and two gasfired power plants Alliant has proposed building a megawatt coalfired plant and a megawatt naturalgas fired plant by It also wants to build a megawatt natural gasfired facility in Wisconsin has not built a coalfired plant in more than two decades Alliant has not determined the plants locations Also Madison Gas Electric the states smallest investorowned utility said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois Three out of the four past summers weve had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state We need to take steps to avoid that and the California situation makes that even more clear said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases but it was too early to say how much rates would go up Californias problems which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II stemmed from underestimating the states power needs forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure longterm supply contracts and freezing rates among other things But Wisconsins situation is far different The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional megawatts of power over the next decade Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added In addition coalgenerated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state We dont have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past said Hiniker This is something the PSC should be doing MGEs deals are A year contract to buy megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May The power will come from the natural gasfired plant Rock River Energy Center near Beloit Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose Califbased Calpine Energy Corp The plant is being built by Northbrook Illbased SkyGen Energy LLC which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp A year contract to buy megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp starting in May The power is coming from a natural gasfired plant near Joliet Ill owned by LS Power Co Rainy River is a unit of Duluthbased Minnesota Power Inc A fiveyear contract to buy megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova Ill in western Illinois The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co which is a unit of Iowabased MidAmerican

nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace

February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings

sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag

is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in

no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as

advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone the October sale of the three gencos two of the three prequalified companies failed to submit final bids Also the political opposition has challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme Court Panama Privatization of governmentheld IRHE is now complete of distribution and generation was sold in The government plans to retain control of transmission Foreign investors are involved in

MW Andean hydro complex Mantaro It was not clear what form privatization would take nor is it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and fled Peru also announced bids for construction and operation of two transmission lines Currently only large industrials representing of the market have choice There are no plans to expand this Trinidad and Tobago While there has been a partial unbundling of the generation arm of TTEC the government utility retains control of TD as well as of all of natural gas purchases There been neither much IPP nor privatization activity since the sale of of TTEC to Southern and BP Amoco in and the financing of one IPP in Venezuela The Chavez government imposed an electricity restructuring law in August Industrials can choose their supplier but there are no plans to open the market completely A wholesale market is proposed for Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere due to high subsidization While the government dithered on privatization plans AES jumped in with a surprise bid for the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas The government recently announced a tentative sale date of early for of two regional electric companies Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links

Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The

electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace

the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market

monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent

Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan

requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint

no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project

interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer

passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool

Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a

monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices

fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to

significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets

Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links

won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated

is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates

for internal purposes Would you find it helpful to be on the distribution list Hope you are doing well Look forward to touching base soon Forwarded by Suzanne NimocksHOUNorthAmericaMCKINSEY on AM Memorandum TO Pru Sheppard BCC Suzanne Nimocks FROM Pru Sheppard B Venki Venkateshwara DATE March California Power Crisis Update No DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK The weeks highlights include Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn Jeff Gerths story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multiyear investigation of Bill Clinton The key issues are familiar Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps refunds and so on If so what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than cents on the dollar The California ISO filed a complaint claiming billion in overcharges this week The QF irony Through the s QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market In recent months in California they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output But credit problems have created an ironical situation The facts PGE and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PGE and Edison into bankruptcy Some gasfired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas Last weeks court decision allows MidAmericanCalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility CalEnergy does so immediately selling to El Paso The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO when requested regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO Reliant announced it will appeal the order This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the situations are probably different The QF contracts predate the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies In fact many QF contracts have the opposite provision authority for the utility to cut takes during socalled light load periods Stage emergency and rolling blackoutsagain There was another Stage emergency in California with rolling blackouts this week This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March Among the factors Increased demand from summerlike temperatures Cutbacks in imports Loss of MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant Loss of about MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits An internal memorandum laid out two choices The agency could audit and punish bad actors the companies that were exploiting the market Or it could identify bad hours when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobodys fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors the memorandum said The commission took the easier way It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few bad hours in January and February That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during good hours when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme The order ignored those hours Today in a criticism of the agencys lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies But the agencys track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely softpedaled its role as the electricity industrys top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials The agencys defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely handsoff approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say Californias rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits The agencys critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by freemarket passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was insufficient data in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies Yet his own former employer PGE Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the midAtlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics The agencys inaction the critics say leads to gaming jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track Were trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers Mr Hebert said Fight Over Deregulation Todays debate traces back to the s when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years Two Republican seats are currently unfilled The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late s after the agency had begun opening the gas markets By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the midAtlantic states Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market But the agencys balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AYbear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions Mr Hebert said high prices in California were sending the right signals to get supply there Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging unlawful and said that his agency by not reining them in is simply not doing its job The agencys leadership has been in flux for months Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports Though Mr Heberts positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically freemarket position of any commissioner He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces When Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies debt Mr Heberts response was dismissive Its not in the interest of the American public he pronounced Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks The midAtlantic region experienced some early volatility As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called market power the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the midAtlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate The decision roiled some agency officials Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring LocalFederal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much The industry not surprisingly shares that view One vocal critic was Mr Miller Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energytrading unit of PGE Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during Californias crisis Mr Millers former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide PGE Energy Trading by several estimates is now the secondlargest seller of electricity in New England The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PGE and other companies Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged very high prices when it could One persons predatory pricing is another persons competitive advantage Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in New England regulators too often acted as judge jury and executioner when overseeing the market he said One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New Englands problems from the regulators perspective Their Nov report attributed New Englands frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws As Mr Millers team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agencys began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New Englands ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said They said the department was examining whether PGE and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year PGE confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the departments requests Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PGE or at the agency His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PGE and his duties at the agency Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agencys San Francisco office One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show Daniel Larcamp Mr Millers supervisor said there might have been more information that could have been obtained in the California inquiry But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so timeconsuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PGE The lawyers said Mr Millers participation had been permissible because PGE was not the subject of the investigation When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market But while the companies had the potential to exercise market power the commission said there was insufficient data to prove that they did Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices When the agencys own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a lastminute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a timeconsuming investigation During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal misbehavior by sellers bad actors always seems to fail his memorandum said It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours The suggestion won the day The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several privatesector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons Because most highpriced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as just and reasonable the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis The problem with my agency is that were so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that weve gotten sloppy Mr Massey said Were talking about electricity Its the juice of the economy so its got to be available and reasonably priced Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved TULSA Okla AP Williams Cos Inc says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold overpriced electricity to California Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co a unit of Tulsabased Williams owes California more than million in refunds for power it sold to the states Independent System Operator The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for million in overcharges from transactions in January and February The Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid claims the state was overcharged billion by wholesale power providers including Williams between May and February Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO According to the commission power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions However the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams power prices Collins said The commission will review Williams explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds Allegheny

provide more natural gas for generating plants in California Williams gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line Construction on the billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May said Kirk Morgan director of business development for Kern River pipeline Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin where producers are aggressively stepping up production Morgan said The new pipeline is expected to deliver about million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah Nevada and California Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California If all of the pipelines capacity were used to generate electricity it could produce about megawatts That is enough to light around million homes Morgan said The original Kern River line was completed in It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield Calif It currently transports million cubic feet of natural gas per day Williams based in Tulsa Okla recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by million cubic feet per day That million pumping station project should be completed by July During the construction period the Kern River project will employ between and people The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from million to about million Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline Morgan said The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities including St George and Cedar City Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full

Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Some of CalEnergy Operating Corps power could end up being sold outside of California though that is not the companys intent CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday CalEnergy an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co which is majority owned by Warren Buffetts BerkshireHathaway BRKA was given legal authority Thursday to suspend megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling We stopped supplying power at PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since thenWe are selling it to marketers our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us Sokol said Sokol added that while it was his companys intention to have its power sold to California that could not be guaranteed We leave the energy selling to El PasoWeve directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we cant stop them from selling out of state Sokol said Wholesale prices on the open market are about a megawatthour three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed The courts ruling did not address the million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power and Sokol said that his companys separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utilitys assets as payment for that debt Sokol said the courts ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small independent generators known as qualifying facilities or QFs who have not received payment from SoCal Ed Edisons own lawyer said it bestthat every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market Sokol said Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadnt won the case but said he couldnt speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome A group of renewable power suppliers owed more than million from SoCal Ed said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability The utilities claim close to billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze In a statement SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergys bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergys request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors While many of the states large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California the QFs which make up onethird of the states total power supply havent been paid by SoCal Ed since November PGE has made partial payments to its QFs By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold contributed to this article California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO Californias balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison allowing it to sell power on the open market The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the states financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas Electric which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small alternative energy producerswhich together provide nearly a third of the states powerget paid But Assembly Republicans opposed it saying it hadnt been given sufficient scrutiny The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County where Edisons failure to pay CalEnergy the countys biggest property taxpayer had outsize implications CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a million property tax payment The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokols first acts after the judges ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time That is great news Leimgruber said Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market Some of the more than other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas Electric We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gasfired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a creditworthy company that in fact pays for the power An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because Californias power crisis has placed them in financial distress just as it has placed utilities in financial distress Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we cant stop them Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy million and that the companyalong with seven other small producershad been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy He said his company no longer intends to do so and he believedbut wasnt certainthat the other companies would shelve their plans Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed million to various small electricity producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam solar energy or wind The alternative energy producersand utilitiesstrenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday The bill spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the Senate on a vote the exact twothirds margin required But it stalled in the Assembly on a partyline vote well short of twothirds When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster said Thats exactly what we have before us The alternative electricity generators including oil companies warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal while representatives of Edison and PGE which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole There isnt enough money Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday It is a very simple question Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in The bill AB X combined several proposals First it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PGE must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying Additionally the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity Wind solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration But most of the alternative energy producers including Chevron and British Petroleum use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat With natural gas prices high they contend they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering Ellingwood reported from El Centro Morain from Sacramento Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at billion up from the billion first thought Californias power grid operator said Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that CalISOs figures dont take into account all their costs A Superior Court judges ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid Verbatim If these guys have such high costs how come theyre making so much money Gary Stern Edisons director of market monitoring and analysis referring to power producers Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Californias electricgrid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by billion or a total of in a month period and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets Meanwhile a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energystarved state but likely at greater cost to the state government The billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO says it isnt seeking a refund for the May through February period because its analysis lacked important market data For example it estimated costs for suppliers based on published prices for natural gas not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel We dont know how much gas actually was purchased at spotmarket prices said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs head of market analysis Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO said FERC needs to become more aggressive about marketpower mitigation The ISOs filing he said was intended to push the agency in that direction since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and naturalgas markets He said that if the FERC doesnt act the state of California may find ways to discipline the market such as through the state attorney generals office The attorney general has been investigating the states electricity market for many months but hasnt brought any court action Dynegy Inc a big owner of power plants in California said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable The Houston company was one of energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling million or show cause why it should be excused Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern Californias Imperial County A judge granted geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc of Omaha Neb permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co and instead seek other buyers These plants known as qualifying facilities are under longterm contract to Edison and other utilities but havent been paid for months Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the states failed utilityderegulation plan While the CalEnergy case involves only about megawatts of power the repercussions could be far greater Collectively hundreds of qualifying facilities or QFs produce as much as of Californias electricity needs QFs totaling megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market presumably to the state government that now is Californias biggest energy buyer An hour after the court decision yesterday some megawatts of power came back into the market the ISO said However additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the states tab Already the state has allocated more than billion for electricity purchases Separately Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a writeoff of as much as billion for Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis the company hasnt yet reported yearend earnings Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals regardless of size from rolling blackouts The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investorowned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than hospitals throughout the state Under PUC rules hospitals with more than beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies But during rolling blackouts Monday at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers Linda Ziegler director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them But hospitals say there is a second lapse before emergency generators kick in which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery You wouldnt fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place said Ann Mosher a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco Backup generators are just that theyre not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis from incidents like lightning or a knockeddown power pole If its a serious problem for the hospital its certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis she said The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the states investor owned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are separately regulated For more than two decades prisons hospitals with more than beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services and are exempted from

comment on the ruling The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired The judge then issued a temporary restraining order requiring the sales but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling The ISO said it would lose about megawatts if the suppliers pulled out enough power for about million households One megawatt is enough for roughly homes Grid officials said Reliants share alone is about megawatts Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that because most of its output is already committed under longterm contracts Reliant which currently provides about of the states power worries it wont get paid due to the financial troubles of PGE and Edison PGE and

Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Many of Californias independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the states three investorowned utilities At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the states Public Utilities Code which links the socalled qualifying facilities electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas Lawmakers however are poised to pass the legislation State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric from a megawatthour to MWh regardless of the price of natural gas Whereas each of the QF contracts differed largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities The cogeneration facilities which produce about megawatts of electricity in the state said the rates are too low and they wont sign new supply contracts with the utilities For MWh natural gas would have to be per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border said Tom Lu executive director of Carsonbased Watson Cogeneration Company the states largest QF generating MW Our current gas price at the border is Other gasfired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week Lu whose company is halfowned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed million by SoCal Ed said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse David Fogarty spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association whose members supply California with more than MW said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than billion for electricity that was already produced State Loses MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about onethird or MW of the states total power supply Roughly MW are produced by natural gasfired facilities The rest is generated by wind solar power and biomass About MW of gasfired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners havent been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cashstrapped utilities SoCal Ed and PGE for nearly four months Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates The defaults have left many of the renewable and gasfired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they cant afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the states utilities but arent being paid even on a forward basis The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electricity grid said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday Gov Gray Davis recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of MWh and MWh for five and year contracts He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward After next week the QF problem will be behind us Davis said Tuesday We want to get the QFs paidthe QFs are dropping like fliesand when that happens the lights go out But this just makes the problem worse said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter a member of the Assembly energy committee I dont know how we are going to keep the lights on Florez said in an interview Many of these congenerators are in my district They said if the legislation doesnt change they are going offline This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts especially now when we need every megawatt Davis who didnt meet with people representing the QFs said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a fiveyear price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities In addition SOCal Ed opposed the legislation saying the rates should be below MWh Some renewable power producers said they arent vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities said his group of gasfired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said Hal Dittmer president of Sacramentobased Wellhead Electric in Sacramento which is owed million by PGE has MW of gasfired generation units offline Under the states plan Dittmer said he risks going out of business I cant buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision he said

MORAIN JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market After two days of statewide blackouts power plants that had been shut down were cranked up Unseasonable heat tapered off The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency But plenty of ominous signs remained Many small producers remained shut down skeptical about Gov Gray Davis plan for utilities to pay them State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the states foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only megawatts of electricity significantly less than the to megawatts previously claimed While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons including the states failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July The Legislature has approved plans to sell billion in bonds but none have yet been issued We are exposed enormously this summer Senate Energy Committee chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey said after looking at the report We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be We

California was forced to start buying electricity in Decemberat a cost of million a daybecause producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators said the report represents a work in progress He said the state may yet sign new contracts However Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to realtime meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand The head of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs He said the state needs to take over the utilities contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business and sign new contracts for megawatts of new wind powerthe cheapest fastest and cleanest source of new supply Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers some of which have not been paid since November But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal sources But most of them generate power using natural gasand the cost of natural gas has been soaring Several natural gas users said Davis plan which caps rates wont cover their fuel costs Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall But small generators say they dont have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis proposal next week It offers producers two choices cents a kilowatthour if they agree to supply power for five years or cents a kilowatthour over years The price of natural gas is higher than that said Marty Quinn executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Any order from the California Public Utilities Commission requiring utilities to pay small independent generators going forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate structure a spokesman for Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison said Wednesday The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require utilities to pay small generators called qualifying facilities a megawatt hour within days of electricity delivery The decision will be voted March by the CPUC Were still reviewing the decision and should have more to say in a day or two To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs a SoCal Edison spokesman said SoCal Edison and PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co are struggling under nearly billion in uncollected power costs due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze Gov Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December Pacific Gas Electric Co has made some partial payments to QFs but SoCal Edison has paid nothing Together they owe the QFs about billion but the order doesnt address that debt An Edison executive said in reaction to the governors sharp comments that the company simply doesnt have the money to pay creditors The root problem here is there just isnt enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster We understand the financial distress the QFs face we are facing financial distress ourselves The proposed PUC order would also require the states investorowned utilities to offer the small generators five and year contracts for power for MWh and MWh respectively The QFs may be able to live with the PUC proposal but the five and year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the California borders are high said Jan SmutnyJones president of the Independent Energy Producers Association Natural gas prices into California are currently higher than anywhere in the country But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money they are still owed

agreement with heavily indebted PGE has a way to go RONE TEMPEST DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday a key consultant to Gov Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the states largest utilities are proceeding at an accelerated pace Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days although those with PGE are much less advanced The administration and PGE have not reached even an agreement in principle he said PGE which has more debt than Edison says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart The state wants to buy the utilities transmission lines and other assets for about billion to provide cash to the utilities help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months To research the grid purchase Fichera said the state has had to pore over documents just to assess the utilities liabilities We are working at a good pace said Fichera chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners If we get to a dealbreaker it might be longer By making Fichera who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission available to reporters Tuesday the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governors plan to pull the state out of the crisis Since midJanuary when the big utilities credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them the state has spent nearly billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas Oklahoma Georgia and North Carolina Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the states electricity The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cashstrapped alternative suppliers including solar biomass and wind power units cut their normal supply to the system in half They say Edison and PGE have not paid them since November the utilities say they are out of cash Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost individual contractors Another delaying factor said Keeley who with state Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers prices was the huge enmity manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities These people just dont like each other This weeks blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration When it comes to electricity size doesnt matterevery kilowatt counts During peak use a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts There is no such thing as a partial solution Unless the whole energy equation is balanced the parts dont work For the Davis plan to work several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the already set in motion The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through longterm contracts with the big outofstate producers These contracts the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group The administration says it has concluded contracts with generators about half of which have been signed According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned billion bond offering to succeed The bonds set for sale in May will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity The state is currently spending at a rate of million a day to buy power If prices stay high the billion in bonds will not cover the states power purchases by the end of the summer Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment Angelides has estimated that under the January law that put the state in the power buying business the state must be reimbursed billion annually and that billion is needed to service the debt PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers known as qualifying facilities must be cut at least in half down from an average of more than cents per kilowatthour In his news conference Tuesday Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at cents for year contracts and cents for fiveyear contracts Meanwhile PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid Lynch said The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they havent been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation said John Nelson a spokesman for PGE The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves mainly from hydro and nuclear sources at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the nearbankrupt utilities to solvency Times staff writers Julie Tamaki Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog As part of secret deal to get longterm energy contracts state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions Critics renew call for full disclosure DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As part of his closeddoor negotiations to buy electricity Gov Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air Davis said Tuesday Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with generators to supply billion worth of power during the next years However the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms contending that release of such information would hamper the states ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity Sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc a power company based in Houston is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the companys deal with the state We couldnt get them to sign contracts it was a sticking point Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM Under the system companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution If their operations pollute more companies are required to purchase credits on an open market Currently the credits cost about per pound of pollutionan amount that can lead to a bill of well over million a year for a power plant The South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the systema step that could considerably cut the states potential cost Davis said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power companys costs It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power she said If it brings down the price of power I dont have a problem with it Nevertheless word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts the critics note The Legislature should have known about it said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco It is going to cost taxpayers money It makes you wonder This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature V John White a lobbyist for the Sierra Club who also represents alternative energy producers called the contract proposal a horrible precedent Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents we cant determine how serious the breach of principle this is White said Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations Terry Francke general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light In the summer when demand for power is highest some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts To avert blackouts state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running In such cases some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any finesalthough Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollutionrelated measures The company which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County said its aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment rose to million in from million in A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegys facilities appear to be fairly cleanalthough Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil which is dirtier than natural gas Davis said he intends to make this information public but he added that we do not want to put the publics interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices Nobody likes the notion that the administration is not being fully forthcoming Davis said But I also have a corollary responsibility that I dont stick these generators with a higher rate FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Following a preliminary nonpublic investigation FERC directed AES Southland Inc and Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co IN on March to show cause why they did not violate section of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability mustrun RMR generator units during a period in April and May The investigation responded to a matter referred by the CalISO If a violation is found Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their marketbased rate authority for a year The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission The CalISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network The CalISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR units availability and a variable payment for the RMR units output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market Williams Energy and the CalISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the CalISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intrazonal congestion The ISO may dispatch a nonRMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available Under its RMR agreement with the ISO Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units However if a nonRMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable Williams will be paid its bid price not the RMR contract price During the April to May period the CalISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos and Huntington Beach as RMR units to provide voltage support However according to the FERC order Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos available from April through May and to make Huntington Beach available from May through May for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units Consequently the CalISO was forced to dispatch nonRMR units at a higher cost namely Williams Energys bid price for service provided by the replacement units By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energys variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units output Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May The bid price for the nonRMR units was at or near the CalISOs theneffective bid cap of MWh FERC continued Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the CalISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the nonRMR units approximately MWh during the period in question This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million The information in this order and a nonpublic appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons Based on this information coupled with Williams Energys financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the CalISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its marketbased rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the CalISOs tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue and whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations a refund by Williams Energy andor AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available and a condition on Williams Energys marketbased rate authority Specifically for a oneyear period if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the CalISO a nonRMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract In other words Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute non RMR unit The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the abovedescribed violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed Further to ensure procurement of all relevant information the Commission instituted a formal nonpublic investigation into the operation maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in and Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California consumers havent been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts consumers arent using less electricity which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid As a result blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities the ISO said ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option but consumers in the state arent heeding the call to reduce consumption Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan and Jan when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints Jim Detmers the ISOs vice president of operation said consumers saved the state about megawatts of electricity enough power for million houses The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about MW or less We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time Detmers said The states Energy Commission said consumers think its no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed People have been saving generally but it isnt a big bump from hour to hour a spokesman for the Energy Commission said Gov Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least of electricity compared with last summer The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Gas Cos Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs Though consumers get a share of the windfall regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus which is expected to be huge this year as a form of price relief The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co Through vigorous deal making the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down For several years the utility has been splitting the savings with ratepayers whenever the companys gas costs fall slightly below market levels Those savings Gas Co executives acknowledged have shot to unprecedented heights during the states power crisis Now in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices regulators are taking another look at the program The question before the Public Utilities Commission Should Gas Co ratepayers who endured huge bill increases this winter get a bigger share of the savings The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded million But the amount for the last months is expected to multiply many times over company executives said partly because the Gas Co has done so well in the wild market by selling lending and trading gas as well as buying it The recent market conditions could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers the PUCs consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates reported Oct even before the latest upward market spirals Gas Co representatives express frustration saying they have done what the state has requested under its gascost incentive program Buy smarter and pass the savings along to its million residential and smallbusiness customers The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost The PUC every time we do well raises the bar on us said Jim Harrigan director of gas acquisition I dont necessarily agree with it By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity the Gas Co has become a big player in the regional natural gas market In the companys bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters employees track price movements pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along Californias border where prices have rocketed The PUC created the cost incentive program for the states three major gas utilitiesSan Diego Gas Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co in Like Southern California Gas SDGE is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Cos trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings Californias gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers monthly gas bills but are not itemized At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed Theres no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the companys award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from belowmarket gas and transportation costs In the early years of the program records show the Gas Cos awards went from zero to million million million and million Last years award of million is awaiting PUC approval This years proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was wellequipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said Harrigan said however that he does not believe the companys level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this years incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June I dont want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the companys award I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers It has been immense Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities The companys gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet Thats more than twice last years cost but only about half what sister company SDGE paid for its customers in February Its also much lower than the per therm PGE pays We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needsabout to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier This presents opportunities At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border With gas price runups like those seen in the last year Pocta said there is a question Should that benefit be shared or flow entirely to ratepayers Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals By the same token we want the Gas Co to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added We want them to have incentives The question is how to balance them Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January The company makes gas sales at various locations It engages in exchanges It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division Before they were lots more riskaverse Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them Records show that the shared savings at SDGE a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gasfired electricitygenerating plants He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year In an annual report to the PUC in February PGE said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer advocacy group said it will closely watch the PUCs evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co We want to make sure given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said Well look to see whether the mechanism should be changed Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter longterm contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market Unfortunately under the system he said the only incentive is to beat the spot market Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section See attached file Dow Jones

Wednesday March Energy Insight Embedded image moved to file picpcx By Dave Todd US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising energy prices Delivering the keynote address at the US Chamber of Commerces national energy summit in Washington Monday Abraham said California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians Not very says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels managing director of Bostonbased METIS Trading Advisors Krapels a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities such as Consolidated Edison design markethedging programs adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the countrys economy in respect to energy security management First of all New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California he said California has hydro nuclear and gas but when it lost a lot of hydro the state needed gas to pick up the slack and the capacity just wasnt there In New Yorks case the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than Californias Krapels added New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning Californias marketplace New Yorks Independent System Operator ISO in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining instate generation capacity reserve margins and a strategy must be put in place whether or not new generation comes online in accordance with current anticipated scenarios A measure of New Yorks essential difficulty is that between and statewide demand for electricity grew MW while generating capacity expanded by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved the gap is expected to continue to widen To avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the states daily generating capacity needs to grow by MW by with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear the ISO wants to see a stateappointed ombudsman named to help wouldbe merchant power plant investors plow through red tape Increasing New Yorks generating capacity will also lessen the states escalating and risky reliance on outofstate sources of electricity the ISO added Since New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from instate sources Not everyone agrees with that analysis insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down interjurisdictional barriers In any case New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the US Northeast such as PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool are in vastly better shape in terms of crossborder cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market In California by contrast the states focusfor example in the case of new gasfired power plant developmenthas been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone rather than on a regional marketplace Embedded image moved to file picpcx The New York ISOs new broadbased analysis of marketrestructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New Yorks utilities to enter into longterm power contracts What needs to be done most it says is to move aggressively to build some of the more than MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline In the meantime the MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldnt be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early longrange weather forecasts Demand however is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to So while New York City the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year it could be a brief rest from the fray Meanwhile a shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan on Long Island and even on barges offshore One way or another whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities its going to be a hot time in the city Longterm solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile attempts at longerterm solutions continue to run into trouble Last week Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that HydroQuebec subsidiary TransEnergie US Ltd wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authoritys load pocket Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound the proposal failed to convince authorities who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut In similar fashion private companies wanting to build small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizationssome of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany The David vs Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good But suddenly in New York Californias troubleswhile still distant in their intensity may not be so far away By some estimates this summers bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last years charges Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isnt going to make the pain go away NEW YORK NYISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES NYISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NYISO said in a recent report Power Alert New Yorks Energy Crossroads New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NYISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report This report is essentially a caution light at New Yorks energy crossroads Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NYISOs warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline In a related development the NYISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NYISOs socalled temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse The NYISO Report The NYISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply The NYISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NYISO said this gap will continue to widen The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New Yorks power consumers The NYISOs modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs Besides large rate increases the NYISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on outofstate resources The report said that if no new instate generation comes on line in the next five years the states generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by Pointing to Californias situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities To avoid these harsh consequences the NYISO said New Yorks new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built The problem according to the NYISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made The NYISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gasfired units On a more positive note the NYISO reported that New Yorks restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter longterm power contracts The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial The report also recommended accelerating conservation realtime metering and pricesensitive load programs and upgrading the states and the Northeasts transmission infrastructure The Proposed Tariff Amendments New Yorks Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NYISOs request to extend from until its MWh bid caps FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them The NYISOs board is sensitive to the Commissions concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related Nevertheless the NYISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York states Article X process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth Moreover although the NYISO proposes to implement several demandside measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently priceresponsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demandside response Thus the NYISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NYISOs proposed demandside response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces Other problems cited in the NYISOs filing which keep New Yorks power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the states CentralEast interface and questions over adequate gas supply The NYISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued Nevertheless the NYISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJMs markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NYISOs bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets The NYISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high runups in prices The NYISOs request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through cited similar problems with New Yorks power markets but claimed that the NYISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws The TEPs were and remain an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NYISO and the Commission intended the filing insisted MASSACHUSETTS Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOSTON AP The states top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see Californiatype electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press Our major problem will come this summer State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California and on Monday California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in to attract more companies to stir competition But that hasnt happened yet largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition said Reilly a Democrat That competition in the wholesale market is not happening Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the regions power A spokeswoman for the regions power grid said electricity use is expected to rise to percent this year but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past months The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand said Ellen Foley spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc which manages the grid of generators connected by miles of high voltage transmission lines Still a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity a situation that arose once last summer Foley said In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation Those customers typically pay more than longterm customers Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into twoyear contracts with suppliers instead of the sixmonth contracts many have now to avoid shortterm price spikes for consumers Reilly said The Attorney Generals Office acts as an advocate for consumers Michael Monahan a spokesman for NSTAR which provides electricity to more than million customers is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod but currently has no lines under construction I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that its something we have to focus on Monahan said but he added The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity Californias statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero California partially deregulated its electric industry in two years before Massachusetts On the Net Attorney Generals Office NSTAR ISO New England Inc NEVADA Discussion of bill stopping power plant sales to continue Wednesday By JOHN WILKERSON Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CARSON CITY Nev AP Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid Californiastyle energy problems The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure its constitutional said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend RReno And thats not as easy as it sounds Townsends comment just before his committee began working on SB was prophetic witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure Translation Dont kill all deals by stopping Renobased Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegasbased Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June and possibly until Pete Ernaut a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before a deal that would be in the publics interest If you put a twoyear moratorium on these plants all these deals are going to go away he said When the cow leaves the barn its difficult to catch Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB on Monday Now its up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee Reliant isnt the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive Earlier this month executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that its in the publics interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant The Harry Allen plant produces about megawatts out of the megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate Pinnacle has plans to expand that to megawatts by Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts dont have to be included in SB Townsend said Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills but the power plant sale issue must be handled now Nevadas PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies merger in under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the states electricity and if theyre sold the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from billion to billion by July if the power plant sales are stopped Nevadas Consumer Advocates Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of million in savings MAINE Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved AUGUSTA Maine AP In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state Maines top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis A panel of industry insiders elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anticompetitive activities In addition the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maines deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity improve conservation and spur competition The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state Maines deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls said Rep William Savage DBuxton House chairman of the Legislatures Utilities Committee Maines law does not cap consumer prices as Californias does and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the states energy needs Savage said Since Maines deregulation law took effect in March Bangor HydroElectric Co rates have increased percent The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers peak load Gov Angus King and all four members of Maines congressional delegation oppose the hike The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co to mediumsized and large industrial users On the other hand some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market In the meantime legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maines deregulated energy industry One would use some of the money from the sale of powergenerating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users said Sen Norman Ferguson RHanover Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maines deregulation law but if it needs fixing it could be done during next years session The lawmakers primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead House Speaker Michael Saxl DPortland said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure ratepayers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes Michaud DEast Millinocket said hes interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern western and eastern Maine Michaud added The commission would include House and Senate members from each party a utility executive and representatives of energy producers providers a large commercial consumer and individual consumers OREGON State Senate moves to combat energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALEM Ore AP In an attempt to avoid a Californialike energy crisis the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources Its important for Oregon It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone said Sen Lee Beyer DSpringfield The measure SB would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources like wind from a year and a half to a matter of months The speededup process would be in effect for two years If we can act now we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer said Sen Jason Atkinson RJacksonville Californias strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note Beyer said though California was definitely a wakeup call the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest With low rainfall hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand Beyer said Gasfired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown DPortland Conservationists however caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards WISCONSIN Two utilities to add megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved Plans of two state utilities to add megawatts to Wisconsins electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to Californias were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding said Steve Hiniker executive director of the Citizens Utility Board which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers Alliant Energy Corp announced its proposal Wednesday in a filing with the state Public Service Commission to spend billion to build one coal and two gasfired power plants Alliant has proposed building a megawatt coalfired plant and a megawatt naturalgas fired plant by It also wants to build a megawatt natural gasfired facility in Wisconsin has not built a coalfired plant in more than two decades Alliant has not determined the plants locations Also Madison Gas Electric the states smallest investorowned utility said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois Three out of the four past summers weve had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state We need to take steps to avoid that and the California situation makes that even more clear said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases but it was too early to say how much rates would go up Californias problems which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II stemmed from underestimating the states power needs forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure longterm supply contracts and freezing rates among other things But Wisconsins situation is far different The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional megawatts of power over the next decade Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added In addition coalgenerated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state We dont have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past said Hiniker This is something the PSC should be doing MGEs deals are A year contract to buy megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May The power will come from the natural gasfired plant Rock River Energy Center near Beloit Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose Califbased Calpine Energy Corp The plant is being built by Northbrook Illbased SkyGen Energy LLC which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp A year contract to buy megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp starting in May The power is coming from a natural gasfired plant near Joliet Ill owned by LS Power Co Rainy River is a unit of Duluthbased Minnesota Power Inc A fiveyear contract to buy megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova Ill in western Illinois The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co which is a unit of Iowabased MidAmerican

for internal purposes Would you find it helpful to be on the distribution list Hope you are doing well Look forward to touching base soon Forwarded by Suzanne NimocksHOUNorthAmericaMCKINSEY on AM Memorandum TO Pru Sheppard BCC Suzanne Nimocks FROM Pru Sheppard B Venki Venkateshwara DATE March California Power Crisis Update No DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK The weeks highlights include Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn Jeff Gerths story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multiyear investigation of Bill Clinton The key issues are familiar Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps refunds and so on If so what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than cents on the dollar The California ISO filed a complaint claiming billion in overcharges this week The QF irony Through the s QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market In recent months in California they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output But credit problems have created an ironical situation The facts PGE and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PGE and Edison into bankruptcy Some gasfired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas Last weeks court decision allows MidAmericanCalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility CalEnergy does so immediately selling to El Paso The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO when requested regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO Reliant announced it will appeal the order This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the situations are probably different The QF contracts predate the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies In fact many QF contracts have the opposite provision authority for the utility to cut takes during socalled light load periods Stage emergency and rolling blackoutsagain There was another Stage emergency in California with rolling blackouts this week This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March Among the factors Increased demand from summerlike temperatures Cutbacks in imports Loss of MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant Loss of about MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits An internal memorandum laid out two choices The agency could audit and punish bad actors the companies that were exploiting the market Or it could identify bad hours when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobodys fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors the memorandum said The commission took the easier way It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few bad hours in January and February That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during good hours when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme The order ignored those hours Today in a criticism of the agencys lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies But the agencys track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely softpedaled its role as the electricity industrys top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials The agencys defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely handsoff approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say Californias rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits The agencys critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by freemarket passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was insufficient data in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies Yet his own former employer PGE Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the midAtlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics The agencys inaction the critics say leads to gaming jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track Were trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers Mr Hebert said Fight Over Deregulation Todays debate traces back to the s when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years Two Republican seats are currently unfilled The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late s after the agency had begun opening the gas markets By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the midAtlantic states Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market But the agencys balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AYbear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions Mr Hebert said high prices in California were sending the right signals to get supply there Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging unlawful and said that his agency by not reining them in is simply not doing its job The agencys leadership has been in flux for months Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports Though Mr Heberts positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically freemarket position of any commissioner He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces When Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies debt Mr Heberts response was dismissive Its not in the interest of the American public he pronounced Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks The midAtlantic region experienced some early volatility As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called market power the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the midAtlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate The decision roiled some agency officials Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring LocalFederal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much The industry not surprisingly shares that view One vocal critic was Mr Miller Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energytrading unit of PGE Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during Californias crisis Mr Millers former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide PGE Energy Trading by several estimates is now the secondlargest seller of electricity in New England The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PGE and other companies Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged very high prices when it could One persons predatory pricing is another persons competitive advantage Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in New England regulators too often acted as judge jury and executioner when overseeing the market he said One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New Englands problems from the regulators perspective Their Nov report attributed New Englands frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws As Mr Millers team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agencys began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New Englands ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said They said the department was examining whether PGE and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year PGE confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the departments requests Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PGE or at the agency His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PGE and his duties at the agency Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agencys San Francisco office One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show Daniel Larcamp Mr Millers supervisor said there might have been more information that could have been obtained in the California inquiry But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so timeconsuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PGE The lawyers said Mr Millers participation had been permissible because PGE was not the subject of the investigation When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market But while the companies had the potential to exercise market power the commission said there was insufficient data to prove that they did Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices When the agencys own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a lastminute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a timeconsuming investigation During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal misbehavior by sellers bad actors always seems to fail his memorandum said It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours The suggestion won the day The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several privatesector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons Because most highpriced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as just and reasonable the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis The problem with my agency is that were so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that weve gotten sloppy Mr Massey said Were talking about electricity Its the juice of the economy so its got to be available and reasonably priced Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved TULSA Okla AP Williams Cos Inc says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold overpriced electricity to California Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co a unit of Tulsabased Williams owes California more than million in refunds for power it sold to the states Independent System Operator The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for million in overcharges from transactions in January and February The Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid claims the state was overcharged billion by wholesale power providers including Williams between May and February Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO According to the commission power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions However the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams power prices Collins said The commission will review Williams explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds Allegheny

provide more natural gas for generating plants in California Williams gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line Construction on the billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May said Kirk Morgan director of business development for Kern River pipeline Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin where producers are aggressively stepping up production Morgan said The new pipeline is expected to deliver about million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah Nevada and California Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California If all of the pipelines capacity were used to generate electricity it could produce about megawatts That is enough to light around million homes Morgan said The original Kern River line was completed in It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield Calif It currently transports million cubic feet of natural gas per day Williams based in Tulsa Okla recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by million cubic feet per day That million pumping station project should be completed by July During the construction period the Kern River project will employ between and people The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from million to about million Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline Morgan said The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities including St George and Cedar City Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full

Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Some of CalEnergy Operating Corps power could end up being sold outside of California though that is not the companys intent CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday CalEnergy an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co which is majority owned by Warren Buffetts BerkshireHathaway BRKA was given legal authority Thursday to suspend megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling We stopped supplying power at PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since thenWe are selling it to marketers our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us Sokol said Sokol added that while it was his companys intention to have its power sold to California that could not be guaranteed We leave the energy selling to El PasoWeve directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we cant stop them from selling out of state Sokol said Wholesale prices on the open market are about a megawatthour three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed The courts ruling did not address the million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power and Sokol said that his companys separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utilitys assets as payment for that debt Sokol said the courts ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small independent generators known as qualifying facilities or QFs who have not received payment from SoCal Ed Edisons own lawyer said it bestthat every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market Sokol said Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadnt won the case but said he couldnt speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome A group of renewable power suppliers owed more than million from SoCal Ed said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability The utilities claim close to billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze In a statement SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergys bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergys request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors While many of the states large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California the QFs which make up onethird of the states total power supply havent been paid by SoCal Ed since November PGE has made partial payments to its QFs By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold contributed to this article California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO Californias balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison allowing it to sell power on the open market The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the states financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas Electric which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small alternative energy producerswhich together provide nearly a third of the states powerget paid But Assembly Republicans opposed it saying it hadnt been given sufficient scrutiny The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County where Edisons failure to pay CalEnergy the countys biggest property taxpayer had outsize implications CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a million property tax payment The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokols first acts after the judges ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time That is great news Leimgruber said Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market Some of the more than other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas Electric We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gasfired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a creditworthy company that in fact pays for the power An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because Californias power crisis has placed them in financial distress just as it has placed utilities in financial distress Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we cant stop them Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy million and that the companyalong with seven other small producershad been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy He said his company no longer intends to do so and he believedbut wasnt certainthat the other companies would shelve their plans Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed million to various small electricity producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam solar energy or wind The alternative energy producersand utilitiesstrenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday The bill spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the Senate on a vote the exact twothirds margin required But it stalled in the Assembly on a partyline vote well short of twothirds When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster said Thats exactly what we have before us The alternative electricity generators including oil companies warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal while representatives of Edison and PGE which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole There isnt enough money Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday It is a very simple question Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in The bill AB X combined several proposals First it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PGE must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying Additionally the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity Wind solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration But most of the alternative energy producers including Chevron and British Petroleum use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat With natural gas prices high they contend they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering Ellingwood reported from El Centro Morain from Sacramento Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at billion up from the billion first thought Californias power grid operator said Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that CalISOs figures dont take into account all their costs A Superior Court judges ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid Verbatim If these guys have such high costs how come theyre making so much money Gary Stern Edisons director of market monitoring and analysis referring to power producers Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Californias electricgrid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by billion or a total of in a month period and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets Meanwhile a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energystarved state but likely at greater cost to the state government The billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO says it isnt seeking a refund for the May through February period because its analysis lacked important market data For example it estimated costs for suppliers based on published prices for natural gas not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel We dont know how much gas actually was purchased at spotmarket prices said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs head of market analysis Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO said FERC needs to become more aggressive about marketpower mitigation The ISOs filing he said was intended to push the agency in that direction since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and naturalgas markets He said that if the FERC doesnt act the state of California may find ways to discipline the market such as through the state attorney generals office The attorney general has been investigating the states electricity market for many months but hasnt brought any court action Dynegy Inc a big owner of power plants in California said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable The Houston company was one of energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling million or show cause why it should be excused Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern Californias Imperial County A judge granted geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc of Omaha Neb permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co and instead seek other buyers These plants known as qualifying facilities are under longterm contract to Edison and other utilities but havent been paid for months Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the states failed utilityderegulation plan While the CalEnergy case involves only about megawatts of power the repercussions could be far greater Collectively hundreds of qualifying facilities or QFs produce as much as of Californias electricity needs QFs totaling megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market presumably to the state government that now is Californias biggest energy buyer An hour after the court decision yesterday some megawatts of power came back into the market the ISO said However additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the states tab Already the state has allocated more than billion for electricity purchases Separately Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a writeoff of as much as billion for Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis the company hasnt yet reported yearend earnings Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals regardless of size from rolling blackouts The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investorowned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than hospitals throughout the state Under PUC rules hospitals with more than beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies But during rolling blackouts Monday at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers Linda Ziegler director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them But hospitals say there is a second lapse before emergency generators kick in which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery You wouldnt fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place said Ann Mosher a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco Backup generators are just that theyre not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis from incidents like lightning or a knockeddown power pole If its a serious problem for the hospital its certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis she said The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the states investor owned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are separately regulated For more than two decades prisons hospitals with more than beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services and are exempted from

judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power Gov Gray Davis has said the state isnt responsible for purchasing the costly lastminute power ISO buys for Edison and PGE despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities behalf ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California Had the decision gone the other way one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders Robinson said Damrells preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter Damrell denied the ISOs request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers Dynegy Inc DYN AES Corp AES and Williams Cos WMB which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling Spokesmen for Reliant Dynegy AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didnt immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired The judge then issued a temporary restraining order requiring the sales but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling The ISO said it would lose about megawatts if the suppliers pulled out enough power for about million households One megawatt is enough for roughly homes Grid officials said Reliants share alone is about megawatts Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that because most of its output is already committed under longterm contracts Reliant which currently provides about of the states power worries it wont get paid due to the financial troubles of PGE and Edison PGE and

Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Many of Californias independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the states three investorowned utilities At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the states Public Utilities Code which links the socalled qualifying facilities electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas Lawmakers however are poised to pass the legislation State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric from a megawatthour to MWh regardless of the price of natural gas Whereas each of the QF contracts differed largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities The cogeneration facilities which produce about megawatts of electricity in the state said the rates are too low and they wont sign new supply contracts with the utilities For MWh natural gas would have to be per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border said Tom Lu executive director of Carsonbased Watson Cogeneration Company the states largest QF generating MW Our current gas price at the border is Other gasfired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week Lu whose company is halfowned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed million by SoCal Ed said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse David Fogarty spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association whose members supply California with more than MW said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than billion for electricity that was already produced State Loses MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about onethird or MW of the states total power supply Roughly MW are produced by natural gasfired facilities The rest is generated by wind solar power and biomass About MW of gasfired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners havent been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cashstrapped utilities SoCal Ed and PGE for nearly four months Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates The defaults have left many of the renewable and gasfired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they cant afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the states utilities but arent being paid even on a forward basis The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electricity grid said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday Gov Gray Davis recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of MWh and MWh for five and year contracts He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward After next week the QF problem will be behind us Davis said Tuesday We want to get the QFs paidthe QFs are dropping like fliesand when that happens the lights go out But this just makes the problem worse said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter a member of the Assembly energy committee I dont know how we are going to keep the lights on Florez said in an interview Many of these congenerators are in my district They said if the legislation doesnt change they are going offline This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts especially now when we need every megawatt Davis who didnt meet with people representing the QFs said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a fiveyear price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities In addition SOCal Ed opposed the legislation saying the rates should be below MWh Some renewable power producers said they arent vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities said his group of gasfired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said Hal Dittmer president of Sacramentobased Wellhead Electric in Sacramento which is owed million by PGE has MW of gasfired generation units offline Under the states plan Dittmer said he risks going out of business I cant buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision he said

MORAIN JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market After two days of statewide blackouts power plants that had been shut down were cranked up Unseasonable heat tapered off The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency But plenty of ominous signs remained Many small producers remained shut down skeptical about Gov Gray Davis plan for utilities to pay them State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the states foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only megawatts of electricity significantly less than the to megawatts previously claimed While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons including the states failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July The Legislature has approved plans to sell billion in bonds but none have yet been issued We are exposed enormously this summer Senate Energy Committee chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey said after looking at the report We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be We

California was forced to start buying electricity in Decemberat a cost of million a daybecause producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators said the report represents a work in progress He said the state may yet sign new contracts However Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to realtime meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand The head of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs He said the state needs to take over the utilities contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business and sign new contracts for megawatts of new wind powerthe cheapest fastest and cleanest source of new supply Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers some of which have not been paid since November But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal sources But most of them generate power using natural gasand the cost of natural gas has been soaring Several natural gas users said Davis plan which caps rates wont cover their fuel costs Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall But small generators say they dont have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis proposal next week It offers producers two choices cents a kilowatthour if they agree to supply power for five years or cents a kilowatthour over years The price of natural gas is higher than that said Marty Quinn executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Any order from the California Public Utilities Commission requiring utilities to pay small independent generators going forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate structure a spokesman for Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison said Wednesday The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require utilities to pay small generators called qualifying facilities a megawatt hour within days of electricity delivery The decision will be voted March by the CPUC Were still reviewing the decision and should have more to say in a day or two To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs a SoCal Edison spokesman said SoCal Edison and PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co are struggling under nearly billion in uncollected power costs due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze Gov Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December Pacific Gas Electric Co has made some partial payments to QFs but SoCal Edison has paid nothing Together they owe the QFs about billion but the order doesnt address that debt An Edison executive said in reaction to the governors sharp comments that the company simply doesnt have the money to pay creditors The root problem here is there just isnt enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster We understand the financial distress the QFs face we are facing financial distress ourselves The proposed PUC order would also require the states investorowned utilities to offer the small generators five and year contracts for power for MWh and MWh respectively The QFs may be able to live with the PUC proposal but the five and year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the California borders are high said Jan SmutnyJones president of the Independent Energy Producers Association Natural gas prices into California are currently higher than anywhere in the country But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money they are still owed

agreement with heavily indebted PGE has a way to go RONE TEMPEST DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday a key consultant to Gov Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the states largest utilities are proceeding at an accelerated pace Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days although those with PGE are much less advanced The administration and PGE have not reached even an agreement in principle he said PGE which has more debt than Edison says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart The state wants to buy the utilities transmission lines and other assets for about billion to provide cash to the utilities help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months To research the grid purchase Fichera said the state has had to pore over documents just to assess the utilities liabilities We are working at a good pace said Fichera chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners If we get to a dealbreaker it might be longer By making Fichera who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission available to reporters Tuesday the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governors plan to pull the state out of the crisis Since midJanuary when the big utilities credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them the state has spent nearly billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas Oklahoma Georgia and North Carolina Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the states electricity The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cashstrapped alternative suppliers including solar biomass and wind power units cut their normal supply to the system in half They say Edison and PGE have not paid them since November the utilities say they are out of cash Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost individual contractors Another delaying factor said Keeley who with state Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers prices was the huge enmity manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities These people just dont like each other This weeks blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration When it comes to electricity size doesnt matterevery kilowatt counts During peak use a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts There is no such thing as a partial solution Unless the whole energy equation is balanced the parts dont work For the Davis plan to work several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the already set in motion The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through longterm contracts with the big outofstate producers These contracts the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group The administration says it has concluded contracts with generators about half of which have been signed According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned billion bond offering to succeed The bonds set for sale in May will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity The state is currently spending at a rate of million a day to buy power If prices stay high the billion in bonds will not cover the states power purchases by the end of the summer Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment Angelides has estimated that under the January law that put the state in the power buying business the state must be reimbursed billion annually and that billion is needed to service the debt PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers known as qualifying facilities must be cut at least in half down from an average of more than cents per kilowatthour In his news conference Tuesday Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at cents for year contracts and cents for fiveyear contracts Meanwhile PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid Lynch said The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they havent been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation said John Nelson a spokesman for PGE The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves mainly from hydro and nuclear sources at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the nearbankrupt utilities to solvency Times staff writers Julie Tamaki Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog As part of secret deal to get longterm energy contracts state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions Critics renew call for full disclosure DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As part of his closeddoor negotiations to buy electricity Gov Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air Davis said Tuesday Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with generators to supply billion worth of power during the next years However the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms contending that release of such information would hamper the states ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity Sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc a power company based in Houston is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the companys deal with the state We couldnt get them to sign contracts it was a sticking point Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM Under the system companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution If their operations pollute more companies are required to purchase credits on an open market Currently the credits cost about per pound of pollutionan amount that can lead to a bill of well over million a year for a power plant The South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the systema step that could considerably cut the states potential cost Davis said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power companys costs It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power she said If it brings down the price of power I dont have a problem with it Nevertheless word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts the critics note The Legislature should have known about it said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco It is going to cost taxpayers money It makes you wonder This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature V John White a lobbyist for the Sierra Club who also represents alternative energy producers called the contract proposal a horrible precedent Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents we cant determine how serious the breach of principle this is White said Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations Terry Francke general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light In the summer when demand for power is highest some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts To avert blackouts state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running In such cases some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any finesalthough Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollutionrelated measures The company which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County said its aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment rose to million in from million in A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegys facilities appear to be fairly cleanalthough Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil which is dirtier than natural gas Davis said he intends to make this information public but he added that we do not want to put the publics interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices Nobody likes the notion that the administration is not being fully forthcoming Davis said But I also have a corollary responsibility that I dont stick these generators with a higher rate FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Following a preliminary nonpublic investigation FERC directed AES Southland Inc and Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co IN on March to show cause why they did not violate section of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability mustrun RMR generator units during a period in April and May The investigation responded to a matter referred by the CalISO If a violation is found Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their marketbased rate authority for a year The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission The CalISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network The CalISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR units availability and a variable payment for the RMR units output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market Williams Energy and the CalISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the CalISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intrazonal congestion The ISO may dispatch a nonRMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available Under its RMR agreement with the ISO Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units However if a nonRMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable Williams will be paid its bid price not the RMR contract price During the April to May period the CalISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos and Huntington Beach as RMR units to provide voltage support However according to the FERC order Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos available from April through May and to make Huntington Beach available from May through May for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units Consequently the CalISO was forced to dispatch nonRMR units at a higher cost namely Williams Energys bid price for service provided by the replacement units By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energys variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units output Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May The bid price for the nonRMR units was at or near the CalISOs theneffective bid cap of MWh FERC continued Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the CalISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the nonRMR units approximately MWh during the period in question This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million The information in this order and a nonpublic appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons Based on this information coupled with Williams Energys financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the CalISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its marketbased rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the CalISOs tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue and whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations a refund by Williams Energy andor AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available and a condition on Williams Energys marketbased rate authority Specifically for a oneyear period if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the CalISO a nonRMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract In other words Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute non RMR unit The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the abovedescribed violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed Further to ensure procurement of all relevant information the Commission instituted a formal nonpublic investigation into the operation maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in and Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California consumers havent been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts consumers arent using less electricity which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid As a result blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities the ISO said ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option but consumers in the state arent heeding the call to reduce consumption Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan and Jan when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints Jim Detmers the ISOs vice president of operation said consumers saved the state about megawatts of electricity enough power for million houses The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about MW or less We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time Detmers said The states Energy Commission said consumers think its no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed People have been saving generally but it isnt a big bump from hour to hour a spokesman for the Energy Commission said Gov Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least of electricity compared with last summer The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Gas Cos Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs Though consumers get a share of the windfall regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus which is expected to be huge this year as a form of price relief The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co Through vigorous deal making the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down For several years the utility has been splitting the savings with ratepayers whenever the companys gas costs fall slightly below market levels Those savings Gas Co executives acknowledged have shot to unprecedented heights during the states power crisis Now in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices regulators are taking another look at the program The question before the Public Utilities Commission Should Gas Co ratepayers who endured huge bill increases this winter get a bigger share of the savings The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded million But the amount for the last months is expected to multiply many times over company executives said partly because the Gas Co has done so well in the wild market by selling lending and trading gas as well as buying it The recent market conditions could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers the PUCs consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates reported Oct even before the latest upward market spirals Gas Co representatives express frustration saying they have done what the state has requested under its gascost incentive program Buy smarter and pass the savings along to its million residential and smallbusiness customers The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost The PUC every time we do well raises the bar on us said Jim Harrigan director of gas acquisition I dont necessarily agree with it By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity the Gas Co has become a big player in the regional natural gas market In the companys bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters employees track price movements pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along Californias border where prices have rocketed The PUC created the cost incentive program for the states three major gas utilitiesSan Diego Gas Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co in Like Southern California Gas SDGE is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Cos trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings Californias gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers monthly gas bills but are not itemized At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed Theres no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the companys award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from belowmarket gas and transportation costs In the early years of the program records show the Gas Cos awards went from zero to million million million and million Last years award of million is awaiting PUC approval This years proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was wellequipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said Harrigan said however that he does not believe the companys level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this years incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June I dont want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the companys award I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers It has been immense Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities The companys gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet Thats more than twice last years cost but only about half what sister company SDGE paid for its customers in February Its also much lower than the per therm PGE pays We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needsabout to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier This presents opportunities At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border With gas price runups like those seen in the last year Pocta said there is a question Should that benefit be shared or flow entirely to ratepayers Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals By the same token we want the Gas Co to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added We want them to have incentives The question is how to balance them Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January The company makes gas sales at various locations It engages in exchanges It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division Before they were lots more riskaverse Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them Records show that the shared savings at SDGE a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gasfired electricitygenerating plants He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year In an annual report to the PUC in February PGE said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle The

Wednesday March Energy Insight Embedded image moved to file picpcx By Dave Todd US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising energy prices Delivering the keynote address at the US Chamber of Commerces national energy summit in Washington Monday Abraham said California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians Not very says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels managing director of Bostonbased METIS Trading Advisors Krapels a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities such as Consolidated Edison design markethedging programs adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the countrys economy in respect to energy security management First of all New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California he said California has hydro nuclear and gas but when it lost a lot of hydro the state needed gas to pick up the slack and the capacity just wasnt there In New Yorks case the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than Californias Krapels added New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning Californias marketplace New Yorks Independent System Operator ISO in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining instate generation capacity reserve margins and a strategy must be put in place whether or not new generation comes online in accordance with current anticipated scenarios A measure of New Yorks essential difficulty is that between and statewide demand for electricity grew MW while generating capacity expanded by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved the gap is expected to continue to widen To avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the states daily generating capacity needs to grow by MW by with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear the ISO wants to see a stateappointed ombudsman named to help wouldbe merchant power plant investors plow through red tape Increasing New Yorks generating capacity will also lessen the states escalating and risky reliance on outofstate sources of electricity the ISO added Since New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from instate sources Not everyone agrees with that analysis insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down interjurisdictional barriers In any case New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the US Northeast such as PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool are in vastly better shape in terms of crossborder cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market In California by contrast the states focusfor example in the case of new gasfired power plant developmenthas been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone rather than on a regional marketplace Embedded image moved to file picpcx The New York ISOs new broadbased analysis of marketrestructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New Yorks utilities to enter into longterm power contracts What needs to be done most it says is to move aggressively to build some of the more than MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline In the meantime the MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldnt be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early longrange weather forecasts Demand however is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to So while New York City the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year it could be a brief rest from the fray Meanwhile a shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan on Long Island and even on barges offshore One way or another whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities its going to be a hot time in the city Longterm solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile attempts at longerterm solutions continue to run into trouble Last week Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that HydroQuebec subsidiary TransEnergie US Ltd wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authoritys load pocket Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound the proposal failed to convince authorities who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut In similar fashion private companies wanting to build small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizationssome of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany The David vs Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good But suddenly in New York Californias troubleswhile still distant in their intensity may not be so far away By some estimates this summers bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last years charges Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isnt going to make the pain go away NEW YORK NYISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES NYISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NYISO said in a recent report Power Alert New Yorks Energy Crossroads New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NYISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report This report is essentially a caution light at New Yorks energy crossroads Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NYISOs warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline In a related development the NYISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NYISOs socalled temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse The NYISO Report The NYISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply The NYISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NYISO said this gap will continue to widen The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New Yorks power consumers The NYISOs modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs Besides large rate increases the NYISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on outofstate resources The report said that if no new instate generation comes on line in the next five years the states generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by Pointing to Californias situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities To avoid these harsh consequences the NYISO said New Yorks new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built The problem according to the NYISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made The NYISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gasfired units On a more positive note the NYISO reported that New Yorks restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter longterm power contracts The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial The report also recommended accelerating conservation realtime metering and pricesensitive load programs and upgrading the states and the Northeasts transmission infrastructure The Proposed Tariff Amendments New Yorks Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NYISOs request to extend from until its MWh bid caps FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them The NYISOs board is sensitive to the Commissions concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related Nevertheless the NYISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York states Article X process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth Moreover although the NYISO proposes to implement several demandside measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently priceresponsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demandside response Thus the NYISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NYISOs proposed demandside response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces Other problems cited in the NYISOs filing which keep New Yorks power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the states CentralEast interface and questions over adequate gas supply The NYISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued Nevertheless the NYISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJMs markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NYISOs bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets The NYISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high runups in prices The NYISOs request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through cited similar problems with New Yorks power markets but claimed that the NYISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws The TEPs were and remain an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NYISO and the Commission intended the filing insisted MASSACHUSETTS Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOSTON AP The states top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see Californiatype electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press Our major problem will come this summer State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California and on Monday California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in to attract more companies to stir competition But that hasnt happened yet largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition said Reilly a Democrat That competition in the wholesale market is not happening Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the regions power A spokeswoman for the regions power grid said electricity use is expected to rise to percent this year but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past months The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand said Ellen Foley spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc which manages the grid of generators connected by miles of high voltage transmission lines Still a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity a situation that arose once last summer Foley said In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation Those customers typically pay more than longterm customers Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into twoyear contracts with suppliers instead of the sixmonth contracts many have now to avoid shortterm price spikes for consumers Reilly said The Attorney Generals Office acts as an advocate for consumers Michael Monahan a spokesman for NSTAR which provides electricity to more than million customers is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod but currently has no lines under construction I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that its something we have to focus on Monahan said but he added The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity Californias statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero California partially deregulated its electric industry in two years before Massachusetts On the Net Attorney Generals Office NSTAR ISO New England Inc NEVADA Discussion of bill stopping power plant sales to continue Wednesday By JOHN WILKERSON Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CARSON CITY Nev AP Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid Californiastyle energy problems The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure its constitutional said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend RReno And thats not as easy as it sounds Townsends comment just before his committee began working on SB was prophetic witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure Translation Dont kill all deals by stopping Renobased Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegasbased Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June and possibly until Pete Ernaut a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before a deal that would be in the publics interest If you put a twoyear moratorium on these plants all these deals are going to go away he said When the cow leaves the barn its difficult to catch Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB on Monday Now its up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee Reliant isnt the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive Earlier this month executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that its in the publics interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant The Harry Allen plant produces about megawatts out of the megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate Pinnacle has plans to expand that to megawatts by Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts dont have to be included in SB Townsend said Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills but the power plant sale issue must be handled now Nevadas PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies merger in under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the states electricity and if theyre sold the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from billion to billion by July if the power plant sales are stopped Nevadas Consumer Advocates Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of million in savings MAINE Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved AUGUSTA Maine AP In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state Maines top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis A panel of industry insiders elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anticompetitive activities In addition the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maines deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity improve conservation and spur competition The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state Maines deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls said Rep William Savage DBuxton House chairman of the Legislatures Utilities Committee Maines law does not cap consumer prices as Californias does and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the states energy needs Savage said Since Maines deregulation law took effect in March Bangor HydroElectric Co rates have increased percent The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers peak load Gov Angus King and all four members of Maines congressional delegation oppose the hike The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co to mediumsized and large industrial users On the other hand some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market In the meantime legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maines deregulated energy industry One would use some of the money from the sale of powergenerating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users said Sen Norman Ferguson RHanover Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maines deregulation law but if it needs fixing it could be done during next years session The lawmakers primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead House Speaker Michael Saxl DPortland said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure ratepayers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes Michaud DEast Millinocket said hes interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern western and eastern Maine Michaud added The commission would include House and Senate members from each party a utility executive and representatives of energy producers providers a large commercial consumer and individual consumers OREGON State Senate moves to combat energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALEM Ore AP In an attempt to avoid a Californialike energy crisis the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources Its important for Oregon It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone said Sen Lee Beyer DSpringfield The measure SB would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources like wind from a year and a half to a matter of months The speededup process would be in effect for two years If we can act now we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer said Sen Jason Atkinson RJacksonville Californias strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note Beyer said though California was definitely a wakeup call the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest With low rainfall hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand Beyer said Gasfired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown DPortland Conservationists however caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards WISCONSIN Two utilities to add megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved Plans of two state utilities to add megawatts to Wisconsins electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to Californias were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding said Steve Hiniker executive director of the Citizens Utility Board which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers Alliant Energy Corp announced its proposal Wednesday in a filing with the state Public Service Commission to spend billion to build one coal and two gasfired power plants Alliant has proposed building a megawatt coalfired plant and a megawatt naturalgas fired plant by It also wants to build a megawatt natural gasfired facility in Wisconsin has not built a coalfired plant in more than two decades Alliant has not determined the plants locations Also Madison Gas Electric the states smallest investorowned utility said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois Three out of the four past summers weve had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state We need to take steps to avoid that and the California situation makes that even more clear said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases but it was too early to say how much rates would go up Californias problems which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II stemmed from underestimating the states power needs forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure longterm supply contracts and freezing rates among other things But Wisconsins situation is far different The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional megawatts of power over the next decade Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added In addition coalgenerated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state We dont have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past said Hiniker This is something the PSC should be doing MGEs deals are A year contract to buy megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May The power will come from the natural gasfired plant Rock River Energy Center near Beloit Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose Califbased Calpine Energy Corp The plant is being built by Northbrook Illbased SkyGen Energy LLC which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp A year contract to buy megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp starting in May The power is coming from a natural gasfired plant near Joliet Ill owned by LS Power Co Rainy River is a unit of Duluthbased Minnesota Power Inc A fiveyear contract to buy megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova Ill in western Illinois The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co which is a unit of Iowabased MidAmerican

rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers

According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall

Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the

created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet

for internal purposes Would you find it helpful to be on the distribution list Hope you are doing well Look forward to touching base soon Forwarded by Suzanne NimocksHOUNorthAmericaMCKINSEY on AM Memorandum TO Pru Sheppard BCC Suzanne Nimocks FROM Pru Sheppard B Venki Venkateshwara DATE March California Power Crisis Update No DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK The weeks highlights include Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn Jeff Gerths story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multiyear investigation of Bill Clinton The key issues are familiar Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps refunds and so on If so what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than cents on the dollar The California ISO filed a complaint claiming billion in overcharges this week The QF irony Through the s QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market In recent months in California they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output But credit problems have created an ironical situation The facts PGE and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PGE and Edison into bankruptcy Some gasfired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas Last weeks court decision allows MidAmericanCalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility CalEnergy does so immediately selling to El Paso The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO when requested regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO Reliant announced it will appeal the order This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the situations are probably different The QF contracts predate the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies In fact many QF contracts have the opposite provision authority for the utility to cut takes during socalled light load periods Stage emergency and rolling blackoutsagain There was another Stage emergency in California with rolling blackouts this week This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March Among the factors Increased demand from summerlike temperatures Cutbacks in imports Loss of MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant Loss of about MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say US Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits An internal memorandum laid out two choices The agency could audit and punish bad actors the companies that were exploiting the market Or it could identify bad hours when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobodys fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors the memorandum said The commission took the easier way It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few bad hours in January and February That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during good hours when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme The order ignored those hours Today in a criticism of the agencys lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies But the agencys track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely softpedaled its role as the electricity industrys top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials The agencys defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely handsoff approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say Californias rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits The agencys critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by freemarket passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was insufficient data in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies Yet his own former employer PGE Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the midAtlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics The agencys inaction the critics say leads to gaming jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track Were trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers Mr Hebert said Fight Over Deregulation Todays debate traces back to the s when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years Two Republican seats are currently unfilled The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late s after the agency had begun opening the gas markets By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the midAtlantic states Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market But the agencys balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AYbear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions Mr Hebert said high prices in California were sending the right signals to get supply there Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging unlawful and said that his agency by not reining them in is simply not doing its job The agencys leadership has been in flux for months Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports Though Mr Heberts positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically freemarket position of any commissioner He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces When Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies debt Mr Heberts response was dismissive Its not in the interest of the American public he pronounced Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks The midAtlantic region experienced some early volatility As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called market power the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the midAtlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate The decision roiled some agency officials Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring LocalFederal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much The industry not surprisingly shares that view One vocal critic was Mr Miller Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energytrading unit of PGE Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during Californias crisis Mr Millers former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide PGE Energy Trading by several estimates is now the secondlargest seller of electricity in New England The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PGE and other companies Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged very high prices when it could One persons predatory pricing is another persons competitive advantage Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in New England regulators too often acted as judge jury and executioner when overseeing the market he said One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New Englands problems from the regulators perspective Their Nov report attributed New Englands frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws As Mr Millers team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agencys began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New Englands ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said They said the department was examining whether PGE and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year PGE confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the departments requests Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PGE or at the agency His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PGE and his duties at the agency Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agencys San Francisco office One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show Daniel Larcamp Mr Millers supervisor said there might have been more information that could have been obtained in the California inquiry But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so timeconsuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PGE The lawyers said Mr Millers participation had been permissible because PGE was not the subject of the investigation When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market But while the companies had the potential to exercise market power the commission said there was insufficient data to prove that they did Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices When the agencys own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a lastminute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a timeconsuming investigation During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal misbehavior by sellers bad actors always seems to fail his memorandum said It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours The suggestion won the day The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several privatesector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons Because most highpriced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as just and reasonable the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis The problem with my agency is that were so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that weve gotten sloppy Mr Massey said Were talking about electricity Its the juice of the economy so its got to be available and reasonably priced Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved TULSA Okla AP Williams Cos Inc says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold overpriced electricity to California Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co a unit of Tulsabased Williams owes California more than million in refunds for power it sold to the states Independent System Operator The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for million in overcharges from transactions in January and February The Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid claims the state was overcharged billion by wholesale power providers including Williams between May and February Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO According to the commission power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions However the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams power prices Collins said The commission will review Williams explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds Allegheny Energy makes big California connection Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved HAGERSTOWN Md AP Allegheny Energy Inc said Thursday it has agreed to sell billion worth of power to Californias electricitypurchasing agency over the next years The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to megawatts that the Hagerstownbased company has secured from western generating plants through its new energy trading division Allegheny Energy Global Markets formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets This is a winwin for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy It provides a longterm source of fixedprice energy and should help to stabilize prices in California said Michael P Morrell president of the Allegheny Energy Supply division Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power which delivers electric energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALT LAKE CITY AP The Williams Cos plans to expands its Kern River pipeline which runs through Utah to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California Williams gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line Construction on the billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May said Kirk Morgan director of business development for Kern River pipeline Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin where producers are aggressively stepping up production Morgan said The new pipeline is expected to deliver about million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah Nevada and California Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California If all of the pipelines capacity were used to generate electricity it could produce about megawatts That is enough to light around million homes Morgan said The original Kern River line was completed in It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield Calif It currently transports million cubic feet of natural gas per day Williams based in Tulsa Okla recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by million cubic feet per day That million pumping station project should be completed by July During the construction period the Kern River project will employ between and people The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from million to about million Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline Morgan said The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities including St George and Cedar City Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full capacity so this is an opportunity to transport additional gas into those areas from companyowned supplies in Wyoming said Questar Gas spokeswoman Audra Sorensen Calif Energy Commission OKs Pwr Plants

supply By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Some CalEnergy Power Could Be Sold Outside Calif CEO Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Some of CalEnergy Operating Corps power could end up being sold outside of California though that is not the companys intent CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday CalEnergy an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co which is majority owned by Warren Buffetts BerkshireHathaway BRKA was given legal authority Thursday to suspend megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling We stopped supplying power at PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since thenWe are selling it to marketers our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us Sokol said Sokol added that while it was his companys intention to have its power sold to California that could not be guaranteed We leave the energy selling to El PasoWeve directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we cant stop them from selling out of state Sokol said Wholesale prices on the open market are about a megawatthour three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed The courts ruling did not address the million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power and Sokol said that his companys separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utilitys assets as payment for that debt Sokol said the courts ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small independent generators known as qualifying facilities or QFs who have not received payment from SoCal Ed Edisons own lawyer said it bestthat every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market Sokol said Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadnt won the case but said he couldnt speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome A group of renewable power suppliers owed more than million from SoCal Ed said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability The utilities claim close to billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze In a statement SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergys bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergys request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors While many of the states large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California the QFs which make up onethird of the states total power supply havent been paid by SoCal Ed since November PGE has made partial payments to its QFs By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold contributed to this article California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO Californias balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison allowing it to sell power on the open market The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the states financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas Electric which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small alternative energy producerswhich together provide nearly a third of the states powerget paid But Assembly Republicans opposed it saying it hadnt been given sufficient scrutiny The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County where Edisons failure to pay CalEnergy the countys biggest property taxpayer had outsize implications CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a million property tax payment The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokols first acts after the judges ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time That is great news Leimgruber said Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market Some of the more than other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas Electric We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gasfired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a creditworthy company that in fact pays for the power An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because Californias power crisis has placed them in financial distress just as it has placed utilities in financial distress Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we cant stop them Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy million and that the companyalong with seven other small producershad been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy He said his company no longer intends to do so and he believedbut wasnt certainthat the other companies would shelve their plans Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed million to various small electricity producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam solar energy or wind The alternative energy producersand utilitiesstrenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday The bill spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the Senate on a vote the exact twothirds margin required But it stalled in the Assembly on a partyline vote well short of twothirds When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster said Thats exactly what we have before us The alternative electricity generators including oil companies warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal while representatives of Edison and PGE which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole There isnt enough money Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday It is a very simple question Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in The bill AB X combined several proposals First it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PGE must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying Additionally the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity Wind solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration But most of the alternative energy producers including Chevron and British Petroleum use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat With natural gas prices high they contend they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering Ellingwood reported from El Centro Morain from Sacramento Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at billion up from the billion first thought Californias power grid operator said Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that CalISOs figures dont take into account all their costs A Superior Court judges ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid Verbatim If these guys have such high costs how come theyre making so much money Gary Stern Edisons director of market monitoring and analysis referring to power producers Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Californias electricgrid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by billion or a total of in a month period and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets Meanwhile a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energystarved state but likely at greater cost to the state government The billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO says it isnt seeking a refund for the May through February period because its analysis lacked important market data For example it estimated costs for suppliers based on published prices for natural gas not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel We dont know how much gas actually was purchased at spotmarket prices said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs head of market analysis Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO said FERC needs to become more aggressive about marketpower mitigation The ISOs filing he said was intended to push the agency in that direction since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and naturalgas markets He said that if the FERC doesnt act the state of California may find ways to discipline the market such as through the state attorney generals office The attorney general has been investigating the states electricity market for many months but hasnt brought any court action Dynegy Inc a big owner of power plants in California said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable The Houston company was one of energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling million or show cause why it should be excused Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern Californias Imperial County A judge granted geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc of Omaha Neb permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co and instead seek other buyers These plants known as qualifying facilities are under longterm contract to Edison and other utilities but havent been paid for months Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the states failed utilityderegulation plan While the CalEnergy case involves only about megawatts of power the repercussions could be far greater Collectively hundreds of qualifying facilities or QFs produce as much as of Californias electricity needs QFs totaling megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market presumably to the state government that now is Californias biggest energy buyer An hour after the court decision yesterday some megawatts of power came back into the market the ISO said However additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the states tab Already the state has allocated more than billion for electricity purchases Separately Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a writeoff of as much as billion for Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis the company hasnt yet reported yearend earnings Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals regardless of size from rolling blackouts The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investorowned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than hospitals throughout the state Under PUC rules hospitals with more than beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies But during rolling blackouts Monday at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers Linda Ziegler director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them But hospitals say there is a second lapse before emergency generators kick in which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery You wouldnt fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place said Ann Mosher a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco Backup generators are just that theyre not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis from incidents like lightning or a knockeddown power pole If its a serious problem for the hospital its certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis she said The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the states investor owned utilities PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are separately regulated For more than two decades prisons hospitals with more than beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services and are exempted from blackouts by order of state power regulators After rolling blackouts began darkening the state in January many other public service groups began seeking relief from power interruptions including transit systems schools and water districts On the Net Federal Judge Orders Reliant To Keep Selling Pwr To Calif Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc SACRAMENTO Calif APA federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not get paid US District Judge Frank C Damrell Jr said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant Energy REI stopped selling power to the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power grid The ISO buys lastminute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply Damrell dismissed Reliants attempt to force the state Department of Water Resources to back the ISOs purchases for the states two biggest utilities The state has been spending about million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power Gov Gray Davis has said the state isnt responsible for purchasing the costly lastminute power ISO buys for Edison and PGE despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities behalf ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California Had the decision gone the other way one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders Robinson said Damrells preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter Damrell denied the ISOs request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers Dynegy Inc DYN AES Corp AES and Williams Cos WMB which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling Spokesmen for Reliant Dynegy AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didnt immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired The judge then issued a temporary restraining order requiring the sales but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling The ISO said it would lose about megawatts if the suppliers pulled out enough power for about million households One megawatt is enough for roughly homes Grid officials said Reliants share alone is about megawatts Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that because most of its output is already committed under longterm contracts Reliant which currently provides about of the states power worries it wont get paid due to the financial troubles of PGE and Edison PGE and Edison say that together they have lost about billion since June due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that Californias deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Many of Californias independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the states three investorowned utilities At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the states Public Utilities Code which links the socalled qualifying facilities electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas Lawmakers however are poised to pass the legislation State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric from a megawatthour to MWh regardless of the price of natural gas Whereas each of the QF contracts differed largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities The cogeneration facilities which produce about megawatts of electricity in the state said the rates are too low and they wont sign new supply contracts with the utilities For MWh natural gas would have to be per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border said Tom Lu executive director of Carsonbased Watson Cogeneration Company the states largest QF generating MW Our current gas price at the border is Other gasfired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week Lu whose company is halfowned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed million by SoCal Ed said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse David Fogarty spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association whose members supply California with more than MW said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than billion for electricity that was already produced State Loses MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about onethird or MW of the states total power supply Roughly MW are produced by natural gasfired facilities The rest is generated by wind solar power and biomass About MW of gasfired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners havent been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cashstrapped utilities SoCal Ed and PGE for nearly four months Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates The defaults have left many of the renewable and gasfired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they cant afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the states utilities but arent being paid even on a forward basis The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electricity grid said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday Gov Gray Davis recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of MWh and MWh for five and year contracts He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward After next week the QF problem will be behind us Davis said Tuesday We want to get the QFs paidthe QFs are dropping like fliesand when that happens the lights go out But this just makes the problem worse said Assemblyman Dean Florez DShafter a member of the Assembly energy committee I dont know how we are going to keep the lights on Florez said in an interview Many of these congenerators are in my district They said if the legislation doesnt change they are going offline This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts especially now when we need every megawatt Davis who didnt meet with people representing the QFs said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a fiveyear price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities In addition SOCal Ed opposed the legislation saying the rates should be below MWh Some renewable power producers said they arent vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities said his group of gasfired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said Hal Dittmer president of Sacramentobased Wellhead Electric in Sacramento which is owed million by PGE has MW of gasfired generation units offline Under the states plan Dittmer said he risks going out of business I cant buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision he said

MORAIN JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market After two days of statewide blackouts power plants that had been shut down were cranked up Unseasonable heat tapered off The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency But plenty of ominous signs remained Many small producers remained shut down skeptical about Gov Gray Davis plan for utilities to pay them State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the states foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only megawatts of electricity significantly less than the to megawatts previously claimed While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons including the states failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July The Legislature has approved plans to sell billion in bonds but none have yet been issued We are exposed

California was forced to start buying electricity in Decemberat a cost of million a daybecause producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators said the report represents a work in progress He said the state may yet sign new contracts However Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to realtime meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand The head of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs He said the state needs to take over the utilities contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business and sign new contracts for megawatts of new wind powerthe cheapest fastest and cleanest source of new supply Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers some of which have not been paid since November But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal sources But most of them generate power using natural gasand the cost of natural gas has been soaring Several natural gas users said Davis plan which caps rates wont cover their fuel costs Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall But small generators say they dont have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis proposal next week It offers producers two choices cents a kilowatthour if they agree to supply power for five years or cents a kilowatthour over years The price of natural gas is higher than that said Marty Quinn executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Any order from the California Public Utilities Commission requiring utilities to pay small independent generators going forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate structure a spokesman for Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison said Wednesday The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require utilities to pay small generators called qualifying facilities a megawatt hour within days of electricity delivery The decision will be voted March by the CPUC Were still reviewing the decision and should have more to say in a day or two To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs a SoCal Edison spokesman said SoCal Edison and PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co are struggling under nearly billion in uncollected power costs due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze Gov Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December Pacific Gas Electric Co has made some partial payments to QFs but SoCal Edison has paid nothing Together they owe the QFs about billion but the order doesnt address that debt An Edison executive said in reaction to the governors sharp comments that the company simply doesnt have the money to pay creditors The root problem here is there just isnt enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster We understand the financial distress the QFs face we are facing financial distress ourselves The proposed PUC order would also require the states investorowned utilities to offer the small generators five and year contracts for power for MWh and MWh respectively The QFs may be able to live with the PUC proposal but the five and year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the California borders are high said Jan SmutnyJones president of the Independent Energy Producers Association Natural gas prices into California are currently higher than anywhere in the country But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money they are still owed

agreement with heavily indebted PGE has a way to go RONE TEMPEST DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday a key consultant to Gov Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the states largest utilities are proceeding at an accelerated pace Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days although those with PGE are much less advanced The administration and PGE have not reached even an agreement in principle he said PGE which has more debt than Edison says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart The state wants to buy the utilities transmission lines and other assets for about billion to provide cash to the utilities help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months To research the grid purchase Fichera said the state has had to pore over documents just to assess the utilities liabilities We are working at a good pace said Fichera chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners If we get to a dealbreaker it might be longer By making Fichera who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission available to reporters Tuesday the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governors plan to pull the state out of the crisis Since midJanuary when the big utilities credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them the state has spent nearly billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas Oklahoma Georgia and North Carolina Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the states electricity The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cashstrapped alternative suppliers including solar biomass and wind power units cut their normal supply to the system in half They say Edison and PGE have not paid them since November the utilities say they are out of cash Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost individual contractors Another delaying factor said Keeley who with state Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers prices was the huge enmity manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities These people just dont like each other This weeks blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration When it comes to electricity size doesnt matterevery kilowatt counts During peak use a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts There is no such thing as a partial solution Unless the whole energy equation is balanced the parts dont work For the Davis plan to work several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the already set in motion The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through longterm contracts with the big outofstate producers These contracts the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group The administration says it has concluded contracts with generators about half of which have been signed According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources which buys power for the state current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned billion bond offering to succeed The bonds set for sale in May will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity The state is currently spending at a rate of million a day to buy power If prices stay high the billion in bonds will not cover the states power purchases by the end of the summer Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment Angelides has estimated that under the January law that put the state in the power buying business the state must be reimbursed billion annually and that billion is needed to service the debt PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers known as qualifying facilities must be cut at least in half down from an average of more than cents per kilowatthour In his news conference Tuesday Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at cents for year contracts and cents for fiveyear contracts Meanwhile PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid Lynch said The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they havent been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation said John Nelson a spokesman for PGE The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves mainly from hydro and nuclear sources at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the nearbankrupt utilities to solvency Times staff writers Julie Tamaki Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog As part of secret deal to get longterm energy contracts state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions Critics renew call for full disclosure DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO As part of his closeddoor negotiations to buy electricity Gov Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air Davis said Tuesday Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with generators to supply billion worth of power during the next years However the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms contending that release of such information would hamper the states ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity Sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc a power company based in Houston is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the companys deal with the state We couldnt get them to sign contracts it was a sticking point Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM Under the system companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution If their operations pollute more companies are required to purchase credits on an open market Currently the credits cost about per pound of pollutionan amount that can lead to a bill of well over million a year for a power plant The South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the systema step that could considerably cut the states potential cost Davis said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power companys costs It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power she said If it brings down the price of power I dont have a problem with it Nevertheless word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts the critics note The Legislature should have known about it said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco It is going to cost taxpayers money It makes you wonder This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature V John White a lobbyist for the Sierra Club who also represents alternative energy producers called the contract proposal a horrible precedent Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents we cant determine how serious the breach of principle this is White said Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations Terry Francke general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light In the summer when demand for power is highest some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts To avert blackouts state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running In such cases some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any finesalthough Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollutionrelated measures The company which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County said its aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment rose to million in from million in A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegys facilities appear to be fairly cleanalthough Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil which is dirtier than natural gas Davis said he intends to make this information public but he added that we do not want to put the publics interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices Nobody likes the notion that the administration is not being fully forthcoming Davis said But I also have a corollary responsibility that I dont stick these generators with a higher rate FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Following a preliminary nonpublic investigation FERC directed AES Southland Inc and Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co IN on March to show cause why they did not violate section of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability mustrun RMR generator units during a period in April and May The investigation responded to a matter referred by the CalISO If a violation is found Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their marketbased rate authority for a year The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission The CalISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network The CalISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR units availability and a variable payment for the RMR units output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market Williams Energy and the CalISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the CalISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intrazonal congestion The ISO may dispatch a nonRMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available Under its RMR agreement with the ISO Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units However if a nonRMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable Williams will be paid its bid price not the RMR contract price During the April to May period the CalISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos and Huntington Beach as RMR units to provide voltage support However according to the FERC order Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos available from April through May and to make Huntington Beach available from May through May for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units Consequently the CalISO was forced to dispatch nonRMR units at a higher cost namely Williams Energys bid price for service provided by the replacement units By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energys variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units output Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May The bid price for the nonRMR units was at or near the CalISOs theneffective bid cap of MWh FERC continued Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the CalISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the nonRMR units approximately MWh during the period in question This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million The information in this order and a nonpublic appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons Based on this information coupled with Williams Energys financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the CalISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its marketbased rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the CalISOs tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue and whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations a refund by Williams Energy andor AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available and a condition on Williams Energys marketbased rate authority Specifically for a oneyear period if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the CalISO a nonRMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract In other words Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute non RMR unit The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the abovedescribed violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed Further to ensure procurement of all relevant information the Commission instituted a formal nonpublic investigation into the operation maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in

electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts consumers arent using less electricity which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid As a result blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities the ISO said ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option but consumers in the state arent heeding the call to reduce consumption Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan and Jan when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints Jim Detmers the ISOs vice president of operation said consumers saved the state about megawatts of electricity enough power for million houses The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about MW or less We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time Detmers said The states Energy Commission said consumers think its no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed People have been saving generally but it isnt a big bump from hour to hour a spokesman for the Energy Commission said Gov Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill

share of the windfall regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus which is expected to be huge this year as a form of price relief The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co Through vigorous deal making the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down For several years the utility has been splitting the savings with ratepayers whenever the companys gas costs fall slightly below market levels Those savings Gas Co executives acknowledged have shot to unprecedented heights during the states power crisis Now in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices regulators are taking another look at the program The question before the Public Utilities Commission Should Gas Co ratepayers who endured huge bill increases this winter get a bigger share of the savings The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded million But the amount for the last months is expected to multiply many times over company executives said partly because the Gas Co has done so well in the wild market by selling lending and trading gas as well as buying it The recent market conditions could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers the PUCs consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates reported Oct even before the latest upward market spirals Gas Co representatives express frustration saying they have done what the state has requested under its gascost incentive program Buy smarter and pass the savings along to its million residential and smallbusiness customers The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost The PUC every time we do well raises the bar on us said Jim Harrigan director of gas acquisition I dont necessarily agree with it By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity the Gas Co has become a big player in the regional natural gas market In the companys bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters employees track price movements pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along Californias border where prices have rocketed The PUC created the cost incentive program for the states three major gas utilitiesSan Diego Gas Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co in Like Southern California Gas SDGE is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Cos trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings Californias gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers monthly gas bills but are not itemized At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed Theres no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the companys award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from belowmarket gas and transportation costs In the early years of the program records show the Gas Cos awards went from zero to million million million and million Last years award of million is awaiting PUC approval This years proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was wellequipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said Harrigan said however that he does not believe the companys level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this years incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June I dont want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the companys award I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers It has been immense Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities The companys gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet Thats more than twice last years cost but only about half what sister company SDGE paid for its customers in February Its also much lower than the per therm PGE pays We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needsabout to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier This presents opportunities At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border With gas price runups like those seen in the last year Pocta said there is a question Should that benefit be shared or flow entirely to ratepayers Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals By the same token we want the Gas Co to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added We want them to have incentives The question is how to balance them Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January The company makes gas sales at various locations It engages in exchanges It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division Before they were lots more riskaverse Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them Records show that the shared savings at SDGE a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gasfired electricitygenerating plants He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year In an annual report to the PUC in February PGE said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer advocacy group said it will closely watch the PUCs evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co We want to make sure given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said Well look to see whether the mechanism should be changed Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter longterm contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market Unfortunately under the system he said the only incentive is to beat the spot market Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section See attached file Dow Jones

Wednesday March Energy Insight Embedded image moved to file picpcx By Dave Todd US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham declared this week that the Big Apple is on the verge of being bitten hard by power cuts and rising energy prices Delivering the keynote address at the US Chamber of Commerces national energy summit in Washington Monday Abraham said California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians Not very says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels managing director of Bostonbased METIS Trading Advisors Krapels a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities such as Consolidated Edison design markethedging programs adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the countrys economy in respect to energy security management First of all New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California he said California has hydro nuclear and gas but when it lost a lot of hydro the state needed gas to pick up the slack and the capacity just wasnt there In New Yorks case the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than Californias Krapels added New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning Californias marketplace New Yorks Independent System Operator ISO in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining instate generation capacity reserve margins and a strategy must be put in place whether or not new generation comes online in accordance with current anticipated scenarios A measure of New Yorks essential difficulty is that between and statewide demand for electricity grew MW while generating capacity expanded by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved the gap is expected to continue to widen To avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the states daily generating capacity needs to grow by MW by with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear the ISO wants to see a stateappointed ombudsman named to help wouldbe merchant power plant investors plow through red tape Increasing New Yorks generating capacity will also lessen the states escalating and risky reliance on outofstate sources of electricity the ISO added Since New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from instate sources Not everyone agrees with that analysis insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down interjurisdictional barriers In any case New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the US Northeast such as PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool are in vastly better shape in terms of crossborder cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market In California by contrast the states focusfor example in the case of new gasfired power plant developmenthas been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone rather than on a regional marketplace Embedded image moved to file picpcx The New York ISOs new broadbased analysis of marketrestructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New Yorks utilities to enter into longterm power contracts What needs to be done most it says is to move aggressively to build some of the more than MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline In the meantime the MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldnt be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early longrange weather forecasts Demand however is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to So while New York City the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year it could be a brief rest from the fray Meanwhile a shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan on Long Island and even on barges offshore One way or another whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities its going to be a hot time in the city Longterm solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile attempts at longerterm solutions continue to run into trouble Last week Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that HydroQuebec subsidiary TransEnergie US Ltd wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authoritys load pocket Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound the proposal failed to convince authorities who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut In similar fashion private companies wanting to build small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizationssome of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany The David vs Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good But suddenly in New York Californias troubleswhile still distant in their intensity may not be so far away By some estimates this summers bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last years charges Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isnt going to make the pain go away NEW YORK NYISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES NYISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Foster Electric Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis the New York Independent System Operator Inc NYISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NYISO said in a recent report Power Alert New Yorks Energy Crossroads New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NYISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report This report is essentially a caution light at New Yorks energy crossroads Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NYISOs warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline In a related development the NYISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NYISOs socalled temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse The NYISO Report The NYISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply The NYISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NYISO said this gap will continue to widen The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New Yorks power consumers The NYISOs modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs Besides large rate increases the NYISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on outofstate resources The report said that if no new instate generation comes on line in the next five years the states generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by Pointing to Californias situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities To avoid these harsh consequences the NYISO said New Yorks new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built The problem according to the NYISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made The NYISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gasfired units On a more positive note the NYISO reported that New Yorks restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter longterm power contracts The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial The report also recommended accelerating conservation realtime metering and pricesensitive load programs and upgrading the states and the Northeasts transmission infrastructure The Proposed Tariff Amendments New Yorks Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NYISOs request to extend from until its MWh bid caps FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them The NYISOs board is sensitive to the Commissions concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related Nevertheless the NYISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York states Article X process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth Moreover although the NYISO proposes to implement several demandside measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently priceresponsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demandside response Thus the NYISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NYISOs proposed demandside response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces Other problems cited in the NYISOs filing which keep New Yorks power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the states CentralEast interface and questions over adequate gas supply The NYISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued Nevertheless the NYISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJMs markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NYISOs bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets The NYISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high runups in prices The NYISOs request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through cited similar problems with New Yorks power markets but claimed that the NYISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws The TEPs were and remain an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NYISO and the Commission intended the filing insisted MASSACHUSETTS Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOSTON AP The states top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see Californiatype electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press Our major problem will come this summer State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California and on Monday California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in to attract more companies to stir competition But that hasnt happened yet largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition said Reilly a Democrat That competition in the wholesale market is not happening Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the regions power A spokeswoman for the regions power grid said electricity use is expected to rise to percent this year but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past months The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand said Ellen Foley spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc which manages the grid of generators connected by miles of high voltage transmission lines Still a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity a situation that arose once last summer Foley said In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation Those customers typically pay more than longterm customers Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into twoyear contracts with suppliers instead of the sixmonth contracts many have now to avoid shortterm price spikes for consumers Reilly said The Attorney Generals Office acts as an advocate for consumers Michael Monahan a spokesman for NSTAR which provides electricity to more than million customers is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod but currently has no lines under construction I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that its something we have to focus on Monahan said but he added The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity Californias statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero California partially deregulated its electric industry in two years before Massachusetts On the Net Attorney Generals Office NSTAR ISO New England Inc NEVADA Discussion of bill stopping power plant sales to continue Wednesday By JOHN WILKERSON Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CARSON CITY Nev AP Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid Californiastyle energy problems The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure its constitutional said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend RReno And thats not as easy as it sounds Townsends comment just before his committee began working on SB was prophetic witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure Translation Dont kill all deals by stopping Renobased Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegasbased Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June and possibly until Pete Ernaut a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before a deal that would be in the publics interest If you put a twoyear moratorium on these plants all these deals are going to go away he said When the cow leaves the barn its difficult to catch Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB on Monday Now its up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee Reliant isnt the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive Earlier this month executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that its in the publics interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant The Harry Allen plant produces about megawatts out of the megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate Pinnacle has plans to expand that to megawatts by Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts dont have to be included in SB Townsend said Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills but the power plant sale issue must be handled now Nevadas PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies merger in under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the states electricity and if theyre sold the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from billion to billion by July if the power plant sales are stopped Nevadas Consumer Advocates Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of million in savings MAINE Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved AUGUSTA Maine AP In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state Maines top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis A panel of industry insiders elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anticompetitive activities In addition the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maines deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity improve conservation and spur competition The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state Maines deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls said Rep William Savage DBuxton House chairman of the Legislatures Utilities Committee Maines law does not cap consumer prices as Californias does and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the states energy needs Savage said Since Maines deregulation law took effect in March Bangor HydroElectric Co rates have increased percent The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers peak load Gov Angus King and all four members of Maines congressional delegation oppose the hike The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co to mediumsized and large industrial users On the other hand some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market In the meantime legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maines deregulated energy industry One would use some of the money from the sale of powergenerating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users said Sen Norman Ferguson RHanover Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maines deregulation law but if it needs fixing it could be done during next years session The lawmakers primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead House Speaker Michael Saxl DPortland said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure ratepayers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes Michaud DEast Millinocket said hes interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern western and eastern Maine Michaud added The commission would include House and Senate members from each party a utility executive and representatives of energy producers providers a large commercial consumer and individual consumers OREGON State Senate moves to combat energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SALEM Ore AP In an attempt to avoid a Californialike energy crisis the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources Its important for Oregon It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone said Sen Lee Beyer DSpringfield The measure SB would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources like wind from a year and a half to a matter of months The speededup process would be in effect for two years If we can act now we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer said Sen Jason Atkinson RJacksonville Californias strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note Beyer said though California was definitely a wakeup call the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest With low rainfall hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand Beyer said Gasfired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown DPortland Conservationists however caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards WISCONSIN Two utilities to add megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved Plans of two state utilities to add megawatts to Wisconsins electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to Californias were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding said Steve Hiniker executive director of the Citizens Utility Board which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers Alliant Energy Corp announced its proposal Wednesday in a filing with the state Public Service Commission to spend billion to build one coal and two gasfired power plants Alliant has proposed building a megawatt coalfired plant and a megawatt naturalgas fired plant by It also wants to build a megawatt natural gasfired facility in Wisconsin has not built a coalfired plant in more than two decades Alliant has not determined the plants locations Also Madison Gas Electric the states smallest investorowned utility said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois Three out of the four past summers weve had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state We need to take steps to avoid that and the California situation makes that even more clear said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases but it was too early to say how much rates would go up Californias problems which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II stemmed from underestimating the states power needs forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure longterm supply contracts and freezing rates among other things But Wisconsins situation is far different The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional megawatts of power over the next decade Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added In addition coalgenerated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state We dont have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past said Hiniker This is something the PSC should be doing MGEs deals are A year contract to buy megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May The power will come from the natural gasfired plant Rock River Energy Center near Beloit Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose Califbased Calpine Energy Corp The plant is being built by Northbrook Illbased SkyGen Energy LLC which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp A year contract to buy megawatts of power from the Rainy

Arkin CC BCC FROM Carol B White Pru Sheppard EU EPNG RI DATE December Power sector restructuring international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East

open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW

monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent

Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint

for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations

remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in

constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability

lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged

fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of

conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone

Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links

station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving to reduce its reliance on hydropower by allowing IPPs to build deisel gas and light crude plants Regionally Ghana is committed to building a West African Power Pool WAPP by expanding electricity generation and interconnections Morocco Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded for Tangiers and Tetouan The concession covers the provision of water sewerage and electrical services to these two northern areas Two earlier powerwater concessions Casablanca Rabat were awarded Morocco has an active IPP program one of the plants was even transferred to the builders after its completion No sale of transmission assets is planned Nigeria The IMF has provided Nigeria a billion facility to encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo In November the government announced plans to privatize ailing NEPA the SOU While a draft electricity policy has been prepared no details have emerged They intend to send regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of December which should include a framework for foreign IPP investors It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up prior to privatization Enron is supplying MW via bargemounted power facilties off Lagos to ease

Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new

electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been privatized A second tranche should take place in A pool mechanism should be operating by Consortia of industrials using more GWhyear can contract directly with IPPs by the threshold will be GWh year The potential free market currently amounts to TWh a year or of total demand This will increase to in ENEL who has a de facto monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent system can currently supply eligible customers who consume more than GWhyear at a single site The countrys four discos may purchase up to of consumption outside the public system Portugals regulator ERSE needs either to extend the eligible customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to reach the percents required by the Directive The government sold another stake of of stateowned Electricidade de Portugal in October following two successful offerings in and This offering raised billion The state retains and golden share voting rights Rui de Sousa Spain After several major Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint ownership In the generation market the incumbents share continues to decline National Power and PowerGen have divested further capacity and now stand at and The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations have not yet been written The government is working with the IMF to set up financial controls and eliminate crosssubsidies Between and all generation will be upgraded or privatized Transmission will remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant Temelin which should begin operating by spring CEZ plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by after the commercial launch of Temelin Kristina Kalinova

Ilkei White Moldova The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of Modova giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution companies then in three generators The first attempt to privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids All companies will require substantial investment for upgrades White Romania In September the national electric company Conel was split into four independent units These encompass fossil generation hydro generation transmission and distribution and metering Restructuring precedes eventual privatization which will begin with distribution followed by generation Current law requires foreign owners to have a local partner As Romania is one of the countries invited to join accession talks with the EU it is opening its market in stages Currently GWh has choice this will rise to GWh next year Evenually elegibility thresholds will be lowered to GWh then GWh Cs IlkeiWhite Russia In the mids the Unified Energy Systems of Russia Joint Stock Company UES also known as RAO was organized into regional joint stock companies UES

constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability Recent MA activity has seen already privatized Victorian distribution retail and transmission change hands with new owners coming from Asia ElectraNet South Australias SA transco was sold as a year lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged

fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially

stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone

Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links The Mozambique Transmission Company links South Africa Mozambique and Swaziland the West African Power Pool will link countries there is a SixCountry link underway between Egypt Jordan Iraq Syria and Turkey and later Lebanon Algeria Interior minister Khelil who as a World Bank official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in several countries is committed to a profound restructuring of Sonatrach the NOC and the power sector Sonelgaz Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle GTD end Sonelgaz generation monopoly and allow for IPPs on a BOT basis Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic consumption and some for export Algeria is keenly interested in sending power to deregulating European markets via a new undersea link to Spain Ghana With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving

the power shortages in this oilrich country Senegal Showing how risky foreign investment remains the new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qubec and Elyo to leave less than two years after they won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The
