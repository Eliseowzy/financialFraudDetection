Mark E CT cc Lance Schuler CT Subject Cypress Exploration ProgramOperatorCash Call Issue Mark I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about As I mentioned in my voicemail to you I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed Steve was out of the office much of last week he followed up Friday with the attached email message As Steve mentions in his email there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steves execution From Steves reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout which had been initialled by Allen I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen Steve is one of the best and the brightest Ive worked with at Enron He is extremely busy working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E P assets as well as working on new deals I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated I will remind the ECR group at Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our directowned ventures I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in CypressAcadian Bonne Terre Vastar ventures

PGE expires at am EST on February In view of the DOE warnings that the order will not be extended PGE has received permission from the CPUC to grant to certain gas suppliers a security interest in certain of its receivables and a draft security agreement and other documents were circulated over the weekend Here is a summary of the proposal and associated risks Summary of Proposal The security interest will be granted only to those gas suppliers that execute the security agreement If we dont sign the agreement we will remain unsecured there are reasons to refuse to sign see below PGE is granting a security interest in core customer receivables and will also grant a security interest in its natural gas inventory designated for core customers if the value of its AR falls below the amount owed to gas suppliers PGEs figures indicate receivables in excess of payables for each of October November and December with million in receivables and million in payables in December However the security interest is subject to the prior lien of its First Mortgage Indenture under which approximately billion is outstanding not currently in default PGE believes the total collateral available to creditors under that Indenture is from to billion and that creditors under that Indenture would be required to marshal assets in the event they foreclosed on their security meaning that a court would require those creditors who have ample access to security other than these receivables would be required to go against that other collateral and leave the security for the gas suppliers alone US Trust Company will act as collateral agent essentially a trustee The security interest is in place until April per the CPUC order PGE could seek an extension of the CPUC order if necessary The collateral secures obligations for future deliveries only the collateral will not secure PGEs payment obligations for past supplies Suppliers executing the security agreement are committing to negotiate in good faith to sell natural gas to PGE on market terms a refusal to sell to PGE on market terms presumably places a supplier in default of the security agreement and the supplier would loses the benefit of the collateral For as long as the security agreement is in force suppliers executing the security agreement are required to waive provisions in their existing supply agreements permitting them i to suspend performance on account of PGEs failure to demand additional performance assurance ii to demand payment or parent company guarantees iii to declare a default under terminate or suspend performance under its supply agreement in the event of a bankruptcy insolvency appointment of liquidator or failure to pay debts as the become due no supplier is required to waive rights with respect to deliveries prior to the date of the security agreement PGE will be required to deliver weekly reports on the value of its receivables at the end of the preceding week Risks Essentially Enrons choice is A execute the security agreement get the benefit of the security for future deliveries under existing commitments and any new deals we enter into and subject ourselves to restrictions on our ability to refuse new deals or to exercise our rights under existing commitments or B refuse to execute the agreement and remain unsecured yet free of the restrictions and limits that the agreement will place upon us If we sign the agreement we will be a secured creditor to the extent of PGEs obligations covered by this agreement If not we will be an unsecured creditor potentially behind all of the suppliers that did sign the agreement This is assuming that this arrangement survives any bankruptcy of PGE its reasonable to assume that it will Signing the security agreement does give Enron security for PGEs payment for future deliveries of gas under existing contracts Should Enron decide to enter into new deals for additional volumes PGEs payment obligations would also be secured However Enron will be required to negotiate in good faith to supply PGE on market terms PGE has stated that this means that Enron will have to supply PGE in a manner consistent with our dealings with PGE over the past year This probably requires Enron to enter into new deals and means that Enron will not have complete discretion in deciding whether to enter into new deals if Enron wants to keep the benefit of the collateral if Enron refuses to enter into a new deal with PGE PGE may have cause to terminate the security agreement as to Enron The security agreement requires Enron to waive certain rights under its supplier agreements including the right to declare a default upon a PGE bankruptcy as long as the security agreement is in place This could limit our flexibility to deal with our overall exposure to PGE across contracts and affiliates in the event of a meltdown There can be no guarantee that the courts would require the creditors under the First Mortgage Bond to marshal assets this means that suppliers signing the security agreement may still end up subordinated to those creditors The security agreement is governed by California law and suppliers are required to submit to the jurisdiction of California courts This means any dispute under these agreements will be decided by a California judge Please call me at X if you have any

Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our directowned ventures I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in CypressAcadian Bonne Terre Vastar ventures
