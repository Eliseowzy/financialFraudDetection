coverage issue posed by NEPCO Our confidential approach to this policy is in jeopardy as more and more people are creating a need to know and the traffic on this topic internally and externally has

the issue any further Please advise if you concur On this same subject I have received a request from Michelle Cash to notify our insurers of a potential age discrimination claim EEOC has made an inquiry which means according to Michelle that they have received a complaint and want information I have discussed with our broker and they recommend based upon review of the reporting provisions in the policy that we file a report of a potential claim with underwriters I do not have the all facts nor do I have copies of any of any documents however understand that this arises from the

Newest ASAP from Littler Mendelson Please respond Forwarded by Richard VincentNAEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject FW Newest ASAP from Littler Mendelson Mike According to a recent decision by the Washington Supreme Court a supervisor can be held personally liable for jobrelated discrimination or harassment We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine if our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like this The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company were covered but heshe names only the supervisor personally would the Enron insurance decline coverage By copy to Dick Vincent I am asking him to confirm this issue with our insurance program If coverage exists then should we document something in the policy to specifically cover this new form of employment liability unique to Washington State David H Lund Jr Assistant General Counsel National Energy Production Corporation North Creek Parkway N Bothell WA Fax or Original Message From Notestine Kerry mailto mailtomailto Sent Monday April AM To Subject Newest ASAP from Littler Mendelson I am sending you our most recent ASAP Our ASAPs are our summaries of recent developments in employment matters This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court in which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination This ruling relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual supervisors are not personally liable for such acts Similarly individual supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act It may be prudent for employers with workers in Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course and scope of their

upon ENAs reported value of approximately The prorata credit for months assuming a sale date would be Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal Gathering these values within Enron normally requires to days We use these same values in the allocation system Unless the value change is significant the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted If we internally adjust your allocation midyear we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program As you know the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel We have not tried this before however I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENAs allocation all the other operating entities would want to resubmit their revised values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment In view of the time required this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron In view of the relatively small numbers I doubt that Corp would entertain this proposition either however we can approach them if you wish Original Message From Redmond Brian Sent Tuesday October AM To Clayton Paul Coffey Jr Jim Azore Jacquelyn Cc Whiting Greg Gruesen Karen Helton Susan Koehler Anne C Kitchen Louise Bouillion James L Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Paul Please let me know how much of the insurance premium is being allocated to the approx MM of HPL assets This charge is effectively a cost of capital and should be reallocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp Regards Brian Original Message From Clayton Paul Sent Tuesday October AM To Redmond Brian Coffey Jr Jim Azore Jacquelyn Cc Whiting Greg Gruesen Karen Helton Susan Koehler Anne C Kitchen Louise Bouillion James L Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Brian This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage Values are adjusted annually at renewal The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured In the event of a significant divestiture underwriters may consider a refund however the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enrons values as a whole Additionally Enrons adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures At renewal North Americas revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enrons overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron Regards Paul Original Message From Redmond Brian Sent Monday October PM To Coffey Jr Jim Clayton Paul Azore Jacquelyn Cc Whiting Greg Gruesen Karen Helton Susan Koehler Anne C Kitchen Louise Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Paul Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets for the second half of and the balance

Gas Storage value and on the Bammel Lease value of should not be needed Jackie Please remove these amounts from the ENAHPL Plan Original Message From Clayton Paul Sent Monday October PM To Coffey Jr Jim Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Jim As discussed for the purposes of the Insurance Budget we will delete the Bammel Lease property values of We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund However as respects asset divestitures insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience However if we are successful in receiving a credit we will refund the premium I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets Regards Original
