Original Message From Smith Will Sent Tuesday August AM To Semperger Cara Bentley Corry Poston David Venkataswami Vishwanatha Subject RE More on the Region Choices for Path Cut Cara We store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single EnPower Region That means that we can only map California to one of R R and R Are you intending the regions within Path Confirmation to represent a group of EnPower Regions If so we will need to make a database change to store those groupings I expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a Global database change Thanks Will Original Message From Semperger Cara Sent Monday August PM To Bentley Corry Poston David Smith Will Venkataswami Vishwanatha Subject More on the Region Choices for Path Cut Good Afternoon I do want the regions to understand Enpower Regions but at the same time not be so specific to the user Here is the breakdown that I would want California R R and R Northwest R Enpower calls it MidColumbia but many more delivery points than Just Mid Columbia are contained within it and I dont want to list them all in the region choice or confuse the useres further by them looking for something in the northwest that is not MidColumbia WSCCSR Rockies RA WSCCNR Please also see my notes below on the existing system I am happy to provide any further explanation you would like Cara Original Message From Smith Will Sent Monday August PM To Semperger Cara Subject RE Testing PSW and Path confirmation Cara It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower This is the same table that is used in many of our reports Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPowers list of regions Vish tells me that California equates to all of NP SP ZP Also he is unable to resolve Northwest Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list Also as an aside I took a look at the West Discussion Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows Hour Ahead RealTime Region eg Montana MARKETER WSCC NW SW FED Utility This is why I want preset regions right now they are user defined and a mess Date Path Cuts I think the best way is to have the sort selection as it is in the new system by date primarily and

rerunning the date of June as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date PreSchedule Workspace I tried to open the sheet PVJUNELIMITED and got this error Access violation at address Read of address I could not save close or do anything I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet and had closed the COB sheet When I reopened the PVJUNELIMITED sheet it was completely blank This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet Error checking The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal that was put in the market deal number area It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buyresale This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present but the routing error check mentioned it in rows where the deal number was not present Can the sheet be made to understand that a buyresale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell I also got just Error with no explanation of what the error was for rows and Rows and has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream both identified as Portland General System on the sheet Rows I see no errors apparent My second PV sheet gave me routing error Error with no explanation on rows The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export I changed all rows to X and still got the routing error with no explanation I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection Could it be that the system already detects routes File PVJUNELIMITEDpsc Path

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for I only want to see the following California Northwest WSCCN WSCCS Rockies If I need to provide more explanation on this I am happy to do so The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete and will be cumbersome for realtime and settlements to use These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done just over a minute Users will percieve this as something broken I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut I will hand this off to them very soon Overall Findings I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue but the functionality looks really good My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from X date previous the records are in lotus and from X date forward they are in the new system Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both Please let me know anything else that I need to do and when I may test again Thanks Cara

data The original format was based off of Corrys suggestion Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs However I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR POD and firmness for the transmission deal Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points We will resolve the physical nonphysical in the next release as well as add a Check for Errors button Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming We will work on it right away but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible Path Confirm Sorting Are Global ID and Tag sorting just not in an order that you expect Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons If you need the values sorted by numbers putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market If the delivery points are different should we require a transmission path record I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications There is currently no plan for including those features in this release Our goal for the first

Workspace TestingJune target date Good Afternoon I have created PSW documents for all of my regions for June here are my findings today In PreSchedule Workspace What worked I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will When running the Confirm function I was able to print the error log which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors The routing speed was still very good What needs improvement The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production The rockies sheet alone took hours to upload the Mid C sheet took over two hours I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue I will continue uploading today and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm I got this error message ERRORAccess violation at address EDE in module PreSchedWSexe Read of address We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet I used another half hour fixing the errors and rerunning the sheet A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs nonphysical Everything shows nonphysical Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points Question Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now the weakness with having the path show from transmission etc is it does not give the PORPOD or the firmness of the transmission The way a path should look is like this VEAPSTPVWW O FWALCTWWMEAD O MNFEPMINEVP the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be VEAPSWALCNEVP This is incomplete information OR would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells Instead of APS put APSTPVWW and in the OASIS cell put F In Path Confirmation What worked I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them The save takes too long but it worked What still needs work I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number Would a different tag logic work instead of PWX Tag show PWX TAG Some marketers use letters for tags The cell with the path in the expanded view must autosize to contain all of the path The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passedUpstreamSupplyETransTransTransMarketDownstreamRight now some run together The path cut needs work it is cumbersome unclear on some entry requirements and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it This app seems like guesswork New path needs work as well The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field like in build route selection not a first letter drop down list The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical It should mimic the deal entry list The new record should be three tiered Supply first then marketboth mandatory entry then transmission as an optional third To allow a Supply without a Market record is going to create many problems How are these new records going to be routed Also our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut I will continue testing tomorrow the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work We are getting there I am very encouraged Cara

thanks for your input Regarding the new issues with path confirmation most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily Vish is already working on them Concerning the colors there are three sets of colors representing market supply and transmission I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application Regarding PreSchedule adding print capability to the error log should be no problem Also adding check for errors functionality will be done Concerning Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips either term or schedule for a deal but the strips have different delivery points The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use I will confirm this We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name I may have both the

days but if you have more please send it Thanks Will Original Message From Semperger Cara Sent Friday July PM To Atta Asem Smith Will Cc Bentley Corry Poston David Williams III Bill Subject Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace Path Confirmation and Path Cut software I am working in the target date of June th Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group Once COB is added we will have pretty much an average daily volume Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C File MidCJunepsc In Preschedule Workspace I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported and ran a total of lines into the Path confirmation The rest of the sheet was all bookouts and so I marked them for routing only I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up as the lists can be long and I have to make notes on what is wrong Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet instead of cleaning up afterwards Routing functionality question If we change a delivery point in scheduling BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point These types of deals route now I would like to duplicate that existing functionality I did get an error message on those lines Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points Please see the attached sheet there is a batch of them line thru but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered The routing speed is EXCELLENT One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower The megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging My Palo data was corrupted so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower short name to something that is workable I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name In Path Confirmation The early sorting looks good things look very versatile and useable Yesterday I identified several problems The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp The Alias list is not functioning properly The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch not pulling up each deal line by line Today I am finding the following When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point These fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur I am not allowed to sort by Global ID even though global IDs are populated there My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section no globals go in another section and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over minutes This is to long to be practical in production for real time I would like to see this time go to seconds or less All paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked even though none have been cut yet The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work but that is a little thing Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable Variations of the beige color are easier to read The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first and then populate the cut This is a bit different than we discussed My plan is to take this as far as I can and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final tweaking I also cannot sort by tag number We need that

in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets rearranged to meet t he new guidelines The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R What worked I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact I had previ ously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of Starting On June PaloVerdeDay of week Mask ActivatedReport Changes activated A check of deals actually scheduled vs build route results showed that all d eals were extracted correctly from Enpower Because I am working on closed dates a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until produ ction We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarn ation of Build route The data extracted should be read only time stamped and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previous ly extracted data The improvement we are expecting to see is the app shou ld not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow We st Light Load currently does this in Start view but not Active view Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately exec ute the sort function on a single criteria at a time Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result Routing deals Will had deleted all routes for June th starting me with a clean slate I made every path be for DAY I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH as the real time position manager does not seem to be functi oning in TESTP The routing appeared to take minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time This time is minutes longe r than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now The error li st gave me a row by row description of what did not route a very useful to ol OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed I had difficulty checking the routing results as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred Local Enpower Scheduling kept s tarting up in I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server but was able to in Terminal Server The results there were very encou raging Most routing was done and a spot check of deals shows that they we re routed properly The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a us er error of deal number duplication in the sheet This is consistent with w hat I would expect I will further evaluate routing ability with our more c omplicated paths later This routing was very easy a large point with on p eak non shaped deals only Things I did not expect that I liked When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler s sheet What does not appear to be working at this time The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up pr operly in routing Path Confirmation The running time appeared to be over one hour for one s heet only rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmati on This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production Also many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported and I canno t find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation When the path confirmation task was finished the application simply froze The status bar was no longer visible leading me to believe that it was done however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined furthe r My conclusions The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production the copypaste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point and appears to be blowi ng up the app No data was visible for June th even after the PSW ran thr ough its import function Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing Thanks Cara

as an outside counterparty in scheduling When the desk got changed to LTWMGMT West Portfolio it should have flipped to an interdesk which does not show up in scheduling Evidently it didnt If Enpower wont automatically recognize the change in counterparty correctly I guess we will have to kill the deals and rebook them rather than change the desk Let me know what you think Thanks Monica To Monica

<30308967.1075863310544.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,will.smith@enron.com,2001-07-13 15:15:27,RE Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace Path Confirmation and Path Cut software Cc Bill NonPrivilegedpst Cara First of all thanks for your input Regarding the new issues with path confirmation most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily Vish is already working on them Concerning the colors there are three sets of colors representing market supply and transmission I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application Regarding PreSchedule adding print capability to the error log should be no problem Also adding check for errors functionality will be done Concerning Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips either term or schedule for a deal but the strips have different delivery points The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use I will confirm this We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name I may have both the code and description displayed I believe Corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records Corry can you confirm this The information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days but if you have more please send it Thanks Will Original Message From Semperger Cara Sent Friday July PM To Atta Asem Smith Will Cc Bentley Corry Poston David Williams III Bill Subject Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace Path Confirmation and Path Cut software I am working in the target date of June th Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group Once COB is added we will have pretty much an average daily volume Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C File MidCJunepsc In Preschedule Workspace I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported and ran a total of lines into the Path confirmation The rest of the sheet was all bookouts and so I marked them for routing only I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up as the lists can be long and I have to make notes on what is wrong Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet instead of cleaning up afterwards Routing functionality question If we change a delivery point in scheduling BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point These types of deals route now I would like to duplicate that existing functionality I did get an error message on those lines Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points Please see the attached sheet there is a batch of them line thru but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered The routing speed is EXCELLENT One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower The megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging My Palo data was corrupted so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower short name to something that is workable I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name In Path Confirmation The early sorting looks good things look very versatile and useable Yesterday I identified several problems The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp The Alias list is not functioning properly The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch not pulling up each deal line by line Today I am finding the following When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point These fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur I am not allowed to sort by Global ID even though global IDs are populated there My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section no globals go in another section and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over minutes This is to long to be practical in production for real time I would like to see this time go to seconds or less All paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked even though none have been cut yet The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work but that is a little thing Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable Variations of the beige color are easier to read The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first and then populate the cut This is a bit different than we discussed My plan is to take this as far as I can and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final tweaking I also cannot sort by tag number We need that Thank you all for your work on this it is really looking good I have to schedule on Monday but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks Cara
