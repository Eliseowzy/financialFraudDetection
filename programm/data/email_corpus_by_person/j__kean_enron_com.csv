<9590228.1075859391327.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,j..kean@enron.com,2001-12-05 11:39:00,FW Non US Locations Cc Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject FW Non US Locations A few more details Again most of the EGA companies ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities Through further research we found a few more that dont totally fit that mold Elektro Electricidad e Servicos SA in Brazil of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities EPE Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris SC Ltda aka Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a direct ownership interest and one Board vote Energia Ltd another Brazil operation is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of Feb Again this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject RE Non US Locations Steve As stated earlier many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership We can assure you that for the most part you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ie Corp ENA EES etc There are a few however that may be incorrectly categorized as follows EA ECT Non US Payroll Company there is no such entity but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA Enron Capital Trade Resources in London UK may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited EBS Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd actually comes up to Corp through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance EEOS Enron Engineering Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe EES Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities ServicesLimbach companies EGA Heres where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with complicated multilayers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp ownership As you know all of the old subsets ie APACHI CALME etc have gone away and everything international is now EGA To the best of our knowledge all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed Following are the exceptions andor unusual organizational structure that should be noted Electricidad Enron de Guatemala SA actually reports up through ENA San Juan Gas Company Inc in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp owned Enron American del Sur SA is an Enron CorpEnron Transportation Services entity No entity called Enron Singapore more than likely Enron Capital Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company EIM No Stadacona Paper Company but it is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp as the general partner and a list of Limited Partners including ENA Enron Corp and a nonEnron entity Salomon Brothers Holding Company Inc ENW Enron Net Works LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp company EWC The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp which is owned by Smith Street Land Co an Enron Corp company but many of the names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas SA no Enron Wind UK no Enron Wind India but regardless they are all part of the EWCEREC family GLOBAL These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration Production Inc which is owned by Enron Corp but one has indirect outside ownership EP Enron Oil Gas India Ltd for instance is owned by Enron Asst Holdings which is owned by Enron Finance Partners which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one nonEnron entity Zephyrus Investments LLC with a small interest Again I hope this information is helpful For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance Hardie Angus H Davis Vice President Corporate Secretary Department Enron Corp SubsidiariesAffiliates Davis Hardie Original Message From Kean Steven J Sent Tuesday December PM

<23734580.1075858875013.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,j..kean@enron.com,2001-08-17 17:55:53,Recommendations and updateI know you are getting an impossible volume of advice right now b ut thats not going to stop me from piling on a little more I believe everything we have been saying we have the best business mode l we are making great money we are growing we are addressing our issues and we have all of our capabilities intact We are poised for even greater growth Even so we will not be able to fight off the negatives on our st ock and on our reputation right now Our problem is not a problem about ge tting the message out Part of the problem we cant do anything about almost all equities hav e suffered this year But part of our problem the part we can do somethin g about is that we are faced with too many bad but true or at least plau sible allegations that we have to deal with every time we try to tell our story These current circumstances are not necessarily bad I think we c an use them as a great opportunity to drive some overdue changes But no a mount of communication or spin will work right now We have to directly address the issues The difficult allegations we face include Creative or aggressive accounting both in reporting and deal structuring Black box reporting Overhyping of the stock or the prospects for unproven businesses A near mercenary culture which encourages organizations to hide problems u ntil those problems have become very big discourages cooperation and team work and drives off people who demand at least a modicum of civility in th eir work environment I have some answers First I would hold our actions to the standard we apply to everything else the market standard We should do the economic ally rational thing in every transaction and business and let the chips fal l where they may Instead of tying ourselves in a knot about managing earn ings or write downs or avoiding an asset sale because its on the books for more than the market we should just make the rational economic decision Second I would open up our reporting Make it as transparent as the an alysts want indeed set a new standard for transparency and integrity I know we are looking at these things and have been for some time I also re alize that at some levels of disclosure we risk disclosing positions Im just saying we should drive right up to the edge Third I think IR should be all about the facts disclosing facts and co rrecting misunderstandings I would not spin in this function Our audi ence is too sophisticated If we make the economically rational decisions over and over the stock price will come along We have lost credibility b y overhyping businesses we havent proven yet and its hard to see why we d o it To get early credit in the stock price Id rather wait To prove that we are a growth company I think a track record of growth and a ratio nal and circumspect discussion of our opportunities will take care of that I want us to be a company which is bold in its business moves not in its approach to analysts or in its accounting The reputation I would like to have with investors is that we never overstate we never dissappoint and t hat we can always be trusted I am not being critical of our team We hav e the best most organized hardest working and most effective IR team in the business I am just concerned that we have sent them speeding down the wrong path Similarly I am not critical of our accounting organization We have the finest accounting organization in the industry They need to be the best in order to get sensible accounting rules and interpretations t o accurately reflect the results of our unique and innovative business Th ey need to minimize our tax exposures etc I am not arguing that anyone ha s done anything wrong or ineffectively I simply believe that it is time t o reassess how we do these things and I dont consider my organization to be exempt from that same reassessment Finally our culture As I said the other day there may be a relativel y small number of individuals who are commercially successful well paid r egularly promoted who have little or no respect for their coworkers or othe r human beings in general When others see them rewarded it matters not a t all what we say about our values Dealing with a few people directly wil l send a message that spreads like wildfire through the organization Addi tionally compensation structures and a PRC process which explicitly reward s teamwork and which includes broader representation than just the commerc ial groups will go a very long way toward changing the level of civility i n the organization I hope its clear to you that I love this place I have poured my heart and soul into it It is the finest organization I have ever been part of Like everyone I have had some time to reflect lately I have recommitte d myself to this place and to your leadership Part of that recommitment w ill be my concerted effort to make things even better

US Locations A few more details Again most of the EGA companies ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities Through further research we found a few more that dont totally fit that mold Elektro Electricidad e Servicos SA in Brazil of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities EPE Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris SC Ltda aka Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a direct ownership interest and one Board vote Energia Ltd another Brazil operation is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of Feb Again this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject RE Non US Locations Steve As stated earlier many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership We can assure you that for the most part you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ie Corp ENA EES etc There are a few however that may be incorrectly categorized as follows EA ECT Non US Payroll Company there is no such entity but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA Enron Capital Trade Resources in London UK may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited EBS Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd actually comes up to Corp through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance EEOS Enron Engineering Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe EES Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities ServicesLimbach companies EGA Heres where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with complicated multilayers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp ownership As you know all of the old subsets ie APACHI CALME etc have gone away and everything international is now EGA To the best of our knowledge all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed Following are the exceptions andor unusual organizational structure that should be noted Electricidad Enron de Guatemala SA actually reports up through ENA San Juan Gas Company Inc in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp owned Enron American del Sur SA is an Enron CorpEnron Transportation Services entity No entity called Enron Singapore more than likely Enron Capital Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company EIM No Stadacona Paper Company but it is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp as the general partner and a list of Limited Partners including ENA Enron Corp and a nonEnron entity Salomon Brothers Holding Company Inc ENW Enron Net Works LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp company EWC The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp which is owned by Smith Street Land Co an Enron Corp company but many of the names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas SA no Enron Wind UK no Enron Wind India but regardless they are all part of the EWCEREC family GLOBAL These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration Production Inc which is owned by Enron Corp but one has indirect outside ownership EP Enron Oil Gas India Ltd for instance is owned by Enron Asst Holdings which is owned by Enron Finance Partners which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one nonEnron entity Zephyrus Investments LLC with a small interest Again I hope this information is helpful For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track Let my group know if we can be

Subject Tavel advisory France I thought you and Jim might like this The following advice for American travellers going to France was compiled from information provided by the US State Department the CIA the US Chamber of Commerce the Food and Drug Administration the Centres for Disease Control and some very expensive spy satellites that the French dont know about It is intended as a guide for American travellers only General Overview France is a mediumsized foreign country situated in the continent of Europe It is an important member of the world community though not nearly as important as it thinks It is bounded by Germany Spain Switzerland and some smaller nations of no particular importance and with not very good shopping France is a very old country with many treasures such as the

responsibility for Enron Corp Security resides in our business controls organization You can contact this organization through their website security by phone or by email mailto John Brindle Senior Director Business Controls leads this organization Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions or to report security threats We have two areas to update you on changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center and other facilities where practical As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center US drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identification Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card Adult visitors without a valid photo ID US drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identification will not be allowed access to the Enron Center Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor signed into a visitors log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor and escorted to their appointment At the conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor the visitor badge collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines report suspicious activity to Security phone do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open allowing tail

obtain increased guard personnel and equipment we expect the inconvenience to decrease We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes we have two important recommendations While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan Indonesia Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Georgia and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled In addition we recommend that planned travel to Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank Jordan Lebanon Saudi Arabia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered For nonUS citizens traveling in the United States corporate security recommends that you carry documentation There have been several recent reports of nonUS citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding US domestic flights As a result we suggest that all nonUS citizens who currently reside in the United States and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status carry their passport Form I and Form I at all times We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of to carry hisher registration documentation with them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident Card Form I card Employment Authorization Card Border Crossing Card or a Temporary Resident Card Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for registration documentation but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by email as appropriate

addition we recommend that planned travel to Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank Jordan Lebanon Saudi Arabia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered For nonUS citizens traveling in the United States corporate security recommends that you carry documentation There have been several recent reports of nonUS citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding US domestic flights As a result we suggest that all nonUS citizens who currently reside in the United States and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status carry their passport Form I and Form I at all times We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of to carry hisher registration documentation with them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident Card Form I card Employment Authorization Card Border Crossing Card or a Temporary Resident Card Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for

Subject pm Update Emergency The situation continues to be stable CLHB has reinitated LPG operation s to LaPaz but continue their inspection TR will not reinitiate gas or c rude export operations until we have completed our inspection We have for med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection It could take as long as hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority co ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the altipl ano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors throughou t the system have been advised and are on alert Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE t he regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute ene rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in spection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L aPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to th e volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed w ith the message We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s afely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne cessary The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales a local revol utionary tied to the coca trade is behind the action Morales has had co ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so we re still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry o r if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro w Their agenda is national theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past proba bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold The po litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int erests looking to fill the leadership void Were watching this situation closely The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days once were comfortable with the operational si tuation well discuss a longerterm solution Steve Forwarded by Steve HopperTRANSREDES on PM Steve Hopper PM To Peter E W nronXGate cc Subject Emergency At pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG li ne in the Altiplano km from out SicaSica station Our OSSA II crude ex ports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode Th e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediat e threat neutralized However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last day s of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw ork The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go o ut in LaPaz within the next few hours the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the sit uation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of a n organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations th roughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perf orm vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our people complete the overall plan I will keep you posted as things develop Steve

get them exactly the way they were written The note is long consider pr inting it Vikas File AAProgramCommentsdoc Comments from MBA Class We need to reconcile the difference between ENEs salaries vs competit ors and other Houston companies We need better guidance in the rotation selection Ive seen lot of go od people being screwed because choosing a bad area to work due to lack of information Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not the Program itsel f is staffed in a very amateur manner There are a few really good people but for the most part it is just not professionally run Calls unanswered lots of passing the buck and general disorganization If they have resources they do a poor job of communicating them Whi le we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves there should be an a ctive effort to point us to those resources Compensation The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being l ocked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance At the very least this is a serious oversight PRC Really doesnt work Not an apple to apples comparison Heavil y dependent on whenwhere you rotated I could care less about Enrons reputation I tried paying my student loans with reputation but they only accepted cash How much money can I make at this place assuming the stock price doesnt double every few month s in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay my compensation Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in term s of the PRC where before Enron was penalizing the have issues classific ation of the PRC now it feels like they are trying to get rid of of th e pool Reinforcing the first paragraph Offer of salary is cloaked and we dont know where we can end up I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the h ead office As a result the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false e xpectations And obviously when those expectations are not met we all know the consequences The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much high er base Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against I s it really Wall Street and consulting If so Id like to see the names o f the firms New York is not that expensive that the well theyre in New York excuse covers all discrepancies It feels like we must be benchmarki ng against second or third tier MBA recruiters Theres a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a s ecure established money making division in order to guarantee a average o r above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom brackets and not be fired That goes against the long term reputation of Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others ro tating but do not expect to get displaced by a st rotation associate that is placed by the AA pool Assignment of st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was more of an analyst function than it was an associate function Why cant alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the in coming candidate Manage expectationsdont need to hear about year old trader and Louise Kitchens rise to fame with Enron Onlinecreates an expectation t hat those are more common occurrences than they really are It doesnt feel like theres a lot to do in all areas nonetheless so mething between and new associates coming in these fall First why that many Second do they know what they are getting into The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up for the disparity but given the declining stock value lack of meaningful rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the progra m this is becoming a much bigger issue Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea wha t the upside looks like Working for beans in year is ok if years ar e excellent We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus aft er the program is over Salary well below market base salary and value of optionsbonus e ven if they bring us up to the offers which are rumored to be under m arket we have year or more experience with the class coming in and will be paid the same amount Lack of quality rotations cuts in EBS EES ect Level of responsibility is well below expectationsmaturity level Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top BSchools Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting but also compared to specialties brand management etc that are at the lower end of the M BA scale It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not i ndexed by location Other energy companies here in town even pay more The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and no t carrots There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of a signing bonus months after the start date If the Program is truly s pecial people should not be forced to repay anythingEnron should deliver w hat they advertise and people will stay The month lock up period sugge sts a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associ ate and not an improvement in the Program How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual pe rformance levels Ive got no clue but Im wondering why it such a big sec ret The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rota tions as Enron implies For example if you take a rotation in an area you know nothing about you will lose in the PRC because you are still learnin g the job Similarly if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation y ou will be rewarded a PRC time There are too many associates and too few analysts Too many associ ate rotations become exercises in finding something to do Too often asso ciates think to themselves I remember doing this several years ago as an u ndergrad why am I doing this again They should present the program for what it is an internal labor poo l where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available and who they know The Program does not match people with jobs and should make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs etc upon entry into t he program This is not because they want Associates to have choice but r ather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors I dont k now what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not k eeping up Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the progra m When a person who didnt get into Enron but got into a competitor makes materially more money from the start people start believing they have jus t been sold a lot of hype Not enough development during rotations even associates who end up learning a lot dont necessarily enjoy their rotations because they dont f eel part of the team Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your fir st rotation is a moral buster as well Additionally it can waste a lot of time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have no interest in Compensation many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower ba se and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised l arge equity based compensation Also it was very difficult to find out wh at full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process Most wrongl y believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus oth er leading MBA avenues How much money do people at Enron make assuming th e stock price performs Great Okay Poor Responsibility when you are getting recruited you always here the L ouise Kitchen John Arnold and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal We need to stop doing that Enrons slowing growth rate and failure in e verything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we look more and more like a large corporation The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out I f this is true why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in f ewer higher quality associates from the start the process of weeding out leaves everyone with a bad feeling More importantly you probably lose m ore good people then you realize Trading trading trading On MBA campus visits Enron gives the imp ression that there are lots of corporate development MA finance and ot her similar assignments available at Enron The reality seems that if you are not interested in trading for a living you are not on the companys ma in commercial track any longer Finding a Rotation Information difficult to get it is all networkin g This is fine but I dont consider the AA progrram a resource in this a rea at all If no one else does we should cut any expenses they are incurr ing for rotation placement The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale You can reward the high performers without penalizing the good performers Recently the word has gotten around that the top and the next of the PRC group got very large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses This distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger numb er of unhappy people I find it interesting that Enron chooses to adopt a business mode l based upon freemarket economics and pride itself on its intellectual capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial serv ices player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence In sel ecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point I find it paradoxical h owever that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be desc ribed as socialistic and below market In a labor market where intellectu al capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive advantage in the form of this asset I can only believe that Enron is posit ioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J Aron Morgan Stanl ey Dynegy El Paso etc decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on En ron is to higher this intellectual capital Without griping I feel if not hing else workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talen ts we possess In our sales pitch we are told that Enron benchmarks pay against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a cand le to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package which leaves me bi tter that the sales pitch was shallow fell short or was deliberately misg uided Part of the problem from an Associates perspective stems from Enr on promising the moon and then falling short on delivery Like a company t hat fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market punishment for such a s hortfall is swift and severe I truly believe Enron is setting itself up f or such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics an d socialistic patronage I have come to notice that more and more departmen ts are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the A ssociate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months Fu rther many desks once happy with the performance of the Associate ask fo r the option to retain the Associate However no effort is made to comp ensate the Associate for essentially giving up the optionality embedded i n a rotational program In fact many choosing to stay within a group have made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time they have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead o pting to join a unit full time By removing the ability of business units to promote a worker until conclusion of the month period hard workin g goodfit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would see m to be a natural fit for a fulltime position and the chance to alleviate a significant source of discontentCOMPENSATION which could be addressed through the immediate promotion to the Manager level By allowing for prom otion Associates could earn enhanced compensation and department heads co uld address hiring needs Rather Associates leave a unit disgruntled fee ling they are marking time in other units potentially passing up an altern ative that may be of great interest Additionally a number of Commercial units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are in their third or fourth rotation so as to retain a call option on an em ployee that has run out of rotation alternatives This practice CANNOT be in the best interest of the Desks the Program or for that matter Enron By pigeonholing employees in this matter the significance and importance o f rotations is greatly diminished as is our work experience This is just ludicrous Department heads arent looking to hire externally because of the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade Rather they are trying to plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary Again rather than pay a competitive performancebased wage Enron has adopted a tightfiste d socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses Ultimately this will l ead to people seeking to rotate out of Enron for the compensation the mar ket will bare I think AA provides an excellent opportunity to find the department that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates than for regular employees We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go I doubt many of the guys who went to NY had this We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce Salaries Not in line with market Mentors Not encouraged throughout the organization Recruiting Disorganized not enough student focus trying to compete with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries sometimes unprofess ional conduct rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and gave message you are not good enough Summer Intern Program Not well coordinated Rotation Length Keep flexibility mos sometimes too short other t imes too long disincents management to include Associates in longer term meatier projects When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited Overall Enron has a great group of people to work with Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds ethnicity and natio nalities within the company Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere Overall Enron has an excellent overall company image I do not have too many comments My main problem with the last team w as that they were extremely rigid rigid start date rigidity in assigning groups etc Old group did oneway dialogues they would not even listen The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen these are two thi ngs I feel are most important in running such program Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friend s that graduated with me from my business school They wanted still want to work for Enron I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a res ponse I believe she left Enron I then contacted Patricia Payton Several emails phone calls and still havent heard from her Its frustrating dea ling with the HR dept PRC is not a trusted mechanism Few people in the program understand it fully no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings and no one bel ieves the results are truly equitable Politics appears to play as much of a role as performance if not more so in determining rankings Further groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r anked people For as much as individuals success depends upon this rankin g and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be that policy is incredibly inconsistent We are under market for compensation everyone knows this regardles s of what the program people say It is common knowledge that at least Rel iant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and b onus The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incomin g participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries fl at and was not well received obviously Rotation placement service is not very useful The best way to find a good rotation remains through networking The experience talent and character of the associate pool continue to be excellent Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing Comeraderie a mong the class is widespread and genuine The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right d irection Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain in ternal communication and networking within each associate class and to crea te new networks between individual associate classes Efforts by individua l associates to affect this have not been supported Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered particularly as rotation time approaches This would facilitate informal d iscussion about opportunities and business unit activity Additionally it would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rota tions and introduce those interested to potential future managers Compensation is clearly an issue Whether the compensation gap exist s in reality or it only exists in perception there is a widespread belief that Enron is undercompensating associates relative to both other firms in the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets a re employed This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severel y underwater options Base salary should be addressed Again whether perception or reality associates are concerned about selecting rotations in groups that are not making money The belief is tha t bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units The refore it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable gro up regardless of the skill development it may offer The mandatory eighteenmonth service period before eligibility for pr omotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers What happened to the AA publication There is no source available that provides a history of individual as sociates who have rotated through specific jobs It would be very benefici al to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for firsthand information on business units of interest My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the respons ibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into t he group Once in I know of several people including myself that get a wh ole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations prior to joining that group Furthermore I believe that Associates get w ork that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degr ee This is very frustrating because once your in your in and you cant g et out for months On top of that you get PRC reviews based on work tha t was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assess ment can be made Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyon e But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were up front with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate In addition it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very very poorly by their new groups This has not been the case for me but I know people th at have voiced these thoughts and opinions so I am speaking for them inca se they are too nervous to put it into writing That is about it I would like to see some education come out of the Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron as well as som e greater insight to particular groups and the expectations When Enron recruited us it was so different from what it is now So many diverse opportunities were out there Now Enron is heading towards a pure trading house It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rota tion out of trading But you dont need an MBA to be a trader In fact A ssociates often work for analysts on the trading side and we dont have an y special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the tradi ng side It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about getting the n ext rotation at El Paso A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly and six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first and then make meaningful contributions Some people think it is worthwhile to groom Associates even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts who are supposed to be there longer It is sometimes difficult for Associates to g et meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competit ors The companys direction has changed drastically from the one I interv iewed for in November some of these strategies seem shortsighted and in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in th e energy business in the long term specifically The stated strategy of exiting all generation exploration and trans portation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the compa ny and earns us a banking multiple on the street Also with additional pl ayers entering the gas and power markets in a major way how can we expect to continue to grow and maintain our current market share Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures including Azurix Enron International Dabhol EBS and EES The failures of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not b een totally priced in to our stock price Bottom line there does not appe ar to be any large areas of growth within the company Pay When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from to dollars more to do the same job it doesnt make you feel very intelligent to be working here Additionally when I accepted this positi on I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and what the determinants are of the annual bonus What I have heard through the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to beli eve during recruiting Not having any assistance and having attended a top East coast school I am almost dollars in debt I was counting o n the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I w orked as an engineer in manufacturing I dont see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analys ts and Associates It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salari es but it is also a waste of years of experience in the case of Associat es It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the P rogram gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units Be certai n the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associ ate If you look at AA as human capital we at Enron are very long in bac kground experience and knowledge The AA Program is Regulation using En ron terminology from rotation assignments to payments I see pretty logic al the consequences a lot of inefficiencies waste of energy the lack of objectivity poor motivation or even frustration in general performance is far away from excellent Add some flexibility to the Program let the peop le choose their rotations and move without restrictions Let them also nego tiate working conditions salaries and career path with the business unit PRC is unfair I consider offensive writing in a maximum of lines months of accomplishments I dont think a PRC Committee can better assess the performance than the business unit degree evaluations and peers review are ok Rethink the need of a committee and a ranking of AA assig ned to so different business units I feel free to choose for a second rotation I like the way you can a pproach a new business unit introduce yourself have an interview and gath ered information about the business and your position Things may change af ter that and you get stacked in that place for at least months Keep allo wing people to search and move freely from HR Make staff more accountable Online based Much like the IT departm ent where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure of with any comments Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Man ager Not communicated at all Tell people that their first rotations are assigned Also not commun icated I wish I had a PRC suggestion but I need to think about it Dont insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money but putting it in a bonus so you dont have to give us raises If you wan t to do that give me the courtesy of being up front about it Some kind of database maybe there is one that I dont know about of openings Would be pretty cool Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors at the least so it is equal Make the development and support of associates a more important crite rion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents The commer cial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely Reduce the size of each incoming class make the program special aga in Right now I cant believe the broad spread in ability and experience in the associate class I guarantee the spread is not that high in other t op tier firms that hire MBAs With the smaller size assign a lead commercial person to a group of associates The lead commercial person a director or VP would keep in touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these groups know when they need a clerk analyst or associate Too often we tr eat analysts clerks and yearold associates with years of experien ce the same This happens way too much The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they want to take and design a plan on how to get them there

POst Article Part Three Traders Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires By Dan Morgan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday August Page A Last of three articles ATLANTA Ever since steamboat captain WP Lay founded Alabama Power Co in to develop electricity along the Coosa River utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose so southerners could have power and light Now a bunch of outsiders who buy and sell electricity but dont have a single retail customer below the MasonDixon line have their sights set on those wires and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration Aided by supercomputers and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nations power grid then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand they want to remove what they contend is a wire curtain around the South That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new federally supervised regional authority The monopoly is the wires and thats where the battles occur said Jeffrey K Skilling who was chief executive of Houstons Enron Corp the largest of the power merchants until he resigned last week The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation In with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid Congress opted for a competitive market The plan was to dismantle longstanding utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand Now these new merchants of power along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world have become strong advocates for a freeflowing national electricity market But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation they are running into resistance from traditional utilities exemplified by Atlantas Southern Co now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities At issue is how fast the federal government in the wake of the California electricity crisis should push for yet more changes Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC recently stocked with President Bushs promarket appointees ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities Those authorities in turn will build new transmission lines do away with bottlenecks set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all Next month the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South according to executives at Southern Co whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia Alabama Mississippi and north Florida Southern Co Chairman H Allen Franklin said in a recent interview will not go blindly into the system proposed by FERC Although unfettered access to Southerns miles of lines might help longdistance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron company officials say it could mean congestion power outages and higher prices for their million retail customers When California was restructured it was thought there would be massive savings Franklin said Well there havent been Building the Power Trade If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity a visit to Houston dispels them In the citys energy alley Enron Corp with annual sales of more than billion last year double those of Texaco is finishing a new floor office building adjacent to its story tower Enrons competitors Dynegy Inc Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy are a few blocks away Duke Energy North American merchant arm of Charlottebased Duke Power has settled in as well And Calpine Corp plans to take over floors of a new story building near Enron These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market which now handles about a quarter of US electricity output But it is still a work in progress fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market the Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas Many did Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast which had long endured high power costs To spur competition California and some northeastern states went further requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers Many states went further still ending their utilities long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity Enron formed in by the merger of two big gaspipeline companies was quick to seize the opportunities Its chairman Kenneth Lay a former official at the Federal Power Commission FERCs precursor during the Nixon administration had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the s As the electricity market began to develop in the early s Lay and Skilling a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets Enron signed its first longterm power contract in Skilling recalls Independent companies that wanted to install gasfired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under longterm contract then sell the electricity back to Enron We started creating forward and futures markets using a lot more financial engineering than was required in other commodity businesses Skilling said By the late s Enron was buying the output of generating plants days weeks months and even years before it was produced using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold During the past five years Enron has been one of the nations fastestgrowing companies Its net income rose percent in the second quarter of this year although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its high of mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity Investors pushed the price still lower after Skillings departure last week Southern Inhospitality Like other merchants Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition But the Southeast remained lessfriendly territory Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation Florida goes so far as to ban outofstate companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas The web of power lines tied to the utilities coal nuclear and gasfired generating plants reaches across states via kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles For Southern Co its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride In it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report Clustered around its borders are Entergy another huge holding company that serves Louisiana Arkansas and parts of Mississippi and Texas Florida Power Light Carolina Power Light Duke Power and the federal governments centralized power giant the Tennessee Valley Authority Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices Prices run percent or more below the national average thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the hightension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels FERC in a series of orders from to required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time The message a former official said was they couldnt use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed planttocustomer systems A November FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the regions utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region FERC investigators cited Southern Cos refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc connect to its transmission lines in Alabama Southern said the added load would cause an areawide stability problem for electric supply In that case FERC denied SkyGens request for relief Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that dayahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southerns territory have become possible But he said Enron has trouble getting longterm transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly Also he said Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southerns grid If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co to Jacksonville Electric thered be zero available Presto said Of the overall situation in the Southeast he said that the utilities give you to percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load retail customers So you have a huge highway thats supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isnt available to the wholesalers Southern Co Chairman Franklin dismissed as unfounded the complaints of the merchants and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Cos lines say they generally have been treated well Robert Johnston president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia MEAG which supplies power to towns took issue with the notion of a wire curtain The market is growing in Georgia he said MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers It also has its own generators producing power at four sites though Southern Co has an interest in all of them Theres not a grassroots interest driving the reforms Franklin said Its the wholesale players While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast though Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year Mirant Corp Southern Cos marketing subsidiary competed in California the Midwest and the North supplementing leaner profits from Southern Cos regulated units Southerns strategy has been clear Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home said Allen Mosher director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association Well Connected for Battle The next move is up to the federal government Next month Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission so that vested interests will not be able to manipulate the use of the transmission system to benefit their own plants Bingamans office said In the House key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa whose state is home to Southern Cos western neighbor Entergy and Rep Joe Barton RTex chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee who has had close ties to the huge coaldependent Texas utility TXU Last week Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L Hebert Jr a Mississippi protg of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott RMiss to handle regulatory and government affairs Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K Armey RTex as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie Associates Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTex the hometown Houston congressman though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay an enthusiast for electricity deregulation can bring to bear Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closeddoor meetings that DeLay sponsored but did not attend could not reach consensus on electricity As a result the energy bill passed by the House on Aug skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability Bushs election and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants Bushs first two appointees to FERC Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck Wood had worked with Enron during a sixyear effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas where Wood headed the states public utility commission Brownell a former Pennsylvania utility regulator won praise from Enron in when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market On July with a majority in tow Wood Brownell and William L Massey a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition tossed out proposals by Southern Co and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations or RTOs It was about time a bomb was dropped Wood said But FERCs action may only have been what power associations Mosher calls the beginning of a long movie Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of highvoltage power lines western propertyrights advocates and state utility regulators Politically wellconnected groups not now regulated by FERC including the TVA rural electric coops and municipal power systems are also wary of new federal powers There are big questions about FERCs role who will determine transmissionline charges should there be federal authority to site power lines should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability said Rep Richard Burr RNC vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners noted that her states three investorowned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines without our approval Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon Smith noted that percent of the states power comes from hydroelectric dams Thats public property she said In Alabama James Sullivan a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Cos affiliate said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding Im opposed to any changes to our electric system in Alabama until I know its going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us he said In the view of Southern Co Chairman Franklin it is still an open question whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires Nonetheless the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to put the genie back in the bottle according to a former FERC official The power merchants readily concur Everybodys paying too much because youve got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities Enrons Presto said Staff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report The Washington Post Company

employee of Enron I have watched the stocks dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance over the last months As Chairman and CEO you are ultimately responsible for everything that goes on in the company Without getting into the potentially criminal and certainly illconceived activities of you and other Enron executives past and present I think you have done little but pay lip service in order to correct things Mr Lay you and the other executives receive very large salaries None of you is hurting for money I think it unconscionable that you and other executives continue to draw a paycheck While employees and others like me have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero you remain wealthy beyond most of our dreams Whats worse you take more from the company every week in the form of pay I realize you havent had a soul in quite sometime But are you so unconcerned with the wellbeing of the people like me who believed in you and worked years and years for you that you feel justified adding insult to injury You have literally ruined the lives of thousands of people Your employees deserve better than this I was terminated at midyear because my book was losing million Thats right million Thats after Id made tens of millions for you over the past eight years You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal money now I dont quite know how to fire you Its obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at Enron have any credibility whatsoever Cutting off difficult questions on a conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees dont go along way in restoring any credibility or respect There is none left and yet you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form of compensation The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies comprehension Why exactly is Enron paying you Do you feel justified being paid by Enron Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens education funds tied up in Enron suffer more I worked at Enron from May of until this month I watched my net worth increase substantially with my hard work at Enron Now in the blink of an eye my net worth has plummeted to levels I havent experienced since long before I went to work at Enron I worked there for nearly nine years and now have nothing to show for it Well thats not entirely true I have learned a valuable lesson I will never put my faith in someone again like I did in you I now know that you couldnt care less about the wellbeing of your employees You do still however show an incredible capacity for greed You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more useful places As I said I was terminated because my book had million in losses YTD based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited In this payforperformance world where does that leave you You continue to enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day I imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost of the companys value each day the market was open I no longer work for Enron but I am left holding the bag with a ton of worthless options and shares in my k I only have a short time in which to exercise those options I dont have the luxury of waiting for enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable Im just one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives youve ruined The very people that have made you rich you have made poor And somehow you seem to smile as you keep doing it Id like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a paycheck Please write me back Sincerely Scott Hendrickson Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp

Tuesday October PM To All Enron NRON Subject Security Update Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world Some of the changes took effect immediately eg additional security personnel and some are phasing in While not all of the changes will be visible there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities In all the steps we take and recommendations we make we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security while doing our best to minimize disruption to our daytoday business Primary responsibility for Enron Corp Security resides in our business controls organization You can contact this organization through their website security by phone or by email mailto John Brindle Senior Director Business Controls leads this organization Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions or to report security threats We have two areas to update you on changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center and other facilities where practical As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center US drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identification Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card Adult visitors without a valid photo ID US drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identification will not be allowed access to the Enron Center Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor signed into a visitors log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor and escorted to their appointment At the conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor the visitor badge collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines report suspicious activity to Security phone do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open allowing tail gating by others These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment we expect the inconvenience to decrease We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes we have two important recommendations While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan Indonesia Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Georgia and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled In addition we recommend that planned travel to Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank Jordan Lebanon Saudi Arabia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered For nonUS citizens traveling in the United States corporate security recommends that you carry documentation There have been several recent reports of nonUS citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding US domestic flights As a result we suggest that all nonUS citizens who currently reside in the United States and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status carry their passport Form I and Form I at all times We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of to carry hisher registration documentation with them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident Card Form I card Employment Authorization Card Border Crossing Card or a Temporary Resident Card Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for registration documentation but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by email as appropriate

summary The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo del the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remainin g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process Ho wever since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its de termination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO This should be done by FERC quickly There should be no further delay Regardless of the model FERC should enc ourage the collaborative process She thinks that this should be done by t he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER C orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down Parties should reconvene within days after FERCs order adopting a m odel and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within days thereafter She recommends to FERC that pa rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within days however she reco mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject he r recommendations or change something I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedt ype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our sugg ested changes Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholde r participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her Wh ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly she does not ad opt any timeframes we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec Day start date for LMPfinancial rights congestion model to be implemented The attachments below are her report the Southern etal proposal and the G rid pricing congestion management operating and planning protocols with out any changes Clearly our response FERC will include our proposed cha nges to the documents Highlights from her report below She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input r egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s ponsored Model transco in RTO LMPfinancial rights congestion managemen t is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and C ommission precedent This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern et als proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model i s not Order No compliant The Southern etal model has a hybrid phy sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a nd LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsib ilities The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement the Independent Market Administrator IMA The IMA was a dded to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission ow ner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution The IMA would a dminister the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and tra nsmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function She str ongly encourages this split Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one wi th RTO oversight Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pur suant to operating procedures approved by the RTOIMA Recognizes that con solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures Protocols should be subject to further discussion RTOtransco has primary responsibility for tariff administration including rate changes and tariff filings All load under the rates terms and conditions of OATT GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders and thus retains their rights should they win on appeal transmission pricing zones initially Entergy Southern GridSouth and G ridFlorida Allows for participant funded direct assigned and merchant t ransmission Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal for existin g facilities and regional charge for new facilities other than those abo ve There will be one through and out rate plus a Grid Management Char ge for RTO operation Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT Financial RightsLMP includes real time spot market is clearly the pref erred model and represents best practices model from PJM and SPP many details need to be worked out in continued discussions Model allows parti es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges FCH Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation auction and nondiscriminatory release The Grid model includes a balancing resource requirement that we will provide comments against Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported control area operators required to provide before such market establishment RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC RTOtransco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functio ns all of our comments from last weeks response are included Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners Many a re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis an d had concerns over the costs She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of s cale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions concerned about cost shiftin g mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo wed Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a ssets concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re tail open access concerns with Cal Judge encourages the Commission to u tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump sta rt it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions Furthermore the in itial results after days show the majority of participants favoring a b est practices PJMSPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b oard structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this

Students You successfully completed Trimester I and were headed into Trimester II As Im sure youve already noticed the material is getting more and more challenging You should also be aware that I will be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses The Unit Test is a good example of the thinking skills that Id like to see The multiple choice questions were quite challenging and required that you apply what wed learned Although the class average was on this test and many of you scored lower than you normally do I think that we have to give ourselves credit for passing such a challenging test The best news is that your portfolio grades will more than make up for a lower test score One might say that I even planned it that way Now we have to get ready for the next test It will be a similar test in style and difficulty and we wont be doing a portfolio So you should take the Unit Test and study the type of questions that you missed Dont worryI know you can handle this By the end of the year you will be a superb test taker and algebraist PS Dont forget to discuss your Unit Test score with your parents They had to take challenging tests in their day and they can help you prepare for the types of questions even if theyve forgotten some of the math Mrs Ward

Kean Steven J Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Lindberg Susan Robertson Linda Fulton Donna Alvarez Ray Connor Joe Staines Dan Stroup Kerry Migden Janine Walton Steve Comnes Alan Mara Susan Maurer Luiz Philipp Meredith Cc Allegretti Daniel Hoatson Tom Fromer Howard Subject Northeast RTO Mediation Report Yesterday afternoon September the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the day mediation session Although not unexpected but still disappointing the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs This market design proposal encompasses a long drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like minimum months before work begins to develop the new RTO The target implementation date of the ISOs is November but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is subject to extension if new design requirements are introduced We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures A copy of the Judges report and the Business Plan are attached One good aspect of the Judges report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance We too believe this is necessary It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities or the New England ISO on market design or governance We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system with enhancements where possible Others relying on the ambiguity in FERCs orders argued that FERC really intended to create a new system using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs regardless of time or complication of creating this new market We need FERC direction on this and the Judge makes this clear Background The Judges primary goal of this day mediation process was simply to establish a business plan which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created Enron along with many other participants opposed this approach arguing that we are wasting the days given to us by the Commission The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly Although the majority of the Judges report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan he does discuss two substantive issues market design and governance Market Design At the beginning of the mediation PJM NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO This proposal envisions a timeintensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders with an implementation date in years Option Mof the Business Plan This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs PJM has its own approach see below The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in years Option M of the Business Plan PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single dayahead and realtime energy market by November Option M of the Business Plan We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December but no later than May Although we Enron believe PJMs November time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable As noted above the Judge endorses Option M in part because it has a builtin a process for determining Best Practices Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices The Judge acknowledges that support for Option M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance interim governance final governance board makeup and stakeholder process The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs from PJM from New York and from New England The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board One proposal would have board members from each ISO with a nonvoting CEO The other proposal would have board members from each ISO with additional board members to be elected by stakeholders We support the PJM board makeup proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a wellreasoned even conservative approach to reaching that goal Therefore even though the Judge sided with New York we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report Sarah Dan Howard and Tom

Education Dear Steven Kean I am contacting you directly because you are the leader of Enrons educational initiatives I am hoping you will take a few minutes to allow me to introduce myself and my company I am sure you do not appreciate unsolicited mail therefore I apologize for this intrusion but I believe I you will be interested in what I have to say I am a founder in a fairly new company that is focused on a new technology for education We are building oneonone relationships between major companies and universities We are not a distance learning company We do not provide content We simply provide a unique platform for people to communicate with each other over great distances as though everyone involved were sitting in the same room My goal today is to provide you with information that could allow Enron to have direct links into university classrooms The possibilities include having Enron executives and managers attend a Stanford MBA program without having to travel to Palo Alto or attend a Harvard executive program without having to leave the workplace Our plan is simple Enron picks the school of its choice we install digital classrooms at the school and at Enron Through the use of digital technology these classrooms now become one Enron employees now attend the same class in real time that is being taught at a school or university The additional benefits to Enron are many less time lost all travel expenses saved employee moral and retention to name a few This also allows key executives to upgrade their skills that would normally not want to be away from their job and family My company Telanetix is building a network of virtual or digital classrooms around the country to link major universities with major corporations Our digital classrooms are unlike anything you have seen They appear as well appointed lecture rooms but the front and back walls are high resolution video screens There are no visible cameras or microphones Everyone in each room sees everyone else people are lifesized there is no latency sound is directional no panning or zooming is used etc The technology is transparent to the participants and this allows them to concentrate on each other The impression of the participants is that they are all in one large room No training is required to use the roomall that is required is for the participants to enter the room and start talking The digital classrooms are so real in its effect that this technology is being readily accepted among elite school as a means for distant education All classes or programs are exactly the same as being taught on campus today Prospective students still apply to the college of choice and are admitted through the same process as students who plan to attend class on campus All programs will have the full acceptance and accreditation of the school where the classes originate When it is all said and done Telanetix becomes invisible We simply link the likes of Stanford Harvard and MIT directly into corporate training centers Enron employees would interact directly with the University and pay their tuition to the University Telanetix collects its fees from the University and not the students This technology is up and operating Our partner TeleSuite Dayton Ohio has established about conference rooms around the country with companies such as IBM COM CIGNA Price Waterhouse Coopers and AOLTime Warner The University of Arizona and Duke University also have rooms The University of Arizona is using a prototype of a teaching room to conduct two Executive MBA programs in the Silicon Valley COM from their Tucson campus Duke uses the technology to communicate on administrative issues with their campus in Frankfurt Germany Telanetix anticipates installing classrooms at Stanford University and the University of Maryland in the near future Additionally we are linking overseas sites to this network in England and Australia This technology is new and cuttingedge I hope Enron will consider joining the small but growing list of companies that are bringing tier one education directly into the workplace In addition to using the digital classroom for higher education all our business customers are using them for virtual conference rooms usually between executives in different locations IBM for example has five of these rooms and is ordering five more because they have proven to be very cost effective as a means to reduce travel Why Because the conferencing is so profoundly real in its effect that the users feel as if they are all present in the same room This is not videoconferencing This is way beyond that As executive vice president and chief of staff for Enron I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to read this I believe that we have a value proposition for Enron to consider I would very much like to demo our digital classroom to you and discuss the benefits and possibilities it might bring Below I have attached a few pictures of the digital classroom For more information please visit our web site at wwwtelanetixcom I look forward to your response Sincerely Steve Bryan Executive Vice President Business Development

Obligation Section g of Senate Bill provides that for any REP serving an agg regate load in excess of MW of the load must consist of residential customers A REP can fulfil this requirement by Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to o f its total load That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf or It pays dollar per MWH of required load into the System Benefit Fun d EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power to serve residential load on its behalf or can pay the per MWH penalty There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate compliance if it has an agreement with New Power EES Contract For price to beat customers the utilities have by Commission rule the obl igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the year period conmmencing The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab use this provision by gaming the system The Enron contracts as currently w ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission Until the utilit ies move to amend the relevant rules the Commission can only exercise its displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond uct amounts to abuse and gaming I think it will ultimately be a question o f degree and pattern of switching The onus will be on the affiliated REPs to prove abuse and gaming Fundamentally it is in the best interest of the market to allow customers to come and go Customer mobility is the best cu stomer protection in a competitive market Besides a restraint on customer mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c ustomer inertia The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action t o insure that they achieve a reasonable

Therefore I ca nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement However it i s something we definitely need to look into In addition we EPMIEWS ar e getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they see the pilot and the market structure unfolding Specifically they are n ot pleased with retail energy providers contracts that contemplate the rig ht to switch between direct access and tariff and visaversa We will mo nitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their displeasure On the residential requirement front someone needs to address this Speci fically is this true If so what rate classes are considered industrial vs commercial Is there a similar requirement for commercial load Is TI considered industrial Do we already have industrial customers in our por tfolio Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter marke ts Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspe ctive as

US Locations A few more details Again most of the EGA companies ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities Through further research we found a few more that dont totally fit that mold Elektro Electricidad e Servicos SA in Brazil of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities EPE Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris SC Ltda aka Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a direct ownership interest and one Board vote Energia Ltd another Brazil operation is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of Feb Again this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject RE Non US Locations Steve As stated earlier many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership We can assure you that for the most part you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ie Corp ENA EES etc There are a few however that may be incorrectly categorized as follows EA ECT Non US Payroll Company there is no such entity but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA Enron Capital Trade Resources in London UK may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited EBS Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd actually comes up to Corp through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance EEOS Enron Engineering Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe EES Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities ServicesLimbach companies EGA Heres where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with complicated multilayers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp ownership As you know all of the old subsets ie APACHI CALME etc have gone away and everything international is now EGA To the best of our knowledge all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed Following are the exceptions andor unusual organizational structure that should be noted Electricidad Enron de Guatemala SA actually reports up through ENA San Juan Gas Company Inc in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp owned Enron American del Sur SA is an Enron CorpEnron Transportation Services entity No entity called Enron Singapore more than likely Enron Capital Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company EIM No Stadacona Paper Company but it is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp as the general partner and a list of Limited Partners including ENA Enron Corp and a nonEnron entity Salomon Brothers Holding Company Inc ENW Enron Net Works LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp company EWC The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp which is owned by Smith Street Land Co an Enron Corp company but many of the names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas SA no Enron Wind UK no Enron Wind India but regardless they are all part of the EWCEREC family GLOBAL These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration Production Inc which is owned by Enron Corp but one has indirect outside ownership EP Enron Oil Gas India Ltd for instance is owned by Enron Asst Holdings which is owned by Enron Finance Partners which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one nonEnron entity Zephyrus Investments LLC with a small interest Again I hope this information is helpful For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track Let my group know if we can be

totally fit that mold Elektro Electricidad e Servicos SA in Brazil of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities EPE Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris SC Ltda aka Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a direct ownership interest and one Board vote Energia Ltd another Brazil operation is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of Feb Again this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject RE Non US Locations Steve As stated earlier many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership We can assure you that for the most part you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ie Corp ENA EES etc There are a few however that may be incorrectly categorized as follows EA ECT Non US Payroll Company there is no such entity but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA Enron Capital Trade Resources in London UK may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited EBS Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd actually comes up to Corp through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance EEOS Enron Engineering Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe EES Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities ServicesLimbach companies EGA Heres where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with complicated multilayers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp ownership As you know all of the old subsets ie APACHI CALME etc have gone away and everything international is now EGA To the best of our knowledge all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed Following are the exceptions andor unusual organizational structure that should be noted Electricidad Enron de Guatemala SA actually reports up through ENA San Juan Gas Company Inc in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp owned Enron American del Sur SA is an Enron CorpEnron Transportation Services entity No entity called Enron Singapore more than likely Enron Capital Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company EIM No Stadacona Paper Company but it is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp as the general partner and a list of Limited Partners including ENA Enron Corp and a nonEnron entity Salomon Brothers Holding Company Inc ENW Enron Net Works LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp company EWC The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp which is owned by Smith Street Land Co an Enron Corp company but many of the names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas SA no Enron Wind UK no Enron Wind India but regardless they are all part of the EWCEREC family GLOBAL These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration Production Inc which is owned by Enron Corp but one has indirect outside ownership EP Enron Oil Gas India Ltd for instance is owned by Enron Asst Holdings which is owned by Enron Finance Partners which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one nonEnron entity Zephyrus Investments LLC with a small interest Again I hope this information is helpful For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track Let my group know if we can be

Obligation Section g of Senate Bill provides that for any REP serving an agg regate load in excess of MW of the load must consist of residential customers A REP can fulfil this requirement by Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to o f its total load That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf or It pays dollar per MWH of required load into the

reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate compliance if it has an agreement with New Power EES Contract For price to beat customers the utilities have by Commission rule the obl igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the year period conmmencing The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab use this provision by gaming the system The Enron contracts as currently w ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission Until the utilit ies move to amend the relevant rules the Commission can only exercise its displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond uct amounts to abuse and gaming I think it will ultimately be a question o f degree and pattern of switching The onus will be on the affiliated REPs to prove abuse and gaming Fundamentally it is in the best interest of the market to allow customers to come and go Customer mobility is the best cu stomer protection in a competitive market Besides a restraint on customer mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c ustomer inertia The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action t o insure that they achieve a reasonable

Therefore I ca nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement However it i s something we definitely need to look into In addition we EPMIEWS ar e getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they see the pilot and the market structure unfolding Specifically they are n ot pleased with retail energy providers contracts that contemplate the rig ht to switch between direct access and tariff and visaversa We will mo nitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their displeasure On the residential requirement front someone needs to address this Speci fically is this true If so what rate classes are considered industrial vs commercial Is there a similar requirement for commercial load Is TI considered industrial Do we already have industrial customers in our por tfolio Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter marke ts Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspe ctive as
