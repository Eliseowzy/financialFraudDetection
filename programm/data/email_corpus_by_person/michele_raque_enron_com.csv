Technologies Inc or For Immediate Release WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS SMALL ENERGY PRODUCERS NEW METERING OPTION Valley Forge PA September PJM Interconnection LLC administrator of the worlds largest competitive wholesale energy market and operator of the electric grid for the midAtlantic region and Comverge Technologies a global data communications company today announced a program that provides small energy producers a lowcost secure wireless connection to PJMs information systems PJM and Comverge Technologies have formed a partnership to create systems to allow direct communication of metered information from small energy producers KW to MW using wireless cellular technology These energy producers which include renewable sources such as windmill solar and small hydro facilities may not have been able to fully participate in PJMs markets because of the capital equipment costs and investment in communications infrastructure In addition to the lower costs small energy producers will benefit from the instanton capabilities of the wireless communications network that allows for rapid deployment of new customer connections PJMs partnership with Comverge Technologies supports our goal to continually strengthen our technological capabilities so we can offer more choices to our market participants said Phillip G Harris PJM President and Chief Executive Officer This program will allow for greater participation in the midAtlantic regions energy market PJMs commitment to increasing reliability and advancing technical solutions such as the Comverge Distributed Connection for distributed generation monitoring and dispatch is critical to advancing in the changing energy marketplace said Frank Magnotti Comverge President The technology consists of interfacing the customers revenue meter at the customers site with the Comverge Distributed Communications device communicating over a cellular network then securely through the Internet into the master supervisory control and data acquisition system at PJM Some of the benefits for the user include nonproprietary hardwaresoftware interfaces industry standard protocols economic equipment and communications costs multiple suppliers for customer equipment rapid deployment and modular approach The technology allows PJM to communicate with a broad range of external customers and combine the acquisition of real time and revenue information into one system In short the program simplifies the complex task of interfacing to external customer equipment PJM the countrys only fully functioning regional

higher while sales in the industrial sector were percent lower than amounts reported a year ago Utility Fuel Receipts Costs and QualityMarch Coal Receipts of coal at electric utilities totaled million short tons down million short tons from the level reported in March The decrease from the prior year level is due partly to the sale and reclassification of utility plants as nonutility plants Plants recently reclassified as nonutility and no longer required to report fuel receipts on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Form include those operated by Atlantic City Electric Company Baltimore Gas Electric Company Cajun Electric Power Cooperative Central Hudson Gas Electric Company Duquesne Light Company PECO Energy Pennsylvania Power Light Company Potomac Edison Company Potomac Electric Power Company and Public Service Electric Gas Company of New Jersey In addition data for the Tennessee Valley Authority was not available at the time of publication and is not included in this report Petroleum Receipts of petroleum totaled million barrels up nearly million barrels from the level reported in March While the sale and reclassification of plants has reduced fuel oil receipts over the past year this increase in petroleum receipts is due partly to utilities switching from natural gas to a less expensive fuel oil as a replacement fuel Also the increase in consumption of fuel oil during December through February required some rebuilding of stocks The average delivered cost of fuel oil was per million Btu up from per million Btu reported in March Gas Receipts of gas totaled billion cubic feet Bcf down from Bcf reported in March The average cost of gas delivered to electric utilities was per million Btu compared to per million Btu reported in March
