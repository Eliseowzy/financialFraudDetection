are you kidding ive been here months and havent done it yet so glad yall liked the market and the bite i think the seattle market is so neat some of those people travel hours every day to get to seattle to sell their fruits flowers etc alot of them are asian immigrants just trying to make it in america all the stalls where they sell fish etc are great small business success stories thats why i like supporting it take care bonnie Original Message From mailto Sent Monday August AM To Bonnie Lathram Subject RE more seattle advice Sorry it took me so long to respond Its been really busy here lately Youre going to be so disappointed in us but we never ended up kayaking Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks It was so fun getting to talk to yall and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside The Market was fantastic We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic We also hit the Bite which was really neat Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time youre in Houston It be great to

From Bonnie Lathram MNArchitectscomENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESBonnieLathramCblathramLMNArchitects EcomE NRONcom Sent Tuesday July AM To Scott Susan M Subject more seattle advice hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayakingetc when i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have info on that sort of thing in seattle if you have a sec you may want to try seattleinsidercom i think they are supposed to be pretty good and helpful i havent talked to luke yet so i dont exactly know my plans for the weekend unfortunately i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday night or head out and have drinks or both or whatever yall want to do the weather is supposed to be great this weekend but with seattle you never know my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for sure or a pullover or something it gets so darn cold at night believe me you will be glad plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside ive already given you my cell phone number i think definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime on it if i dont answer i check it frequently and you can leave a message and ill call you back very exciting to have visitors from texas see you friday hopefully oh where are you staying bonnie Original Message From Scott Susan M mailtoSusanM NRONcom Sent Monday July AM To Bonnie Lathram Subject Tour Guide Hi Bonnie How are you doing Lisa said youd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutcheswhich Im guessing is no fun when youre riding public transportation Anyway I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle One of my coworkers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers I hope youre still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago It looks like you may have changed jobs already which I trust is a good thing for you Im very anxious to see the city and all it has to offerthere is a part of me that has always thought Id like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants bars outdoor activities etc that would be great and maybe if youre in town we could get together for a meal or a drink Thanks a bunch Susan
