Potentially Settled in a Companys Own Stock Abstract EITF ABSTRACTS Issue No Title Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in a Companys Own Stock Dates Discussed November January March May July September January July September November January References FASB Statement No Accounting for Futures Contracts FASB Statement No Accounting for StockBased Compensation FASB Statement No Earnings per Share FASB Discussion Memorandum Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments November APB Opinion No Reporting the Results of Operations APB Opinion No Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants APB Opinion No Earnings per Share APB Opinion No Interest on Receivables and Payables SEC Accounting Series Release No Presentation in Financial Statements of Redeemable Preferred Stocks ISSUE For a number of business reasons a company may enter into contracts that are indexed to and sometimes settled in its own stock Examples of these contracts include written put options written call options and warrants purchased put options purchased call options forward sale contracts and forward purchase contracts These contracts may be settled using a variety of settlement methods or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods The settlement methods are Physical settlement the party designated in the contract as the buyer delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller and the seller delivers the full stated number of shares to the buyer Net share settlement the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain Net cash settlement the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain a cash payment equal to the gain and no shares are exchanged The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in another financial instrument A freestanding contract is entered into separate and apart from any of the companys other financial instruments or equity transactions or it is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments for example forward contracts options and warrants This Issue does not apply to security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to or otherwise based on the price of the issuers stock that are issued in connection with a purchase business combination Note See STATUS section nor does it address the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the financial instrument This Issue does not address the accounting for contracts that are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from nonemployees The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock should be classified and measured EITF DISCUSSION A Framework for Accounting The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock and reached several consensuses as described below The consensuses in this Issue are to be applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock however nonpublic companies may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No Put Warrants to the instruments covered by that Issue Hereinafter the framework for accounting that is established in this Issue is referred to as the Model Initial balance sheet classification The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and contracts that require settlement in shares are equity instruments If the contract provides the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares the Model assumes settlement in shares if the contract provides the counterparty with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares the Model assumes net cash settlement However this Model is not applicable when settlement alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one of the settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors In those situations the accounting for the instrument or combination of instruments should be based on the economic substance of the transaction For example if a freestanding contract issued together with another instrument requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or guaranteed return such that the instruments are insubstance debt the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities regardless of the settlement terms of the freestanding contract Accordingly unless the economic substance indicates otherwise contracts would be initially classified as equity or as assets or liabilities in the following situations Equity instruments Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in its own shares physical settlement or net share settlement Assets or liabilities Contracts that require net cash settlement Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares physical settlement or net share settlement Initial measurement and subsequent balance sheet classification and measurement The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the assumed or required settlement method in above Contracts that are initially classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity If physical settlement was assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of the physical settlement then public companies should refer to ASR which provides guidance by analogy for those transactions and account for the transactions as provided below under Equity instruments temporary equity For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company deliver cash net share settlement should be assumed For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company deliver cash physical settlement should be assumed For example if the company sells put options indexed to its own stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike price Equity instruments permanent equity Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized Contracts that give the company a choice of a net cash settlement or settlement in shares including net share settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver shares or b either net share settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized If such contracts are ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver cash the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction of or an addition to contributed capital Equity instruments temporary equity Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required for public companies ASR provides guidance by analogy for transactions classified as temporary equity Contracts that a require that the company deliver cash as part of a physical settlement b give the company a choice of either net cash settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash or c give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity and an amount equal to the cash redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to temporary equity Assets or liabilities Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should be measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings and disclosed in the financial statements If contracts initially classified as assets or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares any gains or losses on those contracts should continue to be included in earnings B Hedging The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the contracts within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all the criteria of Statement The SEC staff also believes that hedge accounting for transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph of Opinion Because of the SEC staffs position the Task Force decided to end its discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge accounting C Application of the Model to Specific Instruments The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the application of the Model described in Section A of this Issue to certain freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock Written put options and forward purchase contracts Includes shareholder rights SHARP rights issued by the company to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number of common shares to the company for cash Description The company the buyer agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified price at some future date The contract may be settled by physical settlement net share settlement or net cash settlement or the issuing company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed in C Consensus The Model would be applied as follows One Settlement Method Physical a Net Share Net Cash Initial Classification Equity x x Asset Liability x Initial Measurement Subsequent

call options or warrants and purchased put options Description The issuing company the seller agrees to sell shares of its stock to the buyer of the contract at a specified price at some future date The contract may be settled by physical settlement net share settlement or net cash settlement or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods Consensus The Model would be applied as follows One Settlement Method Physical a Net Share Net Cash Initial Classification Equity x x AssetLiability x Initial Measurement Subsequent Classification and Measurement Fair value

contracts are ultimately settled in shares any gains or losses on those contracts should continue to be included in earnings Purchased call options Description The company the buyer purchases call options that provide it with the right but not the obligation to buy from the seller shares of the companys stock at a specified price If the options are exercised the contract may be settled by physical settlement net share settlement or net cash settlement or the issuing company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods Consensus The company should follow the table included in above in accounting for the call options Detachable stock purchase warrants Description An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that gives the holder both the right to purchase shares of the enterprises stock for per share and the right that is a put to require that the enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least per share at a date several months after the maturity of the notes in about years Consensus The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion The warrants should be considered in substance debt and accounted for as a liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the share settlement alternative on the issuance date Put warrants Description Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put options The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise a the warrant feature to acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price b the put option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment or in some cases c both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment Put warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the issuer are detachable from the debt and may be exercisable only under specified conditions The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying circumstances for example with the passage of time or if the issuer has a public stock offering Under Opinion a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants Consensus Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or settlement in shares public companies should report the proceeds from the issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings Nonpublic companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance with the consensus in Issue D Earnings per Share The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options affect the earningspershare calculation If the written put options are in the money during the period being reported on the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be computed using the reverse treasury stock method Under that method the incremental number of shares is computed as a the number of shares that would need to be issued for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put obligation less b the number of shares received from satisfying the puts The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues relating to earnings per share in this Issue The Task Force agreed that the FASB should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its project on earnings per share Note See STATUS section STATUS In February the FASB issued Statement which supersedes Opinion Statement is effective for financial statements for both interim and annual periods ending after December and earlier application is not permitted Statement affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written put options affect the earnings per share calculation That is in computing diluted EPS Statement requires use of the reverse treasury stock method to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar contracts that are in the money during the reporting period Statement states that purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would be antidilutive At the July and November meetings an FASB staff representative made an announcement Topic No D Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation of Diluted Earnings per Share that for those contracts that provide the company with a choice of settlement methods the company shall assume that the contract will be settled in shares That presumption may be overcome if past experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash For contracts in which the counterparty controls the means of settlement past experience or a stated policy is not determinative Accordingly in those situations the more dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used At the July meeting the Task Force addressed the accounting for contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in Issue No Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase Business Combination The Task force observed that Issue should be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in Issue for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase business combination A related issue has been discussed in Issue No The Application of Issue No to Forward Equity Sales Transactions That Issue deals with the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a freestanding derivative instrument a forward contract that is indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock is issued concurrent with the issuance of shares of the companys stock This Issue is limited to situations in which the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the forward contract Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No Accounting for Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary That Issue deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible into the stock of a consolidated subsidiary As part of the discussion of Issue Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the consolidated entity are considered a companys own stock A related issue was discussed at the May meeting in Issue No Application of Issue No to Derivative Instruments with Multiple Settlement Alternatives That Issue deals with how certain derivative contracts indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock that contain multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No Accounting for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program That Issue addressed the accounting for and poolingofinterests implications of purchasing treasury stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the companys own shares At the March meeting the Task Force discussed a related issue in Issue No Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments entered into by a parent company that are indexed to and potentially settled in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the consolidated financial statements Another related issue was discussed at the March meeting in Issue No Application of Issue No to Equity Derivative Instruments That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events outside the Control of the Issuer Occur That Issue deals with how certain derivative contracts indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for No further EITF discussion is planned

Action on Derivatives on a Companys Own Shares EITF Action on Derivatives on a Companys Own Shares July At its July meeting the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF tentatively resolved how certain settlement features affect accounting for equity derivative contracts entered into by a company on its own stock Specifically the EITF sketched out a model governing how such features affect whether the contract should be treated as a an equity instrument a nd reported in stockholders equity or b an asset or liability at fair va lue with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings EITF Issue No Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer for Purposes of Applying Issue No was taken up to address implementation of the EITFs March consensus on EITF Issue No Application of EITF Issue No to Equity Derivative Transactions That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Cash Settlement If Certain Events Occur The final consensus in Issue generally stated that equity derivative contracts that contained provisions that implicitly or explicitly required net cash settlement outside of the control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities and carrie d at fair value rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and reported as part of permanent equity as provided for in EITF Issue No Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentiall y Settled in a Companys Own Stock The Task Force also tentatively provided an extended transition period for existing contracts and contracts entered into before a final consensus is reached The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September EITF meeting The Model The models governing concept is that for a contract to be accounted as permanent equity the contracts provisions should put the companys counterparty in no better position than the companys common shareholder s Specifically the EITF tentatively concluded that contracts in a company s own stock such as written puts or forward purchase contracts that come under the scope of Issue and have net share settlement provisions tha t keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th e following characteristics otherwise the contract must be treated as an asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares at its option in either registered or unregistered shares It was determined that the ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan y The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be delivered in a net share settlement This cap must exist even if the contra ct terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger The need f or a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract At contract inception and on an ongoing basis the company must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options convertibles and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid e of the control of the company In this context the company is defined as the companys management rather than its management and shareholders There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in the contract or for any reason There are no required cash payments to the counterparty trueups if the n et shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit h full satisfaction of the amount due However trueups may be included in t he contract if the company only not the counterparty can choose whether to satisfy the trueup in shares or cash and the trueup is subject to the explicit cap discussed in item There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that would economically compel the company to settle in net cash The right to increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia l between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a penalty There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart y had creditor rights or would otherwise contravene the objective of this model that the counterpartys rights would rank no higher than those of a common shareholder Subject to future EITF discussions it may be possible to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a specific statement of this concept in the contract Related Issues There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and settlement in the event of a merger or change in control There was general support for a position that as long as the counterparty received the same choice of compensation as other shareholders for example stock for stock stock and cash for stock cash for stock the fact that the counterparty might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen t for the contract Similarly in the event of nationalization or liquidation a net cash settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud e equity treatment for the contract In addition counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common shareholders should be acceptable for example rights to sue for damages i n the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company simply refused to perform under the contract as long as a common sharehold er would also have those rights With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with the model at inception to later become noncompliant for example because a n acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to satisfy the contract the EITF concluded that at the time the contract is no longer compliant the fair value of the contract should be transferred from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes in fair value reported currently in earnings There would be no immediate earnings effect at the time of this transfer Further if at a later date sufficient shares were authorized to again satisfy the contract the carrying amount of the contract that is its fai r value would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi ty prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as an asset or liability Transition The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da te of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti on to achieve equity treatment The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September EITF meeting For contracts entered into before the date of a final consensus a company will have until June to modify the contract to comply with the final consensus For example if a company entered into a contract before the date of the final consensus the company will have until June to obtain any shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the tentative model Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force EITF meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB

company s own stock such as written puts or forward purchase contracts that come under the scope of Issue and have net share settlement provisions tha t keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th e following characteristics otherwise the contract must be treated as an asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares at its option in either registered or unregistered shares It was determined that the ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan y The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be delivered in a net share settlement This cap must exist even if the contra ct terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger The need f or a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract At contract inception and on an ongoing basis the company must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options convertibles and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid e of the control of the company In this context the company is defined as the companys management rather than its management and shareholders There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in the contract or for any reason There are no required cash payments to the counterparty trueups if the n et shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit h full satisfaction of the amount due However trueups may be included in t he contract if the company only not the counterparty can choose whether to satisfy the trueup in shares or cash and the trueup is subject to the explicit cap discussed in item There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that would economically compel the company to settle in net cash The right to increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia l between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a penalty There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart y had creditor rights or would otherwise contravene the objective of this model that the counterpartys rights would rank no higher than those of a common shareholder Subject to future EITF discussions it may be possible to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a specific statement of this concept in the contract Related Issues There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and settlement in the event of a merger or change in control There was general support for a position that as long as the counterparty received the same choice of compensation as other shareholders for example stock for stock stock and cash for stock cash for stock the fact that the counterparty might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen t for the contract Similarly in the event of nationalization or liquidation a net cash settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud e equity treatment for the contract In addition counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common shareholders should be acceptable for example rights to sue for damages i n the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company simply refused to perform under the contract as long as a common sharehold er would also have those rights With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with the model at inception to later become noncompliant for example because a n acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to satisfy the contract the EITF concluded that at the time the contract is no longer compliant the fair value of the contract should be transferred from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes in fair value reported currently in earnings There would be no immediate earnings effect at the time of this transfer Further if at a later date sufficient shares were authorized to again satisfy the contract the carrying amount of the contract that is its fai r value would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi ty prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as an asset or liability Transition The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da te of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti on to achieve equity treatment The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September EITF meeting For contracts entered into before the date of a final consensus a company will have until June to modify the contract to comply with the final consensus For example if a company entered into a contract before the date of the final consensus the company will have until June to obtain any shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the tentative model Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force EITF meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB

Compensation FASB Statement No Earnings per Share FASB Discussion Memorandum Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments November APB Opinion No Reporting the Results of Operations APB Opinion No Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants APB Opinion No Earnings per Share APB Opinion No Interest on Receivables and Payables SEC Accounting Series Release No Presentation in Financial Statements of Redeemable Preferred Stocks ISSUE For a number of business reasons a company may enter into contracts that are indexed to and sometimes settled in its own stock Examples of these contracts include written put options written call options and warrants purchased put options purchased call options forward sale contracts and forward purchase contracts These contracts may be settled using a variety of settlement methods or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods The settlement methods are Physical settlement the party designated in the contract as the buyer delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller and the seller delivers the full stated number of shares to the buyer Net share settlement the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain Net cash settlement the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain a cash payment equal to the gain and no shares are exchanged The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in another financial instrument A freestanding contract is entered into separate and apart from any of the companys other financial instruments or equity transactions or it is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments for example forward contracts options and warrants This Issue does not apply to security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to or otherwise based on the price of the issuers stock that are issued in connection with a purchase business combination Note See STATUS section nor does it address the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the financial instrument This Issue does not address the accounting for contracts that are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from nonemployees The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock should be classified and measured EITF DISCUSSION A Framework for Accounting The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock and reached several consensuses as described below The consensuses in this Issue are to be applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock however nonpublic companies may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No Put Warrants to the instruments covered by that Issue Hereinafter the framework for accounting that is established in this Issue is referred to as the Model Initial balance sheet classification The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and contracts that require settlement in shares are equity instruments If the contract provides the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares the Model assumes settlement in shares if the contract provides the counterparty with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares the Model assumes net cash settlement However this Model is not applicable when settlement alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one of the settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors In those situations the accounting for the instrument or combination of instruments should be based on the economic substance of the transaction For example if a freestanding contract issued together with another instrument requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or guaranteed return such that the instruments are insubstance debt the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities regardless of the settlement terms of the freestanding contract Accordingly unless the economic substance indicates otherwise contracts would be initially classified as equity or as assets or liabilities in the following situations Equity instruments Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in its own shares physical settlement or net share settlement Assets or liabilities Contracts that require net cash settlement Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares physical settlement or net share settlement Initial measurement and subsequent balance sheet classification and measurement The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the assumed or required settlement method in above Contracts that are initially classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity If physical settlement was assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of the physical settlement then public companies should refer to ASR which provides guidance by analogy for those transactions and account for the transactions as provided below under Equity instruments temporary equity For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company deliver cash net share settlement should be assumed For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company deliver cash physical settlement should be assumed For example if the company sells put options indexed to its own stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike price Equity instruments permanent equity Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized Contracts that give the company a choice of a net cash settlement or settlement in shares including net share settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver shares or b either net share settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized If such contracts are ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver cash the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction of or an addition to contributed capital Equity instruments temporary equity Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required for public companies ASR provides guidance by analogy for transactions classified as temporary equity Contracts that a require that the company deliver cash as part of a physical settlement b give the company a choice of either net cash settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash or c give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity and an amount equal to the cash redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to temporary equity Assets or liabilities Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should be measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings and disclosed in the financial statements If contracts initially classified as assets or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares any gains or losses on those contracts should continue to be included in earnings B Hedging The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the contracts within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all the criteria of Statement The SEC staff also believes that hedge accounting for transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph of Opinion Because of the SEC staffs position the Task Force decided to end its discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge accounting C Application of the Model to Specific Instruments The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the application of the Model described in Section A of this Issue to certain freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock Written put options and forward purchase contracts Includes shareholder rights SHARP rights issued by the company to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number of common shares to the company for cash Description The company the buyer agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified price at some future date The contract may be settled by physical settlement net share settlement or net cash settlement or the issuing company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods Application of the Model to purchased call options is

call options or warrants and purchased put options Description The issuing company the seller agrees to sell shares of its stock to the buyer of the contract at a specified price at some future date The contract may be settled by physical settlement net share settlement or net cash settlement or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods Consensus The Model would

contracts are ultimately settled in shares any gains or losses on those contracts should continue to be included in earnings Purchased call options Description The company the buyer purchases call options that provide it with the right but not the obligation to buy from the seller shares of the companys stock at a specified price If the options are exercised the contract may be settled by physical settlement net share settlement or net cash settlement or the issuing company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods Consensus The company should follow the table included in above in accounting for the call options Detachable stock purchase warrants Description An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that gives the holder both the right to purchase shares of the enterprises stock for per share and the right that is a put to require that the enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least per share at a date several months after the maturity of the notes in about years Consensus The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion The warrants should be considered in substance debt and accounted for as a liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the share settlement alternative on the issuance date Put warrants Description Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put options The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise a the warrant feature to acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price b the put option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment or in some cases c both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment Put warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the issuer are detachable from the debt and may be exercisable only under specified conditions The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying circumstances for example with the passage of time or if the issuer has a public stock offering Under Opinion a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants Consensus Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or settlement in shares public companies should report the proceeds from the issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings Nonpublic companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance with the consensus in Issue D Earnings per Share The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options affect the earningspershare calculation If the written put options are in the money during the period being reported on the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be computed using the reverse treasury stock method Under that method the incremental number of shares is computed as a the number of shares that would need to be issued for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put obligation less b the number of shares received from satisfying the puts The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues relating to earnings per share in this Issue The Task Force agreed that the FASB should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its project on earnings per share Note See STATUS section STATUS In February the FASB issued Statement which supersedes Opinion Statement is effective for financial statements for both interim and annual periods ending after December and earlier application is not permitted Statement affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written put options affect the earnings per share calculation That is in computing diluted EPS Statement requires use of the reverse treasury stock method to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar contracts that are in the money during the reporting period Statement states that purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would be antidilutive At the July and November meetings an FASB staff representative made an announcement Topic No D Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation of Diluted Earnings per Share that for those contracts that provide the company with a choice of settlement methods the company shall assume that the contract will be settled in shares That presumption may be overcome if past experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash For contracts in which the counterparty controls the means of settlement past experience or a stated policy is not determinative Accordingly in those situations the more dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used At the July meeting the Task Force addressed the accounting for contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in Issue No Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase Business Combination The Task force observed that Issue should be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in Issue for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase business combination A related issue has been discussed in Issue No The Application of Issue No to Forward Equity Sales Transactions That Issue deals with the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a freestanding derivative instrument a forward contract that is indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock is issued concurrent with the issuance of shares of the companys stock This Issue is limited to situations in which the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the forward contract Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No Accounting for Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary That Issue deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible into the stock of a consolidated subsidiary As part of the discussion of Issue Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the consolidated entity are considered a companys own stock A related issue was discussed at the May meeting in Issue No Application of Issue No to Derivative Instruments with Multiple Settlement Alternatives That Issue deals with how certain derivative contracts indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock that contain multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No Accounting for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program That Issue addressed the accounting for and poolingofinterests implications of purchasing treasury stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the companys own shares At the March meeting the Task Force discussed a related issue in Issue No Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments entered into by a parent company that are indexed to and potentially settled in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the consolidated financial statements Another related issue was discussed at the March meeting in Issue No Application of Issue No to Equity Derivative Instruments That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events outside the Control of the Issuer Occur That Issue deals with how certain derivative contracts indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for No further EITF discussion is planned
