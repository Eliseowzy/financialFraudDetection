with the rest of the asset base should continue to provide cost savings and build cash flow Although management has laid low over the last six months on the acquisition front we believe there are several opportunities within the sector As we have suggested before the consolidation going on within the major oil companies may fuel the consolidation within the crude oil transportation segment

Unfortunately the unit price has fallen to unattractive levels to make acquisitions If the price of the units were to improve we could see the partnership aggressively go after other acquisitions Stock Opinion We consider the Enron support of million for distribution through March as a safety net Distributable cash flow should be able to cover the common distribution We look for yield
