kindly offered that you would provide this Is this still possible We realise that you are extremely busy so Chris and Les went ahead and wrote something which is below and if you want to review change or rewritet he preface that would be very appreciated Let me know what your thoughts a re Thanks Julie were getting close Preface One of our main objectives in writing Energy Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches fo r the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss indepth the models and to show how they relate to each other In this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wid e range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which use s a consistent modelling framework We believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using adhoc and inconsiste nt models for different instruments and markets see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT MODELS However it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probab ly be clear from our discussions the models we prefer We therefore try a nd give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al l the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs In order to meet our objectives the book is divided into chapters In chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to mode l and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book In addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the BlackScholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used througho ut the book In Chapter we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices As well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices We look at the wellknow process of Geometric Brownian Motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated Chapter written by Vince Kaminski Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of Enron Corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets This chapter builds on the previous one It examines in detail the methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter Examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretativ e aspects of calculating volatility Chapter examines forward curves in the energy markets Although such curves are well understood and straightforward in the most financial markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel l defined curves In this chapter we describe forward price bounds for ener gy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments We outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach the econometric approach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti c factors Chapter presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivativ e markets and discusses their uses Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options Asian options barrier options lookba ck options and ladder options Chapter investigates single and multifactor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives Closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and European option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model Chapter shows how the prices of path dependent and American style option s can be evaluated for the models in Chapter Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard European and American style options Chapter describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve The approach results in a multifactor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves The user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form Closedform solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficie nt Monte Carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options The chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options Chapter focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models The general model presented in Chapter is ideally suited to multifactor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed Chapter examines the key risk management concept of Value at Risk VaR applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products After discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR Delta Deltagamm a historical simulation and MonteCarlo simulation applying each to the sam e portfolio of energy options In this chapter we also look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables Finally in Chapter we review modelling approaches to credit risk We look in detail at two quite different approaches CreditMetrics J P Morg an and CreditRisk Credit Suisse Financial Products for whi ch detailed information is publicly available Together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk We present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives Before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o f how both the tool and the market works The techniques we descri be are certainly not magic wands which can be waved at data and risk mana gement problems to provide instant and perfect solutions To quote from the RiskMetrics Technical Document no amount of sophisticated analyti cs will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk How ever the right tools correctly used make the job a lot easier

<5024050.1075856337759.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,julie@lacima.co.uk,2000-08-01 06:43:00,Preface for book Hope you are well We spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book and you kindly offered that you would provide this Is this still possible We realise that you are extremely busy so Chris and Les went ahead and wrote something which is below and if you want to review change or rewritet he preface that would be very appreciated Let me know what your thoughts a re Thanks Julie were getting close Preface One of our main objectives in writing Energy Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches fo r the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss indepth the models and to show how they relate to each other In this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wid e range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which use s a consistent modelling framework We believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using adhoc and inconsiste nt models for different instruments and markets see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT MODELS However it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probab ly be clear from our discussions the models we prefer We therefore try a nd give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al l the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs In order to meet our objectives the book is divided into chapters In chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to mode l and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book In addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the BlackScholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used througho ut the book In Chapter we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices As well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices We look at the wellknow process of Geometric Brownian Motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated Chapter written by Vince Kaminski Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of Enron Corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets This chapter builds on the previous one It examines in detail the methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter Examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretativ e aspects of calculating volatility Chapter examines forward curves in the energy markets Although such curves are well understood and straightforward in the most financial markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel l defined curves In this chapter we describe forward price bounds for ener gy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments We outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach the econometric approach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti c factors Chapter presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivativ e markets and discusses their uses Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options Asian options barrier options lookba ck options and ladder options Chapter investigates single and multifactor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives Closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and European option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model Chapter shows how the prices of path dependent and American style option s can be evaluated for the models in Chapter Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard European and American style options Chapter describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve The approach results in a multifactor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves The user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form Closedform solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficie nt Monte Carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options The chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options Chapter focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models The general model presented in Chapter is ideally suited to multifactor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed Chapter examines the key risk management concept of Value at Risk VaR applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products After discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR Delta Deltagamm a historical simulation and MonteCarlo simulation applying each to the sam e portfolio of energy options In this chapter we also look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables Finally in Chapter we review modelling approaches to credit risk We look in detail at two quite different approaches CreditMetrics J P Morg an and CreditRisk Credit Suisse Financial Products for whi ch detailed information is publicly available Together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk We present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives Before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o f how both the tool and the market works The techniques we descri be are certainly not magic wands which can be waved at data and risk mana gement problems to provide instant and perfect solutions To quote from the RiskMetrics Technical Document no amount of sophisticated analyti cs will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk How ever the right tools correctly used make the job a lot easier
