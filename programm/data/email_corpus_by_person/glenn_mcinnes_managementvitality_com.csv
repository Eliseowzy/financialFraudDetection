Glenn anagementVitalitycom Teamwork Newsletter NOVEMBER Trust is the fuel that moves companies forward Business is down Layoffs loom Employees are focusing on their family and many fear losing their j obs Yet you need to move your company or your department forward You nee d to move upward and onward What does it take Trust We suggest that it i s Trust that allows the balance between the opposing demands of work and qu ality of life As always moving forward requires a balance of effectiven ess vs efficiency and shortterm vs longterm goals A closely connected tenet of these four is trust and getting to trust is a process that can be worked on The ability to work towards the future as a team requires trus t because the future is pure promise and has no reality in the here and no w Without trust there can be no agreement concerning future events After all certain real clashing interests will be sacrificed in the short term for an unreal future built on promises Trust is the factor that permits common goals to benefit both parties Thus conflicts of interest are reso lved through common goals pursed in an atmosphere of mutual trust Those wh o understand capi coalesced authority power and influence know that it n aturally gives rise to conflicting interests To get things done a team mu st have common goals or interests to bind them together Mutual suspicion m ust give way to mutual trust As we well know the bearers of various impl ementation forces come into conflicts that simply do not get resolved When fundamentally different interests are at issue resolution often seems imp ossible There are no obvious or immediate winwin solutions In fact Dr Adizes makes the bold declaration that when conflict arises among people wi th different interests the shortterm outcomes can never satisfy both part ies In the short term conflicting interests can only be addressed by a co mpromise where both parties interests suffer or by a winlose scenario t hat leaves one party seriously disgruntled Destructive conflict over diff erent interests manifests itself as long drawn out tensions between the di fferent players The conflict will not go away The trick is to harness tha t conflict to achieve something rather than trying to pretend that it does not exist Avoiding conflict is not the secret Encouraging constructive c onflict is the way to move forward Trust is the only path to constructive conflict in a situation of different interests However trust can only be earned over time To establish trust one must establish a history of livi ng up to promises Since trust can be eroded in a split second making the pursuit of common goals increasingly difficult one must move slowly and ca refully and in a nonthreatening manner as one builds that history of trust To learn
