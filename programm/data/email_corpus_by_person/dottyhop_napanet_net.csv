<25751739.1075852558169.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dottyhop@napanet.net,2001-10-25 20:36:10,Fw from Fumiko Docker A Must Read Cc Original Message From Fumiko Docker To Cc Sent Thursday October PM Subject Fwd Read this if you get a chance Another perspective Brutality smeared in peanut butter Why America must stop the war now By Arundhati Roy Tuesday October As darkness deepened over Afghanistan on Sunday October the US government backed by the International Coalition Against Terror the new amenable surrogate for the United Nations launched air strikes against Afghanistan TV channels lingered on computeranimated images of cruise missiles stealth bombers tomahawks bunkerbusting missiles and Mark high drag bombs All over the world little boys watched goggleeyed and stopped clamouring for new video games The UN reduced now to an ineffective acronym wasnt even asked to mandate the air strikes As Madeleine Albright once said We will behave multilaterally when we can and unilaterally when we must The evidence against the terrorists was shared amongst friends in the coalition After conferring they announced that it didnt matter whether or not the evidence would stand up in a court of law Thus in an instant were centuries of jurisprudence carelessly trashed Nothing can excuse or justify an act of terrorism whether it is committed by religious fundamentalists private militia peoples resistance movements or whether its dressed up as a war of retribution by a recognised government The bombing of Afghanistan is not revenge for New York and Washington It is yet another act of terror against the people of the world Each innocent person that is killed must be added to not set off against the grisly toll of civilians who died in New York and Washington People rarely win wars governments rarely lose them People get killed Governments moult and regroup hydraheaded They use flags first to shrinkwrap peoples minds and smother thought and then as ceremonial shrouds to bury their willing dead On both sides in Afghanistan as well as America civilians are now hostage to the actions of their own governments Unknowingly ordinary people in both countries share a common bond they have to live with the phenomenon of blind unpredictable terror Each batch of bombs that is dropped on Afghanistan is matched by a corresponding escalation of mass hysteria in America about anthrax more hijackings and other terrorist acts There is no easy way out of the spiralling morass of terror and brutality that confronts the world today It is time now for the human race to hold still to delve into its wells of collective wisdom both ancient and modern What happened on September changed the world forever Freedom progress wealth technology war these words have taken on new meaning Governments have to acknowledge this transformation and approach their new tasks with a modicum of honesty and humility Unfortunately up to now there has been no sign of any introspection from the leaders of the International Coalition Or the Taliban When he announced the air strikes President George Bush said Were a peaceful nation Americas favourite ambassador Tony Blair who also holds the portfolio of prime minister of the UK echoed him Were a peaceful people So now we know Pigs are horses Girls are boys War is peace Speaking at the FBI headquarters a few days later President Bush said This is our calling This is the calling of the United States of America The most free nation in the world A nation built on fundamental values that reject hate reject violence rejects murderers and rejects evil We will not tire Here is a list of the countries that America has been at war with and bombed since the second world war China Korea Guatemala Indonesia Cuba the Belgian Congo Peru Laos Vietnam Cambodia Grenada Libya El Salvador s Nicaragua s Panama Iraq Bosnia Sudan Yugoslavia And now Afghanistan Certainly it does not tire this the most free nation in the world What freedoms does it uphold Within its borders the freedoms of speech religion thought of artistic expression food habits sexual preferences well to some extent and many other exemplary wonderful things Outside its borders the freedom to dominate humiliate and subjugate shy usually in the service of Americas real religion the free market So when the US government christens a war Operation Infinite Justice or Operation Enduring Freedom we in the third world feel more than a tremor of fear Because we know that Infinite Justice for some means Infinite Injustice for others And Enduring Freedom for some means Enduring Subjugation for others The International Coalition Against Terror is a largely cabal of the richest countries in the world Between them they manufacture and sell almost all of the worlds weapons they possess the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction chemical biological and nuclear They have fought the most wars account for most of the genocide subjection ethnic cleansing and human rights violations in modern history and have sponsored armed and financed untold numbers of dictators and despots Between them they have worshipped almost deified the cult of violence and war For all its appalling sins the Taliban just isnt in the same league The Taliban was compounded in the crumbling crucible of rubble heroin and landmines in the backwash of the cold war Its oldest leaders are in their early s Many of them are disfigured and handicapped missing an eye an arm or a leg They grew up in a society scarred and devastated by war Between the Soviet Union and America over years about bn bn worth of arms and ammunition was poured into Afghanistan The latest weaponry was the only shard of modernity to intrude upon a thoroughly medieval society Young boys shy many of them orphans who grew up in those times had guns for toys never knew the security and comfort of family life never experienced the company of women Now as adults and rulers the Taliban beat stone rape and brutalise women they dont seem to know what else to do with them Years of war has stripped them of gentleness inured them to kindness and human compassion Now theyve turned their monstrosity on their own people They dance to the percussive rhythms of bombs raining down around them With all due respect to President Bush the people of the world do not have to choose between the Taliban and the US government All the beauty of human civilisation our art our music our literature lies beyond these two fundamentalist ideological poles There is as little chance that the people of the world can all become middleclass consumers as there is that they will all embrace any one particular religion The issue is not about good v evil or Islam v Christianity as much as it is about space About how to accommodate diversity how to contain the impulse towards hegemony shy every kind of hegemony economic military linguistic religious and cultural Any ecologist will tell you how dangerous and fragile a monoculture is A hegemonic world is like having a government without a healthy opposition It becomes a kind of dictatorship Its like putting a plastic bag over the world and preventing it from breathing Eventually it will be torn open One and a half million Afghan people lost their lives in the years of conflict that preceded this new war Afghanistan was reduced to rubble and now the rubble is being pounded into finer dust By the second day of the air strikes US pilots were returning to their bases without dropping their assigned payload of bombs As one pilot put it Afghanistan is not a targetrich environment At a press briefing at the Pentagon Donald Rumsfeld the US defence secretary was asked if America had run out of targets First were going to rehit targets he said and second were not running out of targets Afghanistan is This was greeted with gales of laughter in the briefing room By the third day of the strikes the US defence department boasted that it had achieved air supremacy over Afghanistan Did they mean that they had destroyed both or maybe all of Afghanistans planes On the ground in Afghanistan the Northern Alliance the Talibans old enemy and therefore the international coalitions newest friend is making headway in its push to capture Kabul For the archives let it be said that the Northern Alliances track record is not very different from the Talibans But for now because its inconvenient that little detail is being glossed over The visible moderate acceptable leader of the alliance Ahmed Shah Masud was killed in a suicidebomb attack early in September The rest of the Northern Alliance is a brittle confederation of brutal warlords excommunists and unbending clerics It is a disparate group divided along ethnic lines some of whom have tasted power in Afghanistan in the past Until the US air strikes the Northern Alliance controlled about of the geographical area of Afghanistan Now with the coalitions help and air cover it is poised to topple the Taliban Meanwhile Taliban soldiers sensing imminent defeat have begun to defect to the alliance So the fighting forces are busy switching sides and changing uniforms But in an enterprise as cynical as this one it seems to matter hardly at all Love is hate north is south peace is war Among the global powers there is talk of putting in a representative government Or on the other hand of restoring the kingdom to Afghanistans year old former king Zahir Shah who has lived in exile in Rome since Thats the way the game goes support Saddam Hussein then take him out finance the mojahedin then bomb them to smithereens put in Zahir Shah and see if hes going to be a good boy Is it possible to put in a representative government Can you place an order for democracy with extra cheese and jalapeno peppers Reports have begun to trickle in about civilian casualties about cities emptying out as Afghan civilians flock to the borders which have been closed Main arterial roads have been blown up or sealed off Those who have experience of working in Afghanistan say that by early November food convoys will not be able to reach the millions of Afghans m according to the UN who run the very real risk of starving to death during the course of this winter They say that in the days that are left before winter sets in there can either be a war or an attempt to reach food to the hungry Not both As a gesture of humanitarian support the US government airdropped packets of emergency rations into Afghanistan It says it plans to drop a total of packets That will still only add up to a single meal for half a million people out of the several million in dire need of food Aid workers have condemned it as a cynical dangerous publicrelations exercise They say that airdropping food packets is worse than futile First because the food will never get to those who really need it More dangerously those who run out to retrieve the packets risk being blown up by landmines A tragic alms race Nevertheless the food packets had a photoop all to themselves Their contents were listed in major newspapers They were vegetarian were told as per Muslim dietary law Each yellow packet decorated with the American flag contained rice peanut butter bean salad strawberry jam crackers raisins flat bread an apple fruit bar seasoning matches a set of plastic cutlery a serviette and illustrated user instructions After three years of unremitting drought an airdropped airline meal in Jalalabad The level of cultural ineptitude the failure to understand what months of relentless hunger and grinding poverty really mean the US governments attempt to use even this abject misery to boost its selfimage beggars description Reverse the scenario for a moment Imagine if the Taliban government was to bomb New York City saying all the while that its real target was the US government and its policies And suppose during breaks between the bombing the Taliban dropped a few thousand packets containing nan and kebabs impaled on an Afghan flag Would the good people of New York ever find it in themselves to forgive the Afghan government Even if they were hungry even if they needed the food even if they ate it how would they ever forget the insult the condescension Rudi Guiliani Mayor of New York City returned a gift of m from a Saudi prince because it came with a few words of friendly advice about American policy in the Middle East Is pride a luxury that only the rich are entitled to Far from stamping it out igniting this kind of rage is what creates terrorism Hate and retribution dont go back into the box once youve let them out For every terrorist or his supporter that is killed hundreds of innocent people are being killed too And for every hundred innocent people killed there is a good chance that several future terrorists will be created Where will it all lead Setting aside the rhetoric for a moment consider the fact that the world has not yet found an acceptable definition of what terrorism is One countrys terrorist is too often anothers freedom fighter At the heart of the matter lies the worlds deepseated ambivalence towards violence Once violence is accepted as a legitimate political instrument then the morality and political acceptability of terrorists insurgents or freedom fighters becomes contentious bumpy terrain The US government itself has funded armed and sheltered plenty of rebels and insurgents around the world The CIA and Pakistans ISI trained and armed the mojahedin who in the s were seen as terrorists by the government in Sovietoccupied Afghanistan Today Pakistan Americas ally in this new war sponsors insurgents who cross the border into Kashmir in India Pakistan lauds them as freedomfighters India calls them terrorists India for its part denounces countries who sponsor and abet terrorism but the Indian army has in the past trained separatist Tamil rebels asking for a homeland in Sri Lanka the LTTE responsible for countless acts of bloody terrorism Just as the CIA abandoned the mujahideen after they had served its purpose India abruptly turned its back on the LTTE for a host of political reasons It was an enraged LTTE suicide bomber who assassinated former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in It is important for governments and politicians to understand that manipulating these huge raging human feelings for their own narrow purposes may yield instant results but eventually and inexorably they have disastrous consequences Igniting and exploiting religious sentiments for reasons of political expediency is the most dangerous legacy that governments or politicians can bequeath to any people including their own People who live in societies ravaged by religious or communal bigotry know that every religious text from the Bible to the Bhagwad Gita can be mined and misinterpreted to justify anything from nuclear war to genocide to corporate globalisation This is not to suggest that the terrorists who perpetrated the outrage on September should not be hunted down and brought to book They must be But is war the best way to track them down Will burning the haystack find you the needle Or will it escalate the anger and make the world a living hell for all of us At the end of the day how many people can you spy on how many bank accounts can you freeze how many conversations can you eavesdrop on how many emails can you intercept how many letters can you open how many phones can you tap Even before September the CIA had accumulated more information than is humanly possible to process Sometimes too much data can actually hinder intelligence small wonder the US spy satellites completely missed the preparation that preceded Indias nuclear tests in The sheer scale of the surveillance will become a logistical ethical and civil rights nightmare It will drive everybody clean crazy And freedom that precious precious thing will be the first casualty Its already hurt and haemorrhaging dangerously Governments across the world are cynically using the prevailing paranoia to promote their own interests All kinds of unpredictable political forces are being unleashed In India for instance members of the All India Peoples Resistance Forum who were distributing antiwar and antiUS pamphlets in Delhi have been jailed Even the printer of the leaflets was arrested The rightwing government while it shelters Hindu extremists groups such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal has banned the Islamic Students Movement of India and is trying to revive an anti terrorist Act which had been withdrawn after the Human Rights Commission reported that it had been more abused than used Millions of Indian citizens are Muslim Can anything be gained by alienating them Every day that the war goes on raging emotions are being let loose into the world The international press has little or no independent access to the war zone In any case mainstream media particularly in the US have more or less rolled over allowing themselves to be tickled on the stomach with press handouts from military men and government officials Afghan radio stations have been destroyed by the bombing The Taliban has always been deeply suspicious of the press In the propaganda war there is no accurate estimate of how many people have been killed or how much destruction has taken place In the absence of reliable information wild rumours spread Put your ear to the ground in this part of the world and you can hear the thrumming the deadly drumbeat of burgeoning anger Please Please stop the war now Enough people have died The smart missiles are just not smart enough Theyre blowing up whole warehouses of suppressed fury President George Bush recently boasted When I take action Im not going to fire a m missile at a empty tent and hit a camel in the butt Its going to be decisive President Bush should know that there are no targets in Afghanistan that will give his missiles their moneys worth Perhaps if only to balance his books he should develop some cheaper missiles to use on cheaper targets and cheaper lives in the poor countries of the world But then that may not make good business sense to the coalitions weapons manufacturers It wouldnt make any sense at all for example to the Carlyle Group described by the Industry Standard as the worlds largest private equity firm with bn under management Carlyle invests in the defence sector and makes its money from military conflicts and weapons spending Carlyle is run by men with impeccable credentials Former US defence secretary Frank Carlucci is Carlyles chairman and managing director he was a college roommate of Donald Rumsfelds Carlyles other partners include former US secretary of state James A Baker III George Soros and Fred Malek George Bush Srs campaign manager An American paper shy the Baltimore Chronicle and Sentinel says that former president George Bush Sr is reported to be seeking investments for the Carlyle Group from Asian markets He is reportedly paid not inconsiderable sums of money to make presentations to potential governmentclients Ho hum As the tired saying goes its all in the family Then theres that other branch of traditional family business oil Remember President George Bush Jr and VicePresident Dick Cheney both made their fortunes working in the US oil industry Turkmenistan which borders the northwest of Afghanistan holds the worlds third largest gas reserves and an estimated six billion barrels of oil reserves Enough experts say to meet American energy needs for the next years or a developing countrys energy requirements for a couple of centuries America has always viewed oil as a security consideration and protected it by any means it deems necessary Few of us doubt that its military presence in the Gulf has little to do with its concern for human rights and almost entirely to do with its strategic interest in oil Oil and gas from the Caspian region currently moves northward to European markets Geographically and politically Iran and Russia are major impediments to American interests In Dick Cheney then CEO of Halliburton a major player in the oil industry said I cant think of a time when weve had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian Its almost as if the opportunities have arisen overnight True enough For some years now an American oil giant called Unocal has been negotiating with the Taliban for permission to construct an oil pipeline through Afghanistan to Pakistan and out to the Arabian sea From here Unocal hopes to access the lucrative emerging markets in south and southeast Asia In December a delegation of Taliban mullahs travelled to America and even met US state department officials and Unocal executives in Houston At that time the Talibans taste for public executions and its treatment of Afghan women were not made out to be the crimes against humanity that they are now Over the next six months pressure from hundreds of outraged American feminist groups was brought to bear on the Clinton administration Fortunately they managed to scuttle the deal And now comes the US oil industrys big chance In America the arms industry the oil industry the major media networks and indeed US foreign policy are all controlled by the same business combines Therefore it would be foolish to expect this talk of guns and oil and defence deals to get any real play in the media In any case to a distraught confused people whose pride has just been wounded whose loved ones have been tragically killed whose anger is fresh and sharp the inanities about the clash of civilisations and the good v evil discourse home in unerringly They are cynically doled out by government spokesmen like a daily dose of vitamins or antidepressants Regular medication ensures that mainland America continues to remain the enigma it has always been a curiously insular people administered by a pathologically meddlesome promiscuous government And what of the rest of us the numb recipients of this onslaught of what we know to be preposterous propaganda The daily consumers of the lies and brutality smeared in peanut butter and strawberry jam being airdropped into our minds just like those yellow food packets Shall we look away and eat because were hungry or shall we stare unblinking at the grim theatre unfolding in Afghanistan until we retch collectively and say in one voice that we have had enough As the first year of the new millennium rushes to a close one wonders have we forfeited our right to dream Will we ever be able to reimagine beauty Will it be possible ever again to watch the slow amazed blink of a newborn gecko in the sun or whisper back to the marmot who has just whispered in your ear without thinking of the World Trade Centre and Afghanistan Do You Yahoo Make a great connection at Yahoo Personals Do You Yahoo Make a great connection at Yahoo Personals

acwpdynAOctlanguageprinter Subscribe to The Post wpniother By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday October Page C Changing everyday habits doesnt come easily especially in making personal changes that conserve resources and protect the environment Think lights on in an empty room Think overpackaging of grocery products Think leaky faucets that drain the nations water resources drip by drip Thats why the folks at the Center for a New American Dream wwwnewdreamorg decided in July to take a different approach to encourage Americans to be environmentminded responsible consumers In launching its online program called Turn the Tide the Takoma Parkbased nonprofit group dedicated to helping Americans change how they consume was betting that results would speak for themselves The interactive volunteer program asks you to commit to taking nine simple actions in your daily lives over the next year None of these ecologically smart adjustments is such a big deal Each requires slight inconvenience but is easily achievable and produces a big payoff that is measurable The actions As simple as taking steps to cut our junk mail by half or replacing the standard light bulbs in our houses with energyefficient compact fluorescent units One suggestion is to skip a car trip each week The reason Automobile use is largely responsible for about a third of the nations greenhouse gas emissions says the center By measuring the effects of these ordinary actions the CNAD activists are counting on convincing Americans of the value of making small changes Each time a participant logs on to his personal Turn the Tide page to report his actions the sites calculator instantly totals the quantity of resources saved as well as the total savings of everyone in the program Eric Brown communications director at the Center for a New American Dream says this is a powerful tool that helps remind everyone involved that we are not alone and that small and simple everyday acts add up Weve signed up over people so far says Brown adding that a bunch of organizations are going to begin promoting the program to their memberships which should drive up these numbers soon The current participants he says will save over million gallons of water and prevent the release of over threequarter million pounds of carbon dioxide over the course of a year he says By and large our participants are really excited that they feel like theyre making a difference Recall Last week Wysco Inc recalled about Runt brand bicycles that contrary to Consumer Product Safety Commission standards were manufactured without any brakes The minibikes about inches long and inches high with sixinch wheels are red blue black or silver in color and display the word RUNT and a logo of a dogs face on the steering column Bicycle toy discount department convenience and specialty stores nationwide and mailorder catalogues and Web sites sold them from January through July If you own one call
