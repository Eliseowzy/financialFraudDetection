<2981935.1075859955137.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lhayman@skadden.com,2000-09-06 11:29:00,Re Sailingsent an email to Amanda to sound out her views My guess is that she will want to go several times Her usual response to a choice is to avoid it Since lots of things might work do you have any preferenceschoices Are you committed to an entire week Want to shorten it to a long weekend or is the travel to much of a pain for youI dont think there is any plan that will include Bill in If we include Amanda I think it is either Nov or it is Thanksgiving We could do a long weekend on either of those dates or if you want to take the whole week off you and I could go for the week and Amanda could join us for part of it I dont know how much time you want to spend on this venture Do you want to wait until Give me some idea what is your first second third choice And of course you can choose more than one I am sure Amanda will Linda Hayman Skadden ArpsSlate Meagher Flom LLP Times Square nd Floor New York NY T F PM Wow too many choices Lets see the day of the week charters start and end is not fixed except that the boat has to be available on the days you want it We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get weekends in and use the Saturday as a day to fly down Its much harder to get there from Houston than NYC fewer flights so it pretty much takes all day to get there The rd th is a Friday through Wed not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable I suppose it just means a day instead of day charter If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the of us particularly if we got one of the smaller boats and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing wont be all that challenging I hear the St Martin area can get rougher Plan B sounds like fun too and then we could all go together later it seems mean to go without Bill New Years sounds like a blast to me What would you think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before or and spending the first week of January there That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesnt have to be back in school til later I have a couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if youre interested in a slightly larger group Theyre a lot of fun good cooks and reasonable sailors too Linda Hayman To kad cc dencom Subject Re Sailing PM Amanda has a break from Nov th and I dont think she has classes on Friday anyway Is that something the three of us can work with Alternatively do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving with amanda joining for the long weekend fly down Thurs eve and back Mon I cant remember what day of the week charters begin and end is it set in stone Plan B we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until Of course that does make New Years eve a possibility If all else fails I did hear from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing And I am still looking for something to do over Christmas Linda Hayman Skadden ArpsSlate Meagher Flom LLP Times Square nd Floor New York NY T F Mark Taylor PM I sent Amanda Bill an email a couple of weeks ago and here is Bills reply I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which were the best times of year etc I havent heard anything from Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip Have you heard anything firm from Virginia Bills nexttolast paragraph tells me that hes getting to know Amanda but I dont think shell leave him alone for the holiday The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule too If they still want to go wed better make travel plans soon that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats If youd rather wait until Jan or Feb thats fine with me too Just let me know Forwarded by Mark TaylorHOUECT on PM WMcgovao lcom PM To cc Subject Re Welcome home Hey Mark nice to hear from you I am glad you enjoyed the wedding It went by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time Apart from a few travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular Tahiti is a true paradise I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is that my honeymoon has put me firmly in vacation deficit at the SEC Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean Amanda has told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another time Ill check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon How long to you go for Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda She has an uncanny ability to arrange her schedule

inline November Usage at default The newest weapon in the battle for rational pro rata Following the blowout on Compass Minerals B term loan institutional hot money may be back at least for the right credits While this is a very very good thing for the continuation of the leveraged loan market the question remains whether it is a good thing for pro rata lenders already suffering from a riskreturn mismatch A n oversubscription in the primary market is big news considering the past two months Following the events of September prices on transactable loans in the secondary market tumbled and investors found secondary yields to be far more rewarding than those in the primary market Suddenly loans in the primary market could not get done This realization was followed by a rash of upward flexes original issue discount loans and LIBOR floors The focus was squarely on fixing the institutional problem the pro rata problem was hardly discussed But despite taking a backseat in lender discourse the pro rata problem remains Even as institutional appetite fell by the wayside and struggling deals increased their pro rata tranches at the expense of floundering institutional facilities the economics of lending remain skewed away from banks That is not to say that pro rata syndication technology has not evolved Revolvers have been shrunk to their absolute minimum And while rumors of its death may be exaggerated the term loan A has almost been dropped from the pro rata equation and replaced with a term loan B that can be sold to both banks and institutions US bank deals to watch THAT SINKING FEELING Enron Corps BBBBaa Sr Unsec Debt Neg CreditWatch growing woes provided much food for thought before an abridged work week headed for the Thanksgiving holiday News of an impending debt repayment of million pummeled last week not only the value of outstanding Enron debt but it also highlighted growing doubts about its takeover by Dynegy Inc Simply put a default by Enron on its debt obligations would leave many lenders sitting on a sizable chunk of bad debt For the bank loan market Enrons quagmire poses rather unpalatable scenarios Of course for some banks there will be pressure to hold on to their exposure but for many others the challenge will be to find a tolerable market clearing price that will allow them to shed their exposure A LEVERAGED LOAN PIPELINE According to several market observers the window to bring to market a new leveraged deal if one exists is only going to be open for two more weeks at the most Therefore claims by many bankers that the only thing keeping them busy besides amendments and waivers are deals for sound extremely credible T ake for instance Northwest Natural Gas billion loan package backing its acquisition of Portland General Electric The deal promising million institutional paper is expected to hit market at the earliest by the second quarter of once regulatory approval is in hand The lead banks have already firmed the deal structure and are in the process of rounding up pro rata support The billion package will be distributed at both the holding and operating company level of the combined NW NaturalPGE entity At the holding company level which is expected to be rated investment grade or nearinvestment grade the facilities total billion including a sixyear pro rata deck split into a million revolver and a million term loan A The remainder of the holdco facilities is an million institutional deck split into a million year term loan B and a million year term loan C The balance of the holdco deck is a million capital markets facility The remainder of the financing package will be at the operating company level which is expected to retain a full investment grade profile This million deck runs for six years and consists of a million revolver for NW Natural and a million revolver for Portland General IN THE MEANTIME Before the year fizzles out there will be some deals too keep an eye open for Besides a prospective refinancing for Paragon Trade Brands a new deal is rumored for media concern Fisher Communications On the highgrade front Pitney Bowes soon is expected to approach its banks for a reduced rollover while mortgage lender Countrywide Funding preps a billion refinancing package with a sizable multiyear revolver HighYield Bonds Junk bond mutual funds summoned million of new cash in the week ended Tuesday according to AMG Data Services sending the funds about million above their preattack levels The funds lost nearly billion of investment in the weeks following the terrorist attacks before registering their first uptick in midOctober Heavily indebted cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products sold an upsized million issue of fouryear senior notes CaaB helped along by a bps spread over Treasuries attracted enough investor attention to raise the sale from an original million but bank sources declined to say how well books were filled out Meanwhile books on the Veterinary Centers of Americas million note sale were nearly seven times subscribed directly contrasting the concurrent and foundering million IPO The size of the Goldman Sachsled sale was increased from million of the A senior subordinated notes BB at pricing T he eightyear issue sold under the companys Vicar Operating subsidiary priced to yield bps over Treasuries Forward calendar volume appears to be building with bank sources indicating that the endgame for is going to be fairly busy especially as compared to the fourth quarters sluggish performance so far Ingles Markets heads out on the road tomorrow with a million deal with Radiologix Huntsman Corp Nextel Partners and Tommy Hilfiger soon to follow sources say Deutsche Bank has the mandate for a million placement for television station operator Young Broadcasting but the deal is subject to a successful consent solicitation that expires tomorrow at pm Majestic Star Casino and Global Auto Logistics still are on the road with pricing expected this week Secondary Last weeks holidayshortened period produced scant trading activity As new issue flow continues to disappoint the secondary market necessarily remains focused on outstanding supply Recently dealers have had their hands full with paydown situations THE FLAVOR OF THE WEEK LYONDELL Lyondell Chemicals term loan E spiked roughly three points last week to change hands near par in retail trading on Wednesday according to sources The surge was sparked by word of a proposed million senior secured note offering slated to repay the bulk of the TLE outstandings as well as all of the companys remaining TLB sources add The TLE however is noncall until next May when the call opens at the call steps down to in and the facility is callable at par thereafter and therefore a paydown would require an amendment to the credit agreement unless Lyondell were to solicit a tender offer a popular bond market method that has never been employed in the syndicated loan mart according to sources Today dealers are quoting Lyondells TLE in the roughly range with speculation buzzing that the company may try to pay down most or all of the millionplus tranche in the area As cyclical worries hit chemical credits in September Lyondells TLE dipped as low in street trading more than points off its impressive high set last year As of early last week however bids had strengthened soundly into the mids as dropping oil prices stirred up some hope for the beleaguered chemical industry The prior weeks paydown play Allied Waste held strong last week as a small slug of BC traded last Monday at Today with nearly of the companys term debt set to be repayed Allieds BC paper traded up to as a million and million stub changed hands in the street Allieds second senior note offering of the year upsized on Nov to million and is expected to take out nearly of the companys A B and C term loans leaving roughly billion of term debt outstanding On the stressed side after trading in the high s early the week prior Xerox Corps bank debt changed hands as high as last Tuesday in reaction to an announcement the previous Friday that the company intends to repay existing debt with proceeds from a now million up from an initial million convertible trust preferred securities offering The sale will help shore up Xeroxs balance sheet and will offer some cushion against a possible loan covenant violation sources note Middle Market Its never been more dead said one source achingly while hopefully anticipating a better deal flow for next year Across the hall at the workout desks however activity is ripe with action The source added dryly Those guys meanwhile are busy amending deals and scrutinizing collateral The time is not ripe for any one particular type of deal that could potentially have investors salivating But amidst the syndication melee some deals have managed to cross the scary hurdles San Diego Califbased Harvest Meat Co closed a million assetbased revolver with TransAmerica Business Capital The credit has a million sublimit for letters of credit and includes a fixed asset real estate term loan The fiveyear revolver is priced at LIB The term loan which is nonamortizing for the first months is priced at LIB with a bps LC fee Closing fees are and there is a bps commitment fee on the revolver Fleet Capital meanwhile has provided a million assetbased credit backing the buyout of Houstonbased Igloo Products Corp by Westar Capital Westar a private investment firm that also owns Del Monte Foods home healthcare firm Apria Healthcare and Doskocil Manufacturing is purchasing the Igloo Products unit from Lake Forest Illbased Brunswick Corp As with the previous two deals and the Nutraceutical International deal security is paramount Nutraceuticals recentlylaunched million fiveyear credit with sole lead arranger and administrative agent Rabobank is secured by substantially all of the companys assets sources noted Opening pricing is at LIB for the first days At that time pricing switches to an undisclosed leveragebased grid The commitment fee on the revolver is bps Commitments are due by Nov with the lead seeking million and

usual response to a choice is to avoid it Since lots of things might work do you have any preferenceschoices Are you committed to an entire week Want to shorten it to a long weekend or is the travel to much of a pain for youI dont think there is any plan that will include Bill in If we include Amanda I think it is either Nov or it is Thanksgiving We could do a long weekend on either of those dates or if you want to take the whole week off you and I could go for the week and Amanda could join us for part of it I dont know how much time you want to spend on this venture Do you want to wait until Give me some idea what is your first second third choice And of course you can choose more than one I am sure Amanda will Linda Hayman Skadden ArpsSlate Meagher Flom LLP Times Square nd Floor New York NY T F PM Wow too many choices Lets see the day of the week charters start and end is not fixed except that the boat has to be available on the days you want it We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get weekends in and use the Saturday as a day to fly down Its much harder to get there from Houston than NYC fewer flights so it pretty much takes all day to get there The rd th is a Friday through Wed not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable I suppose it just means a day instead of day charter If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the of us particularly if we got one of the smaller boats and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing wont be all that challenging I hear the St Martin area can get rougher Plan B sounds like fun too and then we could all go together later it seems mean to go without Bill New Years sounds like a blast to me What would you think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before or and spending the first week of January there That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesnt have to be back in school til later I have a couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if youre interested in a slightly larger group Theyre a lot of fun good cooks and reasonable sailors too Linda Hayman To kad cc dencom Subject Re Sailing PM Amanda has a break from Nov th and I dont think she has classes on Friday anyway Is that something the three of us can work with Alternatively do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving with amanda joining for the long weekend fly down Thurs eve and back Mon I cant remember what day of the week charters begin and end is it set in stone Plan B we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until Of course that does make New Years eve a possibility If all else fails I did hear from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing And I am still looking for something to do over Christmas Linda Hayman Skadden ArpsSlate Meagher Flom LLP Times Square nd Floor New York NY T F Mark Taylor PM I sent Amanda Bill an email a couple of weeks ago and here is Bills reply I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which were the best times of year etc I havent heard anything from Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip Have you heard anything firm from Virginia Bills nexttolast paragraph tells me that hes getting to know Amanda but I dont think shell leave him alone for the holiday The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule too If they still want to go wed better make travel plans soon that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats If youd rather wait until Jan or Feb thats fine with me too Just let me know Forwarded by Mark TaylorHOUECT on PM WMcgovao lcom PM To cc Subject Re Welcome home Hey Mark nice to hear from you I am glad you enjoyed the wedding It went by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time Apart from a few travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular Tahiti is a true paradise I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is that my honeymoon has put me firmly in vacation deficit at the SEC Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean Amanda has told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another time Ill check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon How long to you go for Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda She has an uncanny ability to arrange her schedule
