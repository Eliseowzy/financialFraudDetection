The last three weeks h ave led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besid es straight down There are many technology stocks trading at less than of their previous highs Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its m inimum bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will review the rule early next year Unlike most market environments individ ual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks a t these levels Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not allowed to hold stocks Many funds cannot hold stocks below and others have a threshold Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at thes e levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund oftentimes agains t their personal wishes and their own common sense Fund managers will be a ble to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above and We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very ove rsold In order to make the list the stock must be trading below the cash value the company has per share and have little or no debt We will try to publish this exciting edition next weekend We might call it the Riskless Rebound

oblivion of the range The stock is behaving as if there is some thing wrong with the company We spoke with management briefly this week about this issue At the corporate level nothing has changed Fiscal which ended at the end of September still looks like roughly million C DN in EBITDA profits As of right now business for fiscal looks about the same as The stock is trading at about times EBITDA The i ndustry average is currently times EBITDA Whats the explanation for this pathetic performance Simple management is doing nothing at this time to market their company to investors Their only audience is the memb ers of the OTC Journal A plan for a nationwide institutional road show w as in place prior to Attack on America but that is now on hold We can onl y hope management will wake up and recognize their responsibility to shareh olders and get proactive in telling their story Tax selling could hurt this stock so it could go lower One can only hope that despite management s failure to get out and tell their story someone will come along and rec ognize the inherent value in this company Bottom line Not worth selling at this price but it could go lower IMAGE Attention

slipping bel ow and respectively The thinking on Wall Street was dominated by the belief that the Enron accounting scandal was just the tip of the ice berg and other companys financial statements would come under increased s crutiny Behemoth multi national Tyco NYSE TYC was annihilated early in the week on fears they have been cooking the books It was disclosed one of their directors received a million payment for arranging an acquisi tion Many feel this was a blatant conflict of interest Telecommunicatio ns giant Global Crossing NYSE GX filed bankruptcy this week Chairman Ga ry Winnick

key clinical trial Harlan Waksal filed a Form with the SEC on Dec to sell million worth of ImClone stock Wall Street is afraid earnings and accounting scandals will dominate financial news fo r some time to come Arthur Andersen generated million in accounting fe es from Enron last year and companies like Enron have a lot of muscle with their auditors In order to win the business the consulting arm comes up with the tax avoidance scheme and earnings enhancement method and the audi ting division implements the strategy Like a weight lifter taking stero ids large cap companies are addicted to beefing up their financial perform ance at any cost And just like the weightlifter taking steroids this perf ormance enhancement is not only toxic long term it is also illegal In t he small and micro cap arena there is significant risk associated with fail ed corporate performance However these smaller companies do not have the fiscal muscle to make their auditors bend the rules to enhance financial pe rformance You wont see many small company scandals associated with accoun ting irregularities Their auditors take a much more conservative approach as the auditor is more concerned with

market is currently p lacing a value on the company of just over million Simply put this means Astralis can be purchased up to about per share before you are paying more than SkyePharma was willing to pay They are investing mil lion SkyePharmas revenues were up through the first six months of an explosive growth rate and the sign of a well managed company Loo k for this stock to start behaving better in Once the funding is comp leted Astralis will be positioned to apply for an upgraded listing to eith er the NASDAQ or the American Stock Exchange The risk associated with an investment in

University to amuse his children The poem was orig inally entitled A Visit From St Nicholas One year later it was publishe d anonymously in the Troy Sentinel submitted without the authors knowledg e by a house guest who obtained a copy A New York publisher later issued the poem and was advised nearly universally by critics of the time that i t was a waste of paper and ink However as usual the critics were wrong This unheralded verse managed to hang on and after the authors death it was illustrated with drawings from Thomas Nast and became very famous Th e author was Clement Clarke Moore and the poem began with the phrase Twas the night before Christmas So much for the critics Have a wonderfu l Christmas Remember the gifts that are around you are more precious than the gifts you unwrap IMAGE Envoy Communications NASDAQ ECGI Anno unces Year End Results Santa in Nowhere to be Found IMAGE Over the Lo ng Term Market Price Action Always Tells You Whats Happening Even When the Company Doesnt and the Market is Rarely Wrong The Editors of the OTC J ournal IMAGE Envoy Communications held a conference call this past week to discuss its fiscal year end results end of September Santa was nowhe re to be found Based on what we learned from the call the stock has droppe d from the mid range to just under in the past year because it deserv ed to The company revealed an abdominal th quarter where they lost million EBITDA Although they ended the year with just over million in revenues up and about million in EBITDA profits down the t rend towards losses is very disturbing We have been in a tough market en vironment for many companies and Envoy has not been left out Of the million the company lost in the th quarter million is attributed to s hutting down the Communiqu division and million was attributed to Sage Consulting their technology division which will probably continue to lose money The only bright spot was the performance of Watt Group their Int ernational design and consulting firm Watt is profitable and now represent s of the companys ongoing revenue stream As seen in the chart the recent rebound in the stock has dramatically reversed course as a result of this disclosure In our last edition on Envoy we felt the stock was destin ed for higher levels In the short term this past weeks financial disclos ure sabotaged our prediction Sadly we were wrong Its not the first time and it wont be the last However these financial results are a snapsho t of the past We are concerned with the future In the conference call the company indicated they expected to make million in EBITDA profits nex t year December quarterly numbers are expected to be lackluster and the y are expecting improvements in the March and June quarters The editors of the OTC Journal are very disappointed that management never gave any ong oing public disclosure concerning their th quarter performance Many compa nies are falling on hard times but most of them are choosing to inform the public as disappointments occur It is evident from the performance of t he stock that someone knew the company was doing so poorly Unfortunately it wasnt us We still believe the stock will rebound to the level al though it may take some time Recent new contract wins have resulted in sur ges in the stock price suggesting the market wants to believe again In the next week the stock may suffer from the final week of potential tax sel ling If you see the stock down near it should be bought for a January r ebound Still to come Year end wrap ups on XMLG big stuff happening the

microcosm of the B to B sector on the NASDAQ which was p ounded into oblivion In the late s Wall Streets enormous appetite for technology IPOs created an excess supply of technology in this sector

products vaporized tempor arily XML is a new universal computer language which allows large systems to communicate directly with each other Analysts have long recognized this new language will eventually dominate the B to B space Most importantly the implementation of this language saves companies money over the long run making its adoption inevitable However after having survived a challe

hospital chain Towards th e end of the summer the expansion was derailed by serious flooding in the H ouston area which led to the closing of several hospitals Shortly thereaf ter the September th Attack on America also slowed new contract roll outs New business is back on track and the company should report a relative ly strong fourth quarter Business should accelerate next year and the com
