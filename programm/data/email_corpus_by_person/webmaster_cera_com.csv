Eastern Europe URL eprofileuDmD Overview A comprehensive reform of gas legislation in Central and Eastern Europe is bringing the region in line with the European Unions Gas Directive This is true both for the countries expected to enter the Union by Czech Republic Estonia Hungary Poland and Sloveniaand f or candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decadeBulgaria Latvia Lithuania Romania and Slovakia In CERAs vi ew current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for t he internal gas market in Eastern and Central Europe look promising from an investors point of view The candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the EU Gas Directive during a twoday workshop held by th e European Commission and the World Bank in Paris in November Many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the s as part of their transition to a market economy The results have been mixed particularly in the utility industries The G as Directive adopted in August now offers a compelling incentive for EU candidate countries to transform their gas industries while providing a ro ad map to guide them The critical points relevant to harmonization between the European Union an d candidate countries include the following Legal framework and regulation The legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in Europe As a result in a ll candidate countries in energy laws were either updated or newl y established along the principles spelled out in the Gas Directive Regulato ry bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country althoug h issues of staffing financial autonomy and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved Thirdparty access TPA and longterm takeorpay contracts All candida te countries agree that TPA is a key to market competition Therefore all hav e adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation Although the Commission favors regulated TPA the specific approaches to TPA enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases In particular the implementation of TPA will have to address the issue of longterm takeorp ay contracts with Russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition Russian gas is for the most part sold to single traditional stateowned operators that dominate their internal markets A balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment This is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of Russian gas supplied in kind in exchang e for transit rights to West European customers Article of the directive provides for a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from takeorp ay obligations This derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the Russian gas industr y Furthermore article allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier to those with an emerging gas mar ket status or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state Most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the European Union Price crosssubsidies Residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a re financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers In various countries tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce This has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o f imported gas to oil prices All candidate countries have set legal framewor ks that include the phasing out of crosssubsidies as part of sector reform b ut the actual implementation will remain politically difficult As Table indicates price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte d to enter the European Union by middecade but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform The same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced EUcomplying energy laws and whose entry to the European Union is likely to happen in a longer time frame Unbundling Most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization To date unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie s In the future the Commission is likely to press all EU countries for legal separation structural unbundling of the businesses and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly Table gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries As t he table shows the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the Directive whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first

Monthly Briefing CERA Knowledge Area World Oil In the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market Furthermore the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals If the cutoff lasts through December the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions and exports may again cease At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect CERAs price outlook for remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for WTI However this outlook is based on OPECs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of WTI for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first The downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in OPEC output Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UNcontrolled oil for food program as of December in protest over the rejection by the Security Councils sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule Iraqs pricing was judged by the UN overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues Iraq partially resumed exporting on December Since then about mbd has been exported from the Mina alBakr terminal in the Persian Gulf Prior to the shutdown Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of mbd for November as compared with mbd for the third quarter Exports for November were about mbd from Mina alBakr and about mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market Iraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues In the midst of this dispute the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on December it became effective on December and has been accepted by Iraq As of December Iraqs revised export price for Ceyhan proposed for the remainder of December has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee Additionally the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina alBakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina alBakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina alBakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil As currently structured the deal would violate UN sanctions but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship The exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina alBakr again There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints Consequently the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook Iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office Secretary of Statedesignate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in Washington A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of mbd However only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd In CERAs view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition Switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage Given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil Supply Trends NonOPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production curtailed in October by about bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith Mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of Mexican liquids capacity Norways output increased bd from October to November as maintenance season ended Norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbd Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes Russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in November after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from July though October Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged mbd in Novemberdown mbd from the October level The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first days of December to roughly mbd Iraq resumed exports of about mbd on December which raised production to mbd Assuming no change in Iraqs current production stance Iraqi production would average mbd for December On a quarterly basis the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd These production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November without UN authorization and are continuing Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories DOE data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in September and reached million barrels in midDecember see Figure Since prices weakened in late November crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from million barrels Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up

Transmission Auctions Are Opening European Power Markets Email Category CERA Insight CERA Knowledge Area European Power Despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among European transmission system operators regulators and the European Commission in Florence auctions of international transmission capacity ITC in France the United Kingdom Denmark Belgium Italy Austria Switzerland Slovenia and the Netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the single European marketplace However the patchwork auctioning of access to ITC leaves important issues unresolved The most significant of these include the potential for gaming thirdparty transit and the allocation of auction proceeds As they stand these issues CERA believes are likely to lead to action at the European level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme Nevertheless current plans to open most of Europes ITC represent a watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in International Auctions Are Opening Markets A major portion of international transmission capacity on the Continent will be allocated by auction in see Table In CERAs view auctions for ITC are likely to have the greatest impact during in the following areas Increasing market transparency The posting of available transmission capacity on yearly monthly and daily bases will facilitate the markets efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity For the first time signals for new transmission investment power flows and transmission asset valuation will come from the market Increasing crossborder trade Although auctions may not reduce uncertainty in the marketplace initially the effect of heightened transparency in access rules and prices will soon work to increase trade Secondary markets for interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power products and work to increase the overall level of trade Increasing price correlation Auctions will replace nonmarketbased allocation methods such as longterm capacity reservation The dynamic character of shorterterm auctions combined with an expected secondary market for capacity should bring access to international capacity in line with the needs of the market In this way the market will be able to adjust more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate pricing points Increasing competition Once players have secured access to ITC at a given price they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the capacity into structured deals The result could be more aggressive maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike resulting in greater competition at the national level Reducing the competitiveness of imports The results of international transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported power into domestic markets Final prices offered for ITC will reflect the relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more expensive to import Spurring investment in transmission The money raised through auction could provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in upgrading international transmission links Access to international transmission capacity between the Netherlands Germany and Belgium in was auctioned for million euros see for details Auctions for access into Spain France and Italy are expected to realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets Connecting Rather than Integrating Markets Auctions between national grids or more accurately commercial grids are a pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis The auctions will open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission system operators Even so the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or the stated objectives of European policymakers In CERAs view the following issues may eventually bring down the hammer on ITC auctions Thirdparty transit The bilateral nature of ITC auctions perpetrates the problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit through a third grid This is ultimately inconsistent with the European Commissions objective of a single European power market The fact that physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always transit thirdparty grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach Transactionbased scheme Although still transactional in nature tied to a specific deal auctions fall within the European Commissions stated preference for marketbased mechanisms for allocating international transmission capacity It remains to be seen how successful this approach is in achieving integration of national markets Action at the European level could move allocation of ITC in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms such as market splitting counter trading or redispatching Gaming of auctions Auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most In practice it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided Even though most of the auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity tactical maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price of imported power Allocating auction proceeds One likely outcome of auctions will be the transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the rents currently reaped by other players This will works to raise the value of transmission assets relative to generation suppliers or traders It remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among transmission companies and the grid as transmission is still currently subject to monopoly regulation end Come Shoot the Rapids with

American Markets CERA Knowledge Areas Refined Products US Margin Highlights Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by per barrel to average per barrel during November Gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of at exceptionally high values CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year per barrel lower than this years first quarter average High sulfur No fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly averaging per barrel in November Despite the drop of per barrel from Octobers average fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values per barrel higher than a year ago and per barrel greater that the previous fiveyear average For the first quarter of CERA anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of per barrel in the first quarter Jetkerosene differentials versus WTI rose per barrel from the October average reaching a whopping per barrel in November In correspondence with the distillate market jetkerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals CERA expects jetkerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of per barrel Margins for US Gulf Coast sulfur residual fuel dropped by per barrel reaching per barrel below WTI during November Despite the recent widening of differentials CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months Residual fuel differentials are expected to average per barrel below WTI during the first quarter of next year at the high end of the historical range US Demand Highlights Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about million barrels per day mbd from the October level reaching mbd for the four weeks ending December Demand is averaging less than percent below last year largely because YK concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging mbd during the first quarter of Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at mbd for the four weeks ending December over percent greater than this time last year This represents a slight increase of about million barrels mb from the endOctober level of mb but still a record high level for early December With support from low home heating oil inventories particularly in the Northeast distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the October level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending December Despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average mb during the fourth quarter Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to mbd for the four weeks ending December a decline of about mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level Demand for residual fuel is currently percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the to mbd range during the first quarter of US Inventory Highlights Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to mb increasing almost mb from the endOctober value Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending December Forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter However CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December Despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period Primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever Although stocks are low CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter Assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December This moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months The rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from October reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks end This CERA

American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from

investors point of view The candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the EU Gas Directive during a twoday workshop held by th e European Commission and the World Bank in Paris in November Many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the s as part of their transition to a market economy The results have been mixed particularly in the utility industries The G as Directive adopted in August now offers a compelling incentive for EU candidate countries to transform their gas industries while providing a ro ad map to guide them The critical points relevant to harmonization between the European Union an d candidate countries include the following Legal framework and regulation The legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in Europe As a result in a ll candidate countries in energy laws were either updated or newl y established along the principles spelled out in the Gas Directive Regulato ry bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country althoug h issues of staffing financial autonomy and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved Thirdparty access TPA and longterm takeorpay contracts All candida te countries agree that TPA is a key to market competition Therefore all hav e adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation Although the Commission favors regulated TPA the specific approaches to TPA enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases In particular the implementation of TPA will have to address the issue of longterm takeorp ay contracts with Russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition Russian gas is for the most part sold to single traditional stateowned operators that dominate their internal markets A balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment This is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of Russian gas supplied in kind in exchang e for transit rights to West European customers Article of the directive provides for a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from takeorp ay obligations This derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the Russian gas industr y Furthermore article allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier to those with an emerging gas mar ket status or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state Most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the European Union Price crosssubsidies Residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a re financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers In various countries tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce This has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o f imported gas to oil prices All candidate countries have set legal framewor ks that include the phasing out of crosssubsidies as part of sector reform b ut the actual implementation will remain politically difficult As Table indicates price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte d to enter the European Union by middecade but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform The same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced EUcomplying energy laws and whose entry to the European Union is likely to happen in a longer time frame Unbundling Most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization To date unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie s In the future the Commission is likely to press all EU countries for legal separation structural unbundling of the businesses and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly Table gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries As t he table shows the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the Directive whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first

Monthly Briefing CERA Knowledge Area World Oil In the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market Furthermore the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals If the cutoff lasts through December the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions and exports may again cease At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect CERAs price outlook for remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for WTI However this outlook is based on OPECs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of WTI for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first The downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in OPEC output Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UNcontrolled oil for food program as of December in protest over the rejection by the Security Councils sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule Iraqs pricing was judged by the UN overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues Iraq partially resumed exporting on December Since then about mbd has been exported from the Mina alBakr terminal in the Persian Gulf Prior to the shutdown Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of mbd for November as compared with mbd for the third quarter Exports for November were about mbd from Mina alBakr and about mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market Iraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues In the midst of this dispute the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on December it became effective on December and has been accepted by Iraq As of December Iraqs revised export price for Ceyhan proposed for the remainder of December has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee Additionally the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina alBakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina alBakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina alBakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil As currently structured the deal would violate UN sanctions but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship The exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina alBakr again There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints Consequently the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook Iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office Secretary of Statedesignate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in Washington A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of mbd However only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd In CERAs view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition Switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage Given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil Supply Trends NonOPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production curtailed in October by about bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith Mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of Mexican liquids capacity Norways output increased bd from October to November as maintenance season ended Norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbd Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes Russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in November after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from July though October Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged mbd in Novemberdown mbd from the October level The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first days of December to roughly mbd Iraq resumed exports of about mbd on December which raised production to mbd Assuming no change in Iraqs current production stance Iraqi production would average mbd for December On a quarterly basis the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd These production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November without UN authorization and are continuing Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories DOE data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in September and reached million barrels in midDecember see Figure Since prices weakened in late November crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from million barrels Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the United States In November stocks rose nearly million barrels to million barrels At this level they are below the highs of but well above the low levels of early see Figure Japanese crude oil inventories at endOctober were million barrels which is above the record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent years see Figure Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids

Transmission Auctions Are Opening European Power Markets Email Category CERA Insight CERA Knowledge Area European Power Despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among European transmission system operators regulators and the European Commission in Florence auctions of international transmission capacity ITC in France the United Kingdom Denmark Belgium Italy Austria Switzerland Slovenia and the Netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the single European marketplace However the patchwork auctioning of access to ITC leaves important issues unresolved The most significant of these include the potential for gaming thirdparty transit and the allocation of auction proceeds As they stand these issues CERA believes are likely to lead to action at the European level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme Nevertheless current plans to open most of Europes ITC represent a watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in International Auctions Are Opening Markets A major portion of international transmission capacity on the Continent will be allocated by auction in see Table In CERAs view auctions for ITC are likely to have the greatest impact during in the following areas Increasing market transparency The posting of available transmission capacity on yearly monthly and daily bases will facilitate the markets efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity For the first time signals for new transmission investment power flows and transmission asset valuation will come from the market Increasing crossborder trade Although auctions may not reduce uncertainty in the marketplace initially the effect of heightened transparency in access rules and prices will soon work to increase trade Secondary markets for interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power products and work to increase the overall level of trade Increasing price correlation Auctions will replace nonmarketbased allocation methods such as longterm capacity reservation The dynamic character of shorterterm auctions combined with an expected secondary market for capacity should bring access to international capacity in line with the needs of the market In this way the market will be able to adjust more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate pricing points Increasing competition Once players have secured access to ITC at a given price they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the capacity into structured deals The result could be more aggressive maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike resulting in greater competition at the national level Reducing the competitiveness of imports The results of international transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported power into domestic markets Final prices offered for ITC will reflect the relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more expensive to import Spurring investment in transmission The money raised through auction could provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in upgrading international transmission links Access to international transmission capacity between the Netherlands Germany and Belgium in was auctioned for million euros see for details Auctions for access into Spain France and Italy are expected to realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets Connecting Rather than Integrating Markets Auctions between national grids or more accurately commercial grids are a pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis The auctions will open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission system operators Even so the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or the stated objectives of European policymakers In CERAs view the following issues may eventually bring down the hammer on ITC auctions Thirdparty transit The bilateral nature of ITC auctions perpetrates the problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit through a third grid This is ultimately inconsistent with the European Commissions objective of a single European power market The fact that physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always transit thirdparty grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach Transactionbased scheme Although still transactional in nature tied to a specific deal auctions fall within the European Commissions stated preference for marketbased mechanisms for allocating international transmission capacity It remains to be seen how successful this approach is in achieving integration of national markets Action at the European level could move allocation of ITC in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms such as market splitting counter trading or redispatching Gaming of auctions Auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most In practice it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided Even though most of the auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity tactical maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price of imported power Allocating auction proceeds One likely outcome of auctions will be the transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the rents currently reaped by other players This will works to raise the value of transmission assets relative to generation suppliers or traders It remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among transmission companies and the grid as transmission is still currently subject to monopoly regulation end Come Shoot the Rapids with

American Markets CERA Knowledge Areas Refined Products US Margin Highlights Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by per barrel to average per barrel during November Gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of at exceptionally high values CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year per barrel lower than this years first quarter average High sulfur No fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly averaging per barrel in November Despite the drop of per barrel from Octobers average fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values per barrel higher than a year ago and per barrel greater that the previous fiveyear average For the first quarter of CERA anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of per barrel in the first quarter Jetkerosene differentials versus WTI rose per barrel from the October average reaching a whopping per barrel in November In correspondence with the distillate market jetkerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals CERA expects jetkerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of per barrel Margins for US Gulf Coast sulfur residual fuel dropped by per barrel reaching per barrel below WTI during November Despite the recent widening of differentials CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months Residual fuel differentials are expected to average per barrel below WTI during the first quarter of next year at the high end of the historical range US Demand Highlights Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about million barrels per day mbd from the October level reaching mbd for the four weeks ending December Demand is averaging less than percent below last year largely because YK concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging mbd during the first quarter of Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at mbd for the four weeks ending December over percent greater than this time last year This represents a slight increase of about million barrels mb from the endOctober level of mb but still a record high level for early December With support from low home heating oil inventories particularly in the Northeast distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the October level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending December Despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average mb during the fourth quarter Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to mbd for the four weeks ending December a decline of about mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level Demand for residual fuel is currently percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the to mbd range during the first quarter of US Inventory Highlights Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to mb increasing almost mb from the endOctober value Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending December Forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter However CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December Despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period Primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever Although stocks are low CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter Assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December This moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months The rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from October reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks end This CERA

American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from

<17198335.1075856378728.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,webmaster@cera.com,2000-12-13 12:25:00,California on the BrinkCERA AlertAlert December Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from

during the fall of CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the October level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending December Despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average mb during the fourth quarter Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to mbd for the four weeks ending December a decline of about mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level Demand for residual fuel is currently percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the to mbd range during the first quarter of US Inventory Highlights Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to mb increasing almost mb from the endOctober value Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending December Forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter However CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December Despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period Primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever Although stocks are low CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter Assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December This moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months The rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from October reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks end This CERA

Transmission Auctions Are Opening European Power Markets Email Category CERA Insight CERA Knowledge Area European Power Despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among European transmission system operators regulators and the European Commission in Florence auctions of international transmission capacity ITC in France the United Kingdom Denmark Belgium Italy Austria Switzerland Slovenia and the Netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the single European marketplace However the patchwork auctioning of access to ITC leaves important issues unresolved The most significant of these include the potential for gaming thirdparty transit and the allocation of auction proceeds As they stand these issues CERA believes are likely to lead to action at the European level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme Nevertheless current plans to open most of Europes ITC represent a watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in International Auctions Are Opening Markets A major portion of international transmission capacity on the Continent will be allocated by auction in see Table In CERAs view auctions for ITC are likely to have the greatest impact during in the following areas Increasing market transparency The posting of available transmission capacity on yearly monthly and daily bases will facilitate the markets efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity For the first time signals for new transmission investment power flows and transmission asset valuation will come from the market Increasing crossborder trade Although auctions may not reduce uncertainty in the marketplace initially the effect of heightened transparency in access rules and prices will soon work to increase trade Secondary markets for interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power products and work to increase the overall level of trade Increasing price correlation Auctions will replace nonmarketbased allocation methods such as longterm capacity reservation The dynamic character of shorterterm auctions combined with an expected secondary market for capacity should bring access to international capacity in line with the needs of the market In this way the market will be able to adjust more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate pricing points Increasing competition Once players have secured access to ITC at a given price they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the capacity into structured deals The result could be more aggressive maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike resulting in greater competition at the national level Reducing the competitiveness of imports The results of international transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported power into domestic markets Final prices offered for ITC will reflect the relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more expensive to import Spurring investment in transmission The money raised through auction could provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in upgrading international transmission links Access to international transmission capacity between the Netherlands Germany and Belgium in was auctioned for million euros see for details Auctions for access into Spain France and Italy are expected to realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets Connecting Rather than Integrating Markets Auctions between national grids or more accurately commercial grids are a pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis The auctions will open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission system operators Even so the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or the stated objectives of European policymakers In CERAs view the following issues may eventually bring down the hammer on ITC auctions Thirdparty transit The bilateral nature of ITC auctions perpetrates the problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit through a third grid This is ultimately inconsistent with the European Commissions objective of a single European power market The fact that physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always transit thirdparty grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach Transactionbased scheme Although still transactional in nature tied to a specific deal auctions fall within the European Commissions stated preference for marketbased mechanisms for allocating international transmission capacity It remains to be seen how successful this approach is in achieving integration of national markets Action at the European level could move allocation of ITC in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms such as market splitting counter trading or redispatching Gaming of auctions Auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most In practice it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided Even though most of the auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity tactical maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price of imported power Allocating auction proceeds One likely outcome of auctions will be the transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the rents currently reaped by other players This will works to raise the value of transmission assets relative to generation suppliers or traders It remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among transmission companies and the grid as transmission is still currently subject to monopoly regulation end Come Shoot the Rapids with

Monthly Briefing CERA Knowledge Area World Oil In the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market Furthermore the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals If the cutoff lasts through December the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions and exports may again cease At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect CERAs price outlook for remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for WTI However this outlook is based on OPECs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of WTI for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first The downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in OPEC output Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UNcontrolled oil for food program as of December in protest over the rejection by the Security Councils sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule Iraqs pricing was judged by the UN overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues Iraq partially resumed exporting on December Since then about mbd has been exported from the Mina alBakr terminal in the Persian Gulf Prior to the shutdown Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of mbd for November as compared with mbd for the third quarter Exports for November were about mbd from Mina alBakr and about mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market Iraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues In the midst of this dispute the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on December it became effective on December and has been accepted by Iraq As of December Iraqs revised export price for Ceyhan proposed for the remainder of December has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee Additionally the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina alBakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina alBakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina alBakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil As currently structured the deal would violate UN sanctions but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship The exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina alBakr again There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints Consequently the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook Iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office Secretary of Statedesignate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in Washington A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of mbd However only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd In CERAs view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition Switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage Given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil Supply Trends NonOPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production curtailed in October by about bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith Mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of Mexican liquids capacity Norways output increased bd from October to November as maintenance season ended Norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbd Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes Russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in November after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from July though October Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged mbd in Novemberdown mbd from the October level The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first days of December to roughly mbd Iraq resumed exports of about mbd on December which raised production to mbd Assuming no change in Iraqs current production stance Iraqi production would average mbd for December On a quarterly basis the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd These production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November without UN authorization and are continuing Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories DOE data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in September and reached million barrels in midDecember see Figure Since prices weakened in late November crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from million barrels Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the United States In November stocks rose nearly million barrels to million barrels At this level they are below the highs of but well above the low levels of early see Figure Japanese crude oil inventories at endOctober were million barrels which is above the record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent years see Figure Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids

Eastern Europe URL eprofileuDmD Overview A comprehensive reform of gas legislation in Central and Eastern Europe is bringing the region in line with the European Unions Gas Directive This is true both for the countries expected to enter the Union by Czech Republic Estonia Hungary Poland and Sloveniaand f or candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decadeBulgaria Latvia Lithuania Romania and Slovakia In CERAs vi ew current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for t he internal gas market in Eastern and Central Europe look promising from an investors point of view The candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the EU Gas Directive during a twoday workshop held by th e European Commission and the World Bank in Paris in November Many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the s as part of their transition to a market economy The results have been mixed particularly in the utility industries The G as Directive adopted in August now offers a compelling incentive for EU candidate countries to transform their gas industries while providing a ro ad map to guide them The critical points relevant to harmonization between the European Union an d candidate countries include the following Legal framework and regulation The legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in Europe As a result in a ll candidate countries in energy laws were either updated or newl y established along the principles spelled out in the Gas Directive Regulato ry bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country althoug h issues of staffing financial autonomy and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved Thirdparty access TPA and longterm takeorpay contracts All candida te countries agree that TPA is a key to market competition Therefore all hav e adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation Although the Commission favors regulated TPA the specific approaches to TPA enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases In particular the implementation of TPA will have to address the issue of longterm takeorp ay contracts with Russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition Russian gas is for the most part sold to single traditional stateowned operators that dominate their internal markets A balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment This is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of Russian gas supplied in kind in exchang e for transit rights to West European customers Article of the directive provides for a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from takeorp ay obligations This derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the Russian gas industr y Furthermore article allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier to those with an emerging gas mar ket status or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state Most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the European Union Price crosssubsidies Residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a re financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers In various countries tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce This has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o f imported gas to oil prices All candidate countries have set legal framewor ks that include the phasing out of crosssubsidies as part of sector reform b ut the actual implementation will remain politically difficult As Table indicates price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte d to enter the European Union by middecade but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform The same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced EUcomplying energy laws and whose entry to the European Union is likely to happen in a longer time frame Unbundling Most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization To date unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie s In the future the Commission is likely to press all EU countries for legal separation structural unbundling of the businesses and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly Table gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries As t he table shows the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the Directive whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first

American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from

<23917067.1075858071817.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,webmaster@cera.com,2000-12-13 12:18:00,California on the Brink CERA AlertAlert Dcember Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from

<11860683.1075858077549.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,webmaster@cera.com,2000-12-13 12:18:00,California on the Brink CERA AlertAlert Dcember Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from

<10767642.1075858077669.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,webmaster@cera.com,2000-12-13 12:18:00,California on the Brink CERA AlertAlert Dcember Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within hours This electronic message and attachments if any contain information from
