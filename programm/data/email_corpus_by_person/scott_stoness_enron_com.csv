cc harry kingerski Subject Draft Testimony re PGESCE for Discussion Summary The CPUC should implement two part RTPTOU rates for PGESCE A two part rate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of normal load and pay market value for consumption incremental or decremental to normal load The CPUC should define normal consumption as consumption over and above of historical consumption The CPUC should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by DWR for spot purchases in that hour In the event that implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is complicated to design the MWh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is possible The current draft design of the CPUC is discriminatory to large customers The current draft design of the CPUC does not provide appropriate price signals The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are unneccessarly high The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are far in excess of those which the CPUC intended The current draft design of the CPUC results is static and does not respond to changing market conditions Design Goals The CPUC should design rates that Give appropriate price signals to customers to consume conserve energy as as close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible Treat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner Achieve targeted revenue requirements Are easy to administer and understand Summary of CPUC Illustrative Design The CPUC has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to marginal rates Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in Summer Weekdays from noon to PM Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in all other hours Critique based on Design Goals Draft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short The rates for power Mar based on DJNP on peak is MWh The rates for power Mar based on DJNP off peak is MWh The proposed marginal rates for E Secondary is MWh for on peak and off peak This rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in lower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods Draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis E Transmission Voltage customers will experience a rate increase E Secondary voltage customers will experience a rate increase A Medium General Service customers will experience a rate increase A Small LP customers will experience a rate increase The marginal price signal for A will be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the on peak summer The marginal price signal for E wills be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the off peak periods PGE has a longer summer period than SCE This results in a increase for SCE TOUSub as compared to increases for PGE E Transmission rate The proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for SCE customers than PGE customers For example the on peak rate for SCE TOUSub is MWh as compared to PGE E Transmission rate of MWh Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue Draft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge increase does not ocur until May for PGE and June for SCE it should be possible to implement Enron Proposed Rates Enron proposes Two part real time pricing time of use rate Usage up to of historical use would be billed at historical rates Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak where customers has real time metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has time of use metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at of DJNP On Peak and of DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has just energy metering Critique based on Design Goals Enron proposals charge all customer at very close to marginal rates Thus within the constraints of using Dow Jones the rates should be very close to the actual marginal rates The rates will not be exact because they are Determined on the previous day Ony differentiate between on and off peak as compared to hour by hour To the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability the rates will be determined on a class average basis However the rates be far superior to the CPUC draft design because They give better price signals to night consumption They give better signals to weekend consumption They give better signals to winter consumption They are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of marginal costs For example if summer costs are lower the rate will be lower The Enron proposal will motivate DSM activities in winter summer and off peak Enron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of utility and rate class The Enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial as with residential ABX provides that residential customers that consume energy below normal rates will not have increased rates This design also achieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue but even more importantly it ensures tracking of costs Setting the normal load at of historical load results in a MWh increase if the market value for the entire year is MWh In the event that the market value for the entire year is less than MWh the resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue The Enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can easily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price signals and revenue targets The revenue outcome is less certain than the CPUC draft design however the impact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up when the costs go up Draft proposal require greater implementation details than the CPUC design but such extra costs are worthwhile The Enron proposal requires Determination of historical loads for large customers Determination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers Determination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers Determination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new customer Then Enron proposal has the following negatives Some customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better off even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new price signals The rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different for each customer The rates may take more work to put in place for the utility The rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates depending upon the historical consumption of the customers Q In the event that it is not possible to implement the Enron rates by June what would you propose a an interim solution A The CPUC draft rates are so flawed that it would be superior to just implement a flat MWh surcharge to all customers This approach would be fairer and simpler Q Who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers A The DWR will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in rates of the utilities The are indifferent to buy more generation or selling less energy to customers Thus the DWR should be willing to pay for decremental consumption In the event that the DWR is not agreeable to paying for decremental consumption the utility should be allowed to borrow such funds and have the costs amortized for the next years In the event that the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption the normal load could be defined of historical and the CPUC could eliminate credits resulting from decremental consumption Such solution would discourage conservation below but would not be expected to diminish the effectiveness of the Enron proposed rates Q Why is DJNP the right index to choose A DJNP and DJSP are availble for each weekday for on and off peak pricing The index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day for today The DJ index is compiled based on the information provided by many of the large trading companies including Enron The numbers provided by the participants are subject to audit Thus DJ is the best avaible information available for energy pricing Q What index is suitable for weekends A Enron proposes that the average DJNP off peak energy charges for friday and monday be used to determine the weekend rates for the purpose of rate setting

<26313894.1075843436284.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,scott.stoness@enron.com,2001-04-20 10:17:00,RE SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Cc of AB is that it says that The price paid by DA customers shall not be more than the frozen tariff And the CPUC has implemented this by creating the Px credit equal to the current market This interpretation has been supported by months of practice and lots of hearings if that means anything So my interpretation is that although the AB does not explicity require Px credits to be based on market it does require the total effect to be that the DA customers not pay more than the frozen rates which the CPUC previously interpreted in the only logical method available that there needs to be a credit equal to the market value of commodity on the customers bill This give the CPUC the latitude to change the Px but requires them to add some other credit that brings the rates down to rates if they deviate from it So although I agree that the bill does not force Px to be equal to market value I think it does force it to be equal to market value given the structure that they have assumed Scott MDay MSSRcom on PM To cc JBennett MSSRcom MDay MSSRcom Subject RE SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Jeff is correct that AB said NOTHING about direct access credits said nothing about whether such credits were to be market based or whether direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power providers All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC in their approval of the direct access tariff rules Rule and in their implementation of the utility cost recovery plans the calculation of CTC Therefore we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis We can still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE credit based just on Edisons cost of generation retained generation plus QFs plus DWR purchases but we have to recognize that it the number is higher than the PE credit we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to direct access providers from the utilitys bundled customers I do not expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy The bottom up tariff structure is a much more likely result at this point Mike Day Original Message From mailto Sent Friday April PM To Cc JBennett MSSRcom Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Looks good Scott One thing I admit Im not a lawyer so someone needs to show me the precise language in AB that requires the credit which I believe was created by the PUC not the legislature to be based on market and requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers Mike Day Do you concur with Scotts interpretation in AB Like your arguments Scott Just want to clarify that were on solid legal ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief andor protest Best Jeff Scott ES To JBennett MSSRcom ENRON cc Harry nron Tamara ES Leslie ES AM Jeff nron Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit ProtestDocument link Jeff Dasovich We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that the Px credit should be based on DJNP and DJSP rather than the defunct Px because AB requires it to be based on market not costs Changing to procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB which requires DA customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJNPSP that is the only appropriate available method Further the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA customers should be charged the generation surcharges DA customers should be given market based Px credits based on DJNPSP because its the law There are possible interpretations resulting from the combination of AB and the new law The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any surcharge The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the surcharges Interpretation results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other customers It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent Interpretation results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other customers until the end of AB This seems like the likely interpretation since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB Thus given that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the rate freeze ends Once the Px credit ends Mar the surcharge should end because the law AB no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should not be charged for them In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value if the courts interpret the law differently than Enron then there should be no generation surcharge for DA customers This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting Scott JBennett MSSRcom on AM To Harry Kingerski Email Robert Neustaedter Email Scott Stoness Email Tamara Johnson Business Fax IMCEAFAXTamaraJohnsonBGMSSRcom cc Jeff Dasovich Email Sue

questions Attached are the proposed answers Comments to Davis regarding some Speculated Solutions State could build generation The real issue is not who builds but that generation gets built in California Any generation that is built in California will reduce problems because it will displace load Displace load will cause lower demand which in turn wi ll result in lower market prices new supplydemand balance Our proposal RFP of MW will allow all kinds of proposals including ownership by government to explore It is okay for the government to build generation but it should not result in any different outcome than anyone else building Output of existing generation at cost Output of existing utility generation should be sold at cost Utilities that caused the mess should not benefit All customers including those being served by other suppliers paid for these utilities when they were below market They should get their share o f benefits of the existing assets now at cost Municipal utilities could be required to sell their excess generation in California The problem we are incurring are related to government intervention ie price caps and illiquidity causing uncertainty that causes California utilities to desire to sell outside of the state Removal of price caps will keep municipal generation in the state There is no need to mandate that it stay within California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation This solution is a great idea which is included in our pitch As indicated we are advocating a CPUC process of RFPs that would inclu de universities This is a superior method because universities are slow to act and we need solution by summer Expand instate gas production No comment on this specific solution However Enron notes that the QF s have rate that are linked to gas The Government should explore requiring the QFs to buy gas forward and sell at costs for to years to lock in low costs The real issue related to gas is increasing gas capacity Any increase in gas production in California or new pipeline into California would do much to reduce electricity costs Governor Davis should ask the the California Energy Commission to explore ways to increase gas supplies in much the same manner suggested previously for electricity Take state lands gas royalties in kind No comment aside from above Negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for additional gas supplies No comment aside from above Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time This solution should not be necessary if no entity holds too much market power and entities are exposed to market price They will seek to maintain their assets such that they are available in high cost times Generators that are paid on a fixed price basis are at risk to doing bad maintenance timing Thus a committee to review maintenance timing of QFs utility owned generation would be appropriate Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer termin state The governor should not cause generation builders more risk Whats important is that generation be built in California nothing else Any extra risk will cause less generation to be built Emission trading should be made right for all generation built in Californi a Condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state Whats important is that generation be built in California nothing else Any extra risk will cause less generation to be built Securitize uncollected power purchase costs This is a great idea if made available to all customers We are suggesting that hedging be done through entities bidding on standard offer using the benefits of existing utility generation and securitization Utilities are not good at hedging so those that are good should bid on default supplier status Allowing securitization of these hedging costs would allow lower rates whic h is a good thing Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hea r more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders

California Edison Applauds Court Findings in Lawsuit Against CPUC Southern California Edison Company SCE today released the following statement in response to todays expedited decision by the US District Court upholding the utilitys right to recover the costs of purchasing power for its customers ROSEMEAD Calif Jan SCE applauded todays decision by US District Court Judge Ronald SW Lew upholding the central claim of our lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission CPUCour right to recover the reasonable costs of purchasing power for our customers This ruling is an important step toward rebuilding the financial stability of Californias electric power system The court found that a trial is needed on the question of whether SCEs purchases were prudent We believe we will prevail on that issue too because the CPUC has repeatedly held that purchases made through Californias Power Exchange and Independent System Operator are by definition reasonable We will work with the CPUC to implement a schedule for the reasonable recovery of our costs We filed the lawsuit on Nov asking the federal court to overturn rulings by the CPUC that illegally prevent it from the reasonable recovery of operating costs for purchasing power it has been forced to incur on behalf of our customers We believe that the five members of the commission violated federal law when after requiring us to procure wholesale power for its customers from the states newly deregulated wholesale market and to sell it without markup the commission blocked us from recovering the full cost of doing so Our lawsuit was made necessary by the commissions refusal over the past eight months to heed warnings that its policies breach federal law and unfairly place the company and our customers in jeopardy In the lawsuit we noted that we incurred undercollections the difference between outofcontrol wholesale power costs and frozen retail rates approaching billion that have seriously weakened our financial integrity and service reliability This suit is one of many steps we are taking to attempt to remedy serious market problems that threaten the ability of the states major utilities to continue serving their customers We are pursuing every possible means of protecting our customers and shareholders from Californias dysfunctional electricity market An Edison International company Southern California Edison is one of the nations largest electric utilities serving a population of more than million via million customer accounts in a squaremile service area within central coastal and Southern California

same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us I t also accomodates the problem of RFPs taking longer than expected It also solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for

RegionThe Bentley xchange Dirk vanUldenWestern RegionThe Bentley xchange Steve ES Jennifer ES cc Subject Quick Update On the various matters currently before the California PUC The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between DWRs cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect The order only applies however to the power purchased under the Governors emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether but if the Commission didnt want to vacate the order it would need to change the decision so that the IOUs dont eat any shortfalls The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses In addition it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week So the opportunity to act and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it With respect to the cost of utility generation ie retained generating assets and QF contracts the Commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a Commission decision adopting an interim procurement charge on March th There is another workshop scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities proposals after which the utilities will be required to file formal advice letters with the Commission Those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the th Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that DWR incurs to buy power Everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for DWRs costs and the Commission will if necessary raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole Unfortunately the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops And until there is clarity on whether the Commission will agree to pass through those costs Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWRs credit as it applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays ie the utilities financial position TURNs proposal to net out the utilitities generationrelated revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap the date on which the rate has or will end etc Recently TURN modified its testimony in response to the passage of ABX TURNs new position is that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February st the effective date of ABX EES will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to TURNs latest stance on the end of the rate freeze We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities stranded generating assets That compensation could come in one of two forms access to a proportionate share of the utilities retained costbased generating assets or a credit representing the difference between the market value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets We are not getting much traction thus far The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue the issue of whether to net out generatingrelated revenues against the undercollection etc on March So both sets of issues the procurement charges and the end of the rate freeze are scheduled to be finalized on March albeit in separate orders With respect to the Block Foward issue our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers However it has become clear that despite those efforts FERCs decision on charge backs will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward issue Best Jeff

not be more than the frozen tariff And the CPUC has implemented this by creating the Px credit equal to the current market This interpretation has been supported by months of practice and lots of hearings if that means anything So my interpretation is that although the AB does not explicity require Px credits to be based on market it does require the total effect to be that the DA customers not pay more than the frozen rates which the CPUC previously interpreted in the only logical method available that there needs to be a credit equal to the market value of commodity on the customers bill This give the CPUC the latitude to change the Px but requires them to add some other credit that brings the rates down to rates if they deviate from it So although I agree that the bill does not force Px to be equal to market value I think it does force it to be equal to market value given the structure that they have assumed Scott MDay MSSRcom on PM To cc JBennett MSSRcom MDay MSSRcom Subject RE SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Jeff is correct that AB said NOTHING about direct access credits said nothing about whether such credits were to be market based or whether direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power providers All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC in their approval of the direct access tariff rules Rule and in their implementation of the utility cost recovery plans the calculation of CTC Therefore we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis We can still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE credit based just on Edisons cost of generation retained generation plus QFs plus DWR purchases but we have to recognize that it the number is higher than the PE credit we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to direct access providers from the utilitys bundled customers I do not expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy The bottom up tariff structure is a much more likely result at this point Mike Day Original Message From mailto Sent Friday April PM To Cc JBennett MSSRcom Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Looks good Scott One thing I admit Im not a lawyer so someone needs to show me the precise language in AB that requires the credit which I believe was created by the PUC not the legislature to be based on market and requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers Mike Day Do you concur with Scotts interpretation in AB Like your arguments Scott Just want to clarify that were on solid legal ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief andor protest Best Jeff Scott ES To JBennett MSSRcom ENRON cc Harry nron Tamara ES Leslie ES AM Jeff nron Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit ProtestDocument link Jeff Dasovich We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that the Px credit should be based on DJNP and DJSP rather than the defunct Px because AB requires it to be based on market not costs Changing to procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB which requires DA customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJNPSP that is the only appropriate available method Further the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA customers should be charged the generation surcharges DA customers should be given market based Px credits based on DJNPSP because its the law There are possible interpretations resulting from the combination of AB and the new law The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any surcharge The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the surcharges Interpretation results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other customers It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent Interpretation results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other customers until the end of AB This seems like the likely interpretation since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB Thus given that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the rate freeze ends Once the Px credit ends Mar the surcharge should end because the law AB no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should not be charged for them In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value if the courts interpret the law differently than Enron then there should be no generation surcharge for DA customers This is the same argument we should make in our brief

be in effect In starts on January th but it is unclear as to when it would end Second and most important is what is meant by the Generation rate component While there is not much explanation in the

Enron provide witnesses without drawing more negatives Would a partner tow the Enron line Forwarded by Scott StonessHOUEES on PM Scott Stoness PM To Tamara ES cc harry kingerski Subject Draft Testimony re PGESCE for Discussion Summary The CPUC should implement two part RTPTOU rates for PGESCE A two part rate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of normal load and pay market value for consumption incremental or decremental to normal load The CPUC should define normal consumption as consumption over and above of historical consumption The CPUC should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by DWR for spot purchases in that hour In the event that implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is complicated to design the MWh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is possible The current draft design of the CPUC is discriminatory to large customers The current draft design of the CPUC does not provide appropriate price signals The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are unneccessarly high The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are far in excess of those which the CPUC intended The current draft design of the CPUC results is static and does not respond to changing market conditions Design Goals The CPUC should design rates that Give appropriate price signals to customers to consume conserve energy as as close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible Treat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner Achieve targeted revenue requirements Are easy to administer and understand Summary of CPUC Illustrative Design The CPUC has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to marginal rates Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in Summer Weekdays from noon to PM Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in all other hours Critique based on Design Goals Draft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short The rates for power Mar based on DJNP on peak is MWh The rates for power Mar based on DJNP off peak is MWh The proposed marginal rates for E Secondary is MWh for on peak and off peak This rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in lower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods Draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis E Transmission Voltage customers will experience a rate increase E Secondary voltage customers will experience a rate increase A Medium General Service customers will experience a rate increase A Small LP customers will experience a rate increase The marginal price signal for A will be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the on peak summer The marginal price signal for E wills be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the off peak periods PGE has a longer summer period than SCE This results in a increase for SCE TOUSub as compared to increases for PGE E Transmission rate The proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for SCE customers than PGE customers For example the on peak rate for SCE TOUSub is MWh as compared to PGE E Transmission rate of MWh Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue Draft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge increase does not ocur until May for PGE and June for SCE it should be possible to implement Enron Proposed Rates Enron proposes Two part real time pricing time of use rate Usage up to of historical use would be billed at historical rates Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak where customers has real time metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has time of use metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at of DJNP On Peak and of DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has just energy metering Critique based on Design Goals Enron proposals charge all customer at very close to marginal rates Thus within the constraints of using Dow Jones the rates should be very close to the actual marginal rates The rates will not be exact because they are Determined on the previous day Ony differentiate between on and off peak as compared to hour by hour To the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability the rates will be determined on a class average basis However the rates be far superior to the CPUC draft design because They give better price signals to night consumption They give better signals to weekend consumption They give better signals to winter consumption They are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of marginal costs For example if summer costs are lower the rate will be lower The Enron proposal will motivate DSM activities in winter summer and off peak Enron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of utility and rate class The Enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial as with residential ABX provides that residential customers that consume energy below normal rates will not have increased rates This design also achieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue but even more importantly it ensures tracking of costs Setting the normal load at of historical load results in a MWh increase if the market value for the entire year is MWh In the event that the market value for the entire year is less than MWh the resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue The Enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can easily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price signals and revenue targets The revenue outcome is less certain than the CPUC draft design however the impact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up when the costs go up Draft proposal require greater implementation details than the CPUC design but such extra costs are worthwhile The Enron proposal requires Determination of historical loads for large customers Determination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers Determination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers Determination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new customer Then Enron proposal has the following negatives Some customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better off even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new price signals The rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different for each customer The rates may take more work to put in place for the utility The rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates depending upon the historical consumption of the customers Q In the event that it is not possible to implement the Enron rates by June what would you propose a an interim solution A The CPUC draft rates are so flawed that it would be superior to just implement a flat MWh surcharge to all customers This approach would be fairer and simpler Q Who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers A The DWR will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in rates of the utilities The are indifferent to buy more generation or selling less energy to customers Thus the DWR should be willing to pay for decremental consumption In the event that the DWR is not agreeable to paying for decremental consumption the utility should be allowed to borrow such funds and have the costs amortized for the next years In the event that the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption the normal load could be defined of historical and the CPUC could eliminate credits resulting from decremental consumption Such solution would discourage conservation below but would not be expected to diminish the effectiveness of the Enron proposed rates Q Why is DJNP the right index to choose A DJNP and DJSP are availble for each weekday for on and off peak pricing The index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day for today The DJ index is compiled based on the information provided by many of the large trading companies including Enron The numbers provided by the participants are subject to audit Thus DJ is the best avaible information available for energy pricing Q What index is suitable for weekends A Enron proposes that the average DJNP off peak energy

RegionThe Bentley xchange Dirk vanUldenWestern RegionThe Bentley xchange Steve ES Jennifer ES cc Subject Quick Update On the various matters currently before the California PUC The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between DWRs cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect The order only applies however to the power purchased under the Governors emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether but if the Commission didnt want to vacate the order it would need to change the decision so that the IOUs dont eat any shortfalls The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses In addition it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week So the opportunity to act and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it With respect to the cost of utility generation ie retained generating assets and QF contracts the Commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a Commission decision adopting an interim procurement charge on March th There is another workshop scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities proposals after which the utilities will be required to file formal advice letters with the Commission Those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the th Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that DWR incurs to buy power Everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for DWRs costs and the Commission will if necessary raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole Unfortunately the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops And until there is clarity on whether the Commission will agree to pass through those costs Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWRs credit as it applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays ie the utilities financial position TURNs proposal to net out the utilitities generationrelated revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap the date on which the rate has or will end etc Recently TURN modified its testimony in response to the passage of ABX TURNs new position is that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February st the effective date of ABX EES will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to TURNs latest stance on the end of the rate freeze We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities stranded generating assets That compensation could come in one of two forms access to a proportionate share of the utilities retained costbased generating assets or a credit representing the difference between the market value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets We are not getting much traction thus far The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue the issue of whether to net out generatingrelated revenues against the undercollection etc on March So both sets of issues the procurement charges and the end of the rate freeze are scheduled to be finalized on March albeit in separate orders With respect to the Block Foward issue our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers However it has become clear that despite those efforts FERCs decision on charge backs will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward issue Best Jeff

following enhancements We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process ie Keep rate freez e in effect until the Mar Make state agency take over as ESP to all bundled customers at of frozen rate This solution keeps the current Rate Freeze in place and keeps us in the game to not lose our negative ctc It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal It also puts government agency in the same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us I t also accomodates the problem of RFPs taking longer than expected It also solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for forbearance And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy which minimizes their negotiating power I dont understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin g assets of PGE The worry I have is that PGE gets to keep of the benefits of nuclear sales and of the benefits of hydro sales post rate freeze If we damage the utilities are now in the drivers seat re ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average generation rate from to serve any competitive load in California This suggest a replacement to AB which suggests significa nt changes Would it not be better to say After the rate freeze the government entity would take over the obligations of PGE and continue them to the end of Such assumption and continuation would be combined wi th the government entity recieving the benefits of the difference between market prices and embedded costs of the SCEPGE existing generation assets Summary of Solution that incorporates these suggestions Government entity becomes an ESP taking over all customers not served by another ESP Government accepts any ESPs that come back within weeks Utilities stopped from selling any additional nuclear hydro

California Edison Applauds Court Findings in Lawsuit Against CPUC Southern California Edison Company SCE today released the following statement in response to todays expedited decision by the US District Court upholding the utilitys right to recover the costs of purchasing power for its customers ROSEMEAD Calif Jan SCE applauded todays decision by US District Court Judge Ronald SW Lew upholding the central claim of our lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission CPUCour right to recover the reasonable costs of purchasing power for our customers This ruling is an important step toward rebuilding the financial stability of Californias electric power system The court found that a trial is needed on the question of whether SCEs purchases were prudent We believe we will prevail on that issue too because the CPUC has repeatedly held that purchases made through Californias Power Exchange and Independent System Operator are by definition reasonable We will work with the CPUC to implement a schedule for the reasonable recovery of our costs We filed the lawsuit on Nov asking the federal court to overturn rulings by the CPUC that illegally prevent it from the reasonable recovery of operating costs for purchasing power it has been forced to incur on behalf of our customers We believe that the five members of the commission violated federal law when after requiring us to procure wholesale power for its customers from the states newly deregulated wholesale market and to sell it without markup the commission blocked us from recovering the full cost of doing so Our lawsuit was made necessary by the commissions refusal over the past eight months to heed warnings that its policies breach federal law and unfairly place the company and our customers in jeopardy In the lawsuit we noted that we incurred undercollections the difference between outofcontrol wholesale power costs and frozen retail rates approaching billion that have seriously weakened our financial integrity and service reliability This suit is one of many steps we are taking to attempt to remedy serious market problems that threaten the ability of the states major utilities to continue serving their customers We are pursuing every possible means of protecting our customers and shareholders from Californias dysfunctional electricity market An Edison International company Southern California Edison is one of the nations largest electric utilities serving a population of more than million via million customer accounts in a squaremile service area within central coastal and Southern California

Attached are the proposed answers Comments to Davis regarding some Speculated Solutions State could build generation The real issue is not who builds but that generation gets built in California Any generation that is built in California will reduce problems because it will displace load Displace load will cause lower demand which in turn wi ll result in lower market prices new supplydemand balance Our proposal RFP of MW will allow all kinds of proposals including ownership by government to explore It is okay for the government to build generation but it should not result in any different outcome than anyone else building Output of existing generation at cost Output of existing utility generation should be sold at cost Utilities that caused the mess should not benefit All customers including those being served by other suppliers paid for these utilities when they were below market They should get their share o f benefits of the existing assets now at cost Municipal utilities could be required to sell their excess generation in California The problem we are incurring are related to government intervention ie price caps and illiquidity causing uncertainty that causes California utilities to desire to sell outside of the state Removal of price caps will keep municipal generation in the state There is no need to mandate that it stay within California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation This solution is a great idea which is included in our pitch As indicated we are advocating a CPUC process of RFPs that would inclu de universities This is a superior method because universities are slow to act and we need solution by summer Expand instate gas production No comment on this specific solution However Enron notes that the QF s have rate that are linked to gas The Government should explore requiring the QFs to buy gas forward and sell at costs for to years to lock in low costs The real issue related to gas is increasing gas capacity Any increase in gas production in California or new pipeline into California would do much to reduce electricity costs Governor Davis should ask the the California Energy Commission to explore ways to increase gas supplies in much the same manner suggested previously for electricity Take state lands gas royalties in kind No comment aside from above Negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for additional gas supplies No comment aside from above Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time This solution should not be necessary if no entity holds too much market power and entities are exposed to market price They will seek to maintain their assets such that they are available in high cost times Generators that are paid on a fixed price basis are at risk to doing bad maintenance timing Thus a committee to review maintenance timing of QFs utility owned generation would be appropriate Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer termin state The governor should not cause generation builders more risk Whats important is that generation be built in California nothing else Any extra risk will cause less generation to be built Emission trading should be made right for all generation built in Californi a Condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state Whats important is that generation be built in California nothing else Any extra risk will cause less generation to be built Securitize uncollected power purchase costs This is a great idea if made available to all customers We are suggesting that hedging be done through entities bidding on standard offer using the benefits of existing utility generation and securitization Utilities are not good at hedging so those that are good should bid on default supplier status Allowing securitization of
