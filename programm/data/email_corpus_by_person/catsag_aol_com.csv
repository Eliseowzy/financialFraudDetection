quotedprintable by mailmanenroncom id SAA ATTENTION This is a lengthy email Avoid eyestrain Print it before you continue Dear Liz I wish Id been at the house when you called the other Friday Robert and I were scrambling about attending to a dozen last minute errands on our last full day stateside Just that morning he had interviewed at Flint Hill School a K private school in Oakton and came back beaming He hit it off with everyone he spoke with and they let him know they would offer him the job Director of Technology as soon as they checked his references The Headmaster called the following Weds night with an offer and said hed have the contract in the mail the next day Of course he assumed Robert would want to discuss it with his wife as of February thats me before accepting Thursday night two weeks ago Robert called him back to deliver a resounding I accept Hes very excited about the job a truly promising and stimulating change from strictly teaching The schools policy is that all administrators must teach a class so hell be keeping one foot in the classroom We were SO very relieved that the salary offered was more than we expected and we believe well be able to live comfortably Very good news considering that therell be no second income any time soon for this future NoVa household Unless I sell a screenplay or start a homebased business down the line Avon calling Tupperware Parties Mary Kay Amway medical billing stuffing envelopes The Hamptons will after all be back in the Land of Opportunity His job starts late July and well stay with my parents until we can find a good place to live Id like to live as close to the school as possible so hell be spared the hardships of commuting The Vienna Metro the last stop on that line isnt far from the school so we could also consider living near other stops back down the line where he could ideally walk to the station and ride from there That area out there is unknown territory in my experience Vienna is as far as I ever got while growing up in Langley Im hankering to make a home these days so Im excited at the prospect of hunting for one And of course Ill have Moms seasoned advice and assistance I even have a few boxes of housewares still in storage at my parents from when Philip and I lived on th Street in New York They havent seen the light of day in almost years I have no idea what Ill find when I open them up Robert has acquired very little mostly books and CDs living solo for so long This is fortunate because shipping belongings to the States from here is bound to be a complicated chore and expensive as well As much as Robert has enjoyed life here in Roma since arriving in the fall of to work at the American Overseas School of Rome where he has been teaching ever since we didnt seriously consider remaining here Job opportunities are very limited for someone who is not a citizen of the EU In that respect its rather a dead end For me the charms and pleasures of city living in general are few and farbetween at this time in my life And I find the urban living conditions here even harder to cope with than in the US The noise and air pollution are greater and the traffic seems far worse and more chaotic inadequate roads more automobiles and hordes of infernal spewing deafening motorbikes that dont observe even the most basic of traffic laws and make every trip an obstacle course But my greatest pet peeve The clouds of cigarette smoke everywhere you go It really is nauseating and spoils the pleasure of eating out or going to a cafe or coffee bar We flew back to Rome Saturday March having spent weeks with my parents on Hampton Ridge Drive in The Hamptons how fitting Robert Hampton was entitled to weeks matrimonial leave Italian Law and the third week was the schools midwinter vacation My doctor had no objections to my flying in my th month so I wasnt uneasy about it Our flight to DC via Newark was a breeze because we were on a lessthanfull the biggest most spacious and most comfortable plane Ive ever experienced Our return flight was another story entirely a DC cramped stuffy packed with passengers many were bibletoting pilgrims to the Eternal City dreadfully dry air it was miserable It took me almost a full week to recover from that night and the jet lag Of course at this stage in my pregnancy Im experiencing the occasional acute discomfort but for the most part its been a troublefree months What a unique sensation it is feeling the baby bumping around in the womb I cant help but laugh much of the time its such a curious sensation and sight Shes been very active all along at all times of the day and evening Im glad to say most nights I sleep quite soundly Baby is due April th two weeks from Thursday and the schools spring vacation is April th May so Daddys Home Mom will be coming over as soon as her nd granddaughter is this side of the womb We returned to find Spring has arrived here with lots of birdsong and flowering all around cherry and almond blossoms mimosa a new sight and scent for me daffodils daisies and violets I must say Im glad our daughter will be arriving at this balmy time of year We are still undecided about a name for her but we agree wed like it to be Italian in honor of her birthplace Were told she may even be entitled to Italian citizenship But as with all things regarding Italian law and its interpretation and realworld application one never knows until one dares to enter the byzantine and infernal world of Italian bureaucracy We went to the Italian Embassy in DC with our marriage certificate in order to get a proper visa for me tourists are only permitted to stay in the country months at a time only to learn that the only one that I could apply for is impossible under the circumstances Because Robert has been residing in the country he is required to request from the authorities here that his spouse join him Then once his request is granted he must send the appropriate paperwork to me in the US where I in turn approach the Embassy for the visa And we learned the other day that the waiting period here just for an appointment to make the initial request is months Theres a possibility that because Im pregnant and have already joined him here I can get some kind of residence permit We wanted me to be here legally so there would be no snags when it comes time to register the babys birth Its all rather exasperating Even the American Embassy needs to see my divorce certificates in order for us to register her birth with them I had to go rummaging in my parents basement to find them and it will be the first time Ive had reason to present them to anyone The last months have been eventful to say the least Our romance started in Waterford where I was housesitting for the summer the first weekend in July and it started with a conscious expressed and mutual desire to have and raise a child together Weve known each other since living in Charlottesville in and curiously enough he met both Philip in New York in and Tom when he and I spent a few days here in Rome in November of just a couple of months after we got married Also wed spent time together over the past couple of summers on Block Island and Id visited him here back in January of But not until this past summer were we both truly unattached and free to get involved We feel it was a beautiful twist of fate that I got pregnant right away The fact is Id read for years that it can take much time and effort for a woman my age I turned in October to conceive We feel such joy and promise being together and are looking forward to joining the rest of you in the secret society known as Parenthood Robert is the most wonderful and sweetest man Ive ever been with He is so goodnatured and eventempered and bright Life with him just gets better and better I do hope our daughter has his disposition So you can see why we felt it was fitting that we get married in Waterford We arrived in Virginia on Sunday the th and made our way to the Loudon County Courthouse in Leesburg on the afternoon of the th to get the license One doesnt need to be a resident of Virginia and there is no waiting period since the state doesnt require blood tests Caroline had already made inquiries about the civil ceremony They arent performed at the Court House but the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court provides the names and numbers of local civil marriage celebrants We called around Monday and found that Mr Fred Howard was willing to come to Waterford the morning of the th The woman who completed the license for us asked us who would be officiating We answered and she exclaimed Well hes right behind you We turned around where we stood at the counter and saw a portrait on the wall identified as Fred Howard Clerk of the Circuit Court It turns out both he and his wife are natives of Leesburg He was a delightful and gracious man and we were so pleased with the ceremony The fact is wed given almost no thought to the event itself Caroline made it truly memorable by making a cake and a bridal bouquet buying champagne dressing us that very morning and taking photographs Id bought a loosefitting size deep blue velvet floorlength sleeveless shift on Monday at Marshalls for a haphazard purchase I made on the fly while shopping for an interview outfit for Robert Id also bought some special tea from Paris at Sutton Place Gourmet across from my parents and packed of Grandmothers best teacups thinking we could have a tea ceremony of sorts to mark the occasion Out of the blue the result of Carolines prompting Robert appeared in one of Charlies suits It sent me into a panic my casual black wool turtleneck under my dress wouldnt do now Caroline came up with a long and flowing ivory silk blouse and a string of pearls that complemented my dress perfectly And so the wedding party Caroline Charlie Walker Robert Michael Hampton and Jacqueline Walker Brock took their places in the cabin before Mr Howard who shortly thereafter pronounced us husband and wife No matter that there were no rings to exchange Ill be looking for one here in Rome Robert has never worn a ring and is reluctant to do so Perhaps a tattoo is in order And then we were able to go outside for a photo session because the weather that day was so balmy Two days later snow and sleet arrived but for the rest of our visit the weather was very agreeable and temperatures were warm and springlike most every day I would love to hear from you Ive been meaning to get in touch for months Hows YK treating the Cox family of Houston How did you celebrate the New YearNew Millennium I understand that youll be going to Tinas wedding with Ella and that Alex and Lucy and Kate and Chi will be there as well That should be both a memorable reunion and curious event Boy was it shocking to learn that Mrs Pafenburg died and that Mr Pafenburg is now living with Tina and suffering from Alzheimers and requiring a fulltime attendant to look after him It truly makes me appreciate the good health and life that my parents have Email me when you can Hope all is well with you Love to you and Grant Ella
