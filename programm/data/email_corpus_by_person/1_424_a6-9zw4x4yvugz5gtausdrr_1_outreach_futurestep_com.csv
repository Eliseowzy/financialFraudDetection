Government remains strong Some highlights Education In light of the current economic situation many recent college graduates are opting to go back to graduate school rather than face the job market In addition many professionals some left jobless after the technology fall out are reassessing their priorities and going back to school to pursue interests that had been put on hold during the getrichquick lates Both groups are banking on an economic turnaround by graduation time In the meantime their renewed interest in school means continued opportunities in the Education marketplace Government Due to the Bush administrations policies and the war on terrorism there has been an increase in defense and security funding and the job market in both sectors should remain strong in the coming months Association NonProfit There has been such an outpouring of donations for victims of the terrorist attacks that many associations and nonprofits have redoubled their fundraising efforts to compete Afraid to come off as insensitive or unpatriotic many organizations encourage donations to the various September funds while asking for continued support to their funds To compound the situation the investment portfolios of many organizations have taken a pounding because of the decline in equity markets NEWS VIEWS Thinking About an MBA Going back to school The thought conjures up serene campuses summer vacations and a laidback lifestyle After several years of hour workweeks heading back to class might sound like a muchneeded twoyear break And hey MBA grads can command sixfigure salaries But are you really ready to exchange your salary and briefcase for a backpack and student loans Heres what to consider when thinking about going back to school
