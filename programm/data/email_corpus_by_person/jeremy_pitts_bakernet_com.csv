weather derivatives which we discussed last week This advice is based on discussions with Naoaki Eguchi and Shinji Toyohara We have tried to provide a practical response to all of the issues raised If you need further discussion on the theoretical underpinnings please let me know As background the main advice to date on this issue has been our initial advice of January a memorandum to John Viverito dated July and an email to John Viverito dated July Question CanShould ToaRe and Enron Japan give a mutual representation to the effect that they are each entering into the transaction to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary course of their business If not can the representation be deleted or amended ToaRe has taken the position that it is a risk taker in this transaction and that accordingly it cannot give the representation because it is not hedging risk Similarly Enron Japan does currently have weather exposure in Japan and accordingly cannot be said to be hedging weather risk It follows that the representation as currently drafted does not fit the actual circumstances of either party and needs to be modified or deleted Our recommendation would be to modify the representation as follows a each party represents to the other that it understands the transaction it is entering into the transaction in the ordinary course of its business and that it has a legitimate business purpose for entering into the transaction b ToaRe represents to Enron Japan that it has the power and authority to enter into the transaction under the Insurance Business Law The modification to paragraph a removes the word hedge which would have been problematic to both parties but retains the basic concept that this is a commercial transaction within the ordinary scope of business of both parties We understand that Enron Japans business purposes allow Enron Japan to engage in weather derivative transaction We also note that the Financial Law Board Paper on Derivatives Transactions and Gambling issued on November the Financial Law Board is an unofficial organisation of legal practitioners has stated that a company that enters into derivative transactions as a business may be able to argue that it has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions particularly where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions are conducted within reasonable parameters Based on these factors we believe that Enron Japan should be able to give both representations However Enron Japan should note that the issue is not entirely clear under Japanese law and there remains a remote possibility that a Japanese court might determine that Enron Japan did not have a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transaction The representation in paragraph b is based on the provisions of the Insurance Business Law that enable insurance companies including Japanese reinsurance companies to enter into certain types of derivative transactions We understand that the FSA has provided informal guidance to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide enough to also allow financial institutions to enter into weather derivatives However this is a matter that ToaRe would need to confirm with the FSA directly and we are not able to express a general view all that is possible is for Enron Japan to request the representation from Toa Re Please note that in cases where Enron Japans counterparty is a manufacturing company the representation as originally drafted should be given by the counterparty Question Exposure for Enron Japan As discussed in our earlier advice the issue of whether weather derivatives constitute gambling under the Japanese Criminal Code is not clear and we are not able to provide a definite opinion on these issues There are two defenses to an allegation of gambling under the Criminal Code acts in accordance with law and legitimate business purpose In principle each counterparty must be able to show that one of the defenses applies to it There is at least a suggestion in the Financial Law Board paper that if the act in accordance with law defense applies to one party the counterparty should also be able to rely on this defense However this argument does not have judicial support and the more conservative position is to ensure that each party meets one or more of the defenses In this case looking at each defense in turn a ToaRe is a reinsurance company and will be entitled to rely on the provisions of the Insurance Business Law to argue that entering into a weather derivative transaction is an act in accordance with law and thus does not constitute gambling and b it is arguable that consistent with the comments of the Financial Law Board discussed above both ToaRe and Enron Japan have a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transaction on the basis that each party is carrying on a business of trading weather risk each party is a sophisticated investor as Enron Japan is a new company it would need to rely on the experience of Enron Japan traders previously located offshore to show sophistication and each party at least in the case of Enron Japan is conducting the transaction in accordance with reasonable parameters Accordingly assuming that ToaRe is able to give the representations referred to above and that these representations are correct both paragraph a and paragraph b appear to apply Thus we do not believe that the risk for Enron Japan in entering into this transactions with ToaRe will be any higher than would have been the case if Enron Japan had entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user for example an air conditioning company We have previously characterised this risk as being relatively low It is conceivable that Enron Japan may in the future enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial institutions nor end users for example other traders like Enron itself would fall into this category In such a case Enron Japan will not be able to rely on the act in accordance with law argument and will be obliged to rely only on the legitimate business purpose argument based on the fact that the counterparty is a trader of financial products In our view the risk for Enron Japan in this scenario would increase but could still be characterised as being relatively low In this situation Enron Japan and the counterparty would give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in paragraph a under Question above Question Criminal Sanctions From a technical point of view criminal sanctions apply only to individuals and not to companies In this case the criminal sanctions if any for gambling could potentially apply to the trader that entered into the transaction The responsible managers may also have criminal liability on the basis that they controlled the acts of the trader or solicited the acts of the trader The penalties are Simple gambling up to Yen fine Habitual gambling imprisonment up to years Booking imprisonment of between months and years Question Conducting the transactions using an Enron affiliate located outside Japan As noted in section of our July memorandum we consider that the risk that the activity constituted gambling would be reduced if Enron were to enter into weather transactions from offshore Embedded in the foregoing comments is the concept that the representations in the GTCs need to vary depending on whether the counterparty is a financial institution another unregulated trader or an end user of weather derivatives The representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the counterparty would be an end user If appropriate we would be happy to provide alternate forms of representations for your reference Please let

WeatherHDDFloorOTCToaRejmbdoc Dear Jeremy Pls see for your information my email to Alan Mark and Alan As discussed your answers to my questions can be quite brief and pls cross reference previous advice rather than repeating it I think the answer to question whether we can give the warranty has got to be no So short and sweet on this is fine Re whether we can go ahead without the same cii from them but with ciii is a harder question and I understand that all you can do is explain our risk and exposure in light of the current factual situation This is a risk appetite question at the end of

Urgent Weather Derivative Advice Document link Jane McBride Dear Alan and Mark I am going to need you to help me make a risk decision I welcome input from Mark Evans but he may be more comfortable leaving this up to Alan and Mark because Alan and Mark have been involved in this gambling issue from the beginning Jeremy Pitts and I have had a brief conversation re my email to him below this afternoon but he will not be able to get written comments signed off by Japanese lawyers to me until Monday The situation relates to the Tokyos offices first weather derivatives deal which is with a company called Toa Reinsurance In a nutshell the situation is that negotiations have come to a standstill because neither side can move on their positions re the gambling warranties The deal of course though has already been done over the telephone several weeks ago In a nutshell then based on discussions with Jeremy Pitts but to be clarified by Japanese lawyer on Monday the situation is In terms of Enron Japans ability to trade weather derivatives here we are operating in the grey even if we can get warranty cii from them ToaRe will not give us the important warranty cii below because they say they cant They say they are not actually entering into the deal to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary course of their business which is what the subject warranty says BM have advised that the obtaining of this warranty from a counter party helps keep us in the grey and out of the red in terms of what we are doing and also gives us comfort that the counter party can do the deal ToaRe is in addition separately asking us to give them the same warranty Jane McBride analysis Re Given that our legal situation is grey at best I do not think we should be giving the warranty they have requested They say they will not give us that warranty The issue then is whether we can go ahead without getting the warranty from them bearing in mind that a binding telephone deal has been done If you agree with me that we cant give the warranty then we have to decide whether we can go ahead without getting the warranty referred to in above from them I am not sure however that in practice we even have a choice given that the trade has been done If we go ahead without giving and without getting the warranty the risk to us is that we are more likely to be in breach of the prohibition on gambling in the Criminal Law Are we willing to take this risk and who needs to give me this answer Jane Jane McBride To Jeremy AKERNETcom cc PaulTYO akerNetcom Alan CT John PM nron Mark CT Jonathan nron Mark CT Subject Urgent Weather Derivative Advice Document link Jane McBride See attached file WeatherHDDFloorOTCToaRejmbdoc Dear Jeremy I would like to refine the following instructions There are two only issues on which we need specific written advice and they both relate to Warranty cii of the draft which says XYZ is entering into a weather derivative transaction to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary course of its business a Can Enron Japan give the warranty at this stage in its growth Have we already had any written advice from you on whether Enron Japan can warrant along these lines If so when If not the facts seem to be that Enron Japan plans to trade commodities which are energy related but because we are still building up the business we are not trading these products yet As you know we are getting into the power market If we have done a weather derivative then we can of course offer better prices on the electricity deals we are negotiating Other Enron companies are of course already trading many weather dependant commodities and power It could be argued therefore that unless we can rely on the weather related risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative transacting in these early days that this is a speculative transaction constituting gambling depending on how the law on this works It is understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effect that we are not gambling because we are asking them to do so I know we have had sign off from BM re our weather derivative trading but I wonder if anyone considered what the situation would be before we ourselves had other transactions giving us weather related risks b If not how could it be amended so that we can give it c If still relevant in the context of your answers to a and b above they did offer previously to take out all warranties so that neither party gives any warranties The deal cannot be cancelled because it was done on the telephone late Sept Accordingly what is the practical risk of us proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe including the warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law ie an insurance company They are insisting they not give ii and that we be satisfied with iii only for the purposes of the Gambling Law Pls confirm in writing whether you think we can
