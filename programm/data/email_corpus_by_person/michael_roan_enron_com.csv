<19362712.1075861632712.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.roan@enron.com,2001-11-12 13:13:56,RE AllianceJust been through the paper and have the following thoughts or concerns dep ending on your viewpoint The model is inconsistent with the approach taken by FERC NG propose that every transco sets its own rates runs its own OASIS and manages cong estionhow can this ensure seamless practices within each RTO footprin t I suggest the opposite will occur that is balkanization For example Transcos can join MISO under Appendix I and a number are proposing to do so Based on NGs proposed split of functions each transco could join MI SO with its own tx rates OASIS platform and congestion protocol regardless of whether they are consistent Under this scenario transmission rates an d markets would remain balkanized and vary depending on transmission compan y geographic reach similar to today NG state that the benefit of a for profit entity is that it can and w ill manage risk commercially i agree However NG miss the point hereI f an RTOISO is a non profit organisation it will only provide services su ch as tariff admin OASIS and congestion management such an RTO will not own tx assetsthe tx companies that it provides services on behalf of w ill continue to do so In providing these services the RTOISO only mana ges risk associated with non provision of service not the underlying trans mission delivery risk The transmission companies for whom the RTO provid es services will continue to be for profit entities and will continue to manage risks commercially RTO benefits result primarily from aggregation of services not from more appropriate commercial risk managementthere is nothing to stop tx owners from managing risk more effectively regardless of proposed RTO structure For example NG as a transco Translink or Cine rgy transmission could propose liquidated damage clauses for overselling fi rm transmission under the non profit RTO structure Likewise NG as transco and RTO could make the same proposal Commercial form is a second order issue NG should have concentrated on supporting FERC policy RTOs rather than stating one parties view on separation of RTO functions between profit non profit entities FERC policy suggests that the key structural issues are increasing market size regional markets and third party access l evel playing field This was the basis for the CGM proposal that came ou t of the SE mediation Separating CM and OATT admin from planning and sec urity coord improves third party access to real time information which in turn will facilitate market based investment decision making being investm ent in transmission generation or DSM Suggesting that transmission inve stment is necessary to resolve existing transmission constraints either sho ws ignorance or more likely the conflict that NG hasi suggest that inves tment in generation or DSM could resolve the problems just as adequately The model seems to be based on the assumption that transmission charges will continue to be based on contract path congestion managed through r edispatch I assume that NG and other transmission companies prefer thi s approach as it allows them to both maximise cash returns above appropria te regulated rates and control information that facilitates new investment retain monopoly I agree with Jim that this suggests a physical approac h to congestion management NGs concept that third parties can energy ma rkets is consistent with the ARTO approach ie allowing an APX to provid e day ahead market functions for example I would propose that a transco should not care what tx charging methodology was in place as long as it i s perceived to be reasonable by customers and receives its aggregate regula ted revenue requirement Thus CM and OATT administration are not core tran sco functions at all In summary I suggest that NG actually propose the paper to reflect a for profit RTO but they do not state this anywhere even if true they do not state anywhere that a transco should have consistent OATT and CM protocols if the assets they own are non contiguous or the transco has a number of owners I agree with Luiz that in this form it is a hard sell and does not resolve Enrons ongoing concerns regards Mike Original Message From Maurer Luiz SentTuesday November AM ToSteffes James D SubjectRE Alliance Jim As per your request I examined the attached doc Response of National Grid US to Questions posed by the Com File National Grid Transco White Pap erdoc m ission My initial reaction is The simple answer to your question is yes I think the proposed governa nce and organization structure can live with an LMP model I am not familia r with other MISO CM model but at least in terms of LMP my feeling is tha t those are not mutually exclusive It may be worth asking Ashley Brown National Grid and other proponents of ForProfitTranscos may have other ideas on how to manage congestions eg different reliability level produ cts by customer segment However the attached paper makes no allusion to avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models The paper do es not imply a physical model either Your feeling may be right but it doe s not surface from the paper per se National Grid proposal is in fact an expanded version of the Southeast Model proposed at the Mediation It reinforces the role of the Transco Com pany preempting to some extent the role of the System Admininstrator Th is was a very controversial topic in the mediation the System Adminstrator was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias particularly fr om transmission companies who are not willingable to transfer their T asse ts National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea Your concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are surfaced in the paper by creating a concept of core vs additional fun ctions and a chinese wall if necessary But the perception of potential b ias does exist National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in s elling this idea Particularly when we get to the details LM Original Message From Steffes James D SentMonday November PM ToMaurer

managing the key fears generation redisp atch and longterm transmission plant over generation investments As I read this document I get the strange feeling that NG is a physicalri ght player Meaning NG needs to build a model based on physical flows so they can control a TTCATC and b use of nonfirm transmission While the NG letter states that the functions related to energy markets ca n be performed by a disinterested thirdparty NG specifically reserves as a Core Function the Ability to propose congestion pricing methodology Sure APX could go in and operate the balancing and CM system
