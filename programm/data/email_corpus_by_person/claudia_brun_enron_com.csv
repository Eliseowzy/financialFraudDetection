to Champion Ive made a few changes to the attachment of the Champion draft contract that I would like you to take a look at sorry Brent but they are in Portuguese in the interest of getting this deal done ASAP The basics are as follows If Champion has a Load Factor above They pay a final price that could be a max of R MWh or a min of R MWh The final price will be determined based on an indexation formula that will dictate the exact fluctuation DArcy I think we should have a more final formula to include so please review it If Champion has a Load Factor equal or below They pay a demand charge of R kW assuming the contracted demand is kW and R MWh that they consume To be honest this doesnt give us any real protection on the demand charge side but its consistent with a previous agreement with Elektro Ideally I would like to see Champion committ to a min take or pay of say of the energy We need further confirmation on these numbers from Luiz Otvio and Baccaro the idea was to use the same numbers of the Elektro contract but assuming the increase that you got The idea is to make this contract a little simpler than what DArcy had in mind initially in the interest of getting the deal done by the end of this month we need verbal confirmation tomorrow though to inform volumes to the MAE Please send your comments asap Claudia DArcy Carroll PM To Brent HendryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc

Subject Re Champion legal I am still somewhat unclear on the indexing structure but I will specify what I see the deal as and you can correct me if I get it wrong When the deal was described to me it sounded like we were buying a floor and that we would imbed the floor into the physical power deal After looking at the structure you sent it looks like they are the ones buying the floor They are getting paid by virtue of the reduced cost of energy if the spot goes below the strike now im confused Champion will benefit from a fall in paper prices through a reduction in the cost of their energy limited to a minimum of R with an original and maximum price of R defer to you for advice on how to best structure this ie theoretically both Champion and Enron SA are buying puts floor Champion from ECE and ECE from Enron NA but yes absolutely no question ECE would prefer to imbed the product in its energy sale so that Champion only sees floating price with possible adjustments to the downside Based on your email this is how I think the deal would be structured We supply on a firm basis MW of energy for three months They pay a floating price for the energy based on the following formula R minus an amount if positive equal to factor multiplied by the difference between a strike price in R and the Spot Price The Spot Price will be in R per pound of a paper product quoted in R which is to be defined I did not understand your third bullet point very well The relationship between the two indexes was unclear and contrary to your formula it did not appear that these indexes were quoted in R Please clarify these issues for me Formula R Avg decrease Index price Spot or Floor PriceSpot or Floor Price Page of proposal Tarifa eg adjusted each month on the decrease in the monthly index average Note would like prefer to set the Spot or Benchmark Price at outset The R versus PoundsMetric Ton issues are very good points defer to you I think BrentAndrea for preferred structure in this case Champion will I think defer to us We can ask how they execute for their exports and RPounds exposure We will need to know where and when to pick up the spot price so that everyone understands what published price will be used each month when the price is determined The factor will be something you will need to come up with to correlate the volumes you are hedging with the amount of electricity actually sold We will also need to make clear if there will be a floor on how low the price can go RMWh Do you intend for the price to be able to go below zero If so what do you intend to happen Based on your answers we will need to go to outside counsel to make sure we do not violate the Brazilian antigaming laws or any regulations I may have missed the point of how the trade is supposed to work so any additional information would be helpful before we go to outside counsel Thanks DArcy Carroll PM To Andrea Bertone Brent HendryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Claudia Brun Don Black Subject Champion legal Pls find overview listed re ECEChampionElektro transaction ECE selling equivalent of MW Peak and Offpeak energy eg consumption takeorpay for period Sep Oct Nov Price will be R which represents discount to present average Elektro rate of R ECE wants to adjust on a monthly basis the R sales price downward should the price of PPI UK A cut size g index or the PPI UK A Reels g index average below Strike Price x Pounds per Metric Ton The adjustment will be based on formula Avg Monthly hedged volume Index avgStrike Price RPound spot price We are trying to finalize negotiations this afternoon re both the energy sale and the incorporated index and strike etc and should feel like we have substantial flexibility to articulate how best to structure the transaction Pls shoot anyall inputs including needs for additional information
