rh Interesting article below about Calpine and others coupon convertible bonds with put options due April This is ugly RH Fortune November SECTION FEATURESTOXIC BONDS Pg LENGTH words HEADLINE Headed For A Fall Companies issued special zerocoupon bonds assuming theyd never have to pay them off Now shareholders could be on the hook for a billion tab BYLINE Janice Revell BODY It was an irresistible proposition Borrow billions of dollars pay no interest reap millions in tax breaks and then wait for the debt to simply disappear That was the promise of zerocoupon convertible bonds and companies from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money But of course there was a catch For this scenario to play out a companys stock price had to rise sharplyand quickly Thats because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equityif the stock tanked the bonds would no longer be worth converting So to make them more attractive to buyers companies had to build in an escape hatch If the stock price failed to rise sufficiently investors could put that is sell the bonds back to the companyin many cases after just one year And thats exactly whats about to happento the tune of some billion over the next three years Stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these special hybrids the prospect of conversion is now absurd It simply wont happen So bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can And because of the put feature that is possible Suddenly companies like Tyco Comcast and dozens more are on the hook for billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought theyd never have to pay That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies After all theyre the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders Companies without enough cashand the majority fall into this campare likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew That means sharply reduced earnings Especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratingsprime candidates for killer refinancing costs Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the debt creating significant shareholder dilution especially at current depressed prices To make matters worse this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking This is a ticking time bomb warns Margaret Patel manager of the Pioneer High Yield Bond fund a topperforming junk fund The seeds of this mess were sown in mid when the stock market started to falter Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling Zerocoupon convertible bonds presented an attractive alternative because companies didnt have to make cash interest payments on the bonds hence the name zero Instead issuers offered an upfront discountfor instance investors would buy a bond for and collect when it matured Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares But the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price rose significantlyin many cases by more than With that protective feature called the conversion premium zeros took off Corporate issuers would pay no interest and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels the debt would be swept away into equity If the bonds are converted its a home run for everybody says Jonathan Cohen vice president of convertiblebond analysis at Deutsche Bank That fourbagger of course depends entirely on the stock price rising If it doesnt the bondholders armed with that handy put feature can simply sell the bonds back to the company Great for bondholders but not so hot for the company or its shareholders But hey what are the odds of that happening CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go up says Cohen They dont worry about the bond getting put If all this seems a little complicated thats because it is A reallife example should help Californiabased electric utility Calpine issued billion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt At the time the companys stock was trading at about a shareseverely undervalued in the opinion of company management We really didnt want to sell equity at that point says Bob Kelly Calpines senior vice president of finance So the company instead opted to sell zeros setting the conversion premium at a hefty Still with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile the bonds werent exactly a screaming buy for investors So Calpine added the put feature Investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price eliminating any downside risk Things havent exactly worked out as management had hoped The stock has since plummeted to and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense So its looking as though Calpine will be liable for the billion in borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April Theres also the refinancing cost According to Kelly Calpines borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of an extra million per year in cash Obviously nobody plans for their stock to go down Kelly says I dont think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put Calpines potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is straddling junk If you are a borderline investmentgrade company a financing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world notes Anand Iyer head of global convertible research at Morgan Stanley The problem is there are a slew of companies with far worse credit ratings out there Jeff Seidel Credit Suisse First Bostons head of convertiblebond research estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category And others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the put date Today with junk yielding as much as percentage points above bonds rated investment grade refinancing can be a pricey proposition Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk It has million in zeros that it will probably have to buy back this January and another billion coming down the pike over the next couple of years Because of slowerthanexpected sales the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies And if Solectrons credit is downgraded the zeros would slide into junk status a situation that could cost the companyand its shareholderstens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges Refinancing isnt the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros Companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bondsup to of the amount raised If the debt is sold back many will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a oneyear loan Theyre getting bad advice claims one banker who didnt want to be named Look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into As if those potential consequences were not scary enough shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued Thats because some are bought by hedge funds which short the companys stock sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price at the same time that they buy the bonds If the stock goes down the shorts make money from their position If it goes up they profit by converting the bond to stock This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet at least for a while Grocery chain Supervalu for example recently lost of its market cap the day it announced it was issuing million in zeros Despite all the pitfalls the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continues thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide In fact the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing Even better thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code companies can rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than theyre actually paying All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail Verizon Communications for instance would pay annual interest on its billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls below of the issues conversion price In the eyes of the IRS oddly that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction for tax purposes of the same rate it pays on its regular debt Why Trust us you dont want to know That adds up to an annual deduction of more than million even if Verizon never shells out a dime in interest Not surprisingly more than half of the zeros issued in contain similar clauses Its an incredible deal for them says Vadim Iosilevich who runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management Not only are they raising cheap money theyre also doing tax arbitrage So despite the enormous risks to shareholders companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip According to ConvertBondcom seven new issues totaling billion have been sold since Oct alone I think the power of the tax advantage is going to keep them around says CSFBs Seidel Call it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quicklyit doesnt really matter Either way its the shareholders wholl be left paying the bill
