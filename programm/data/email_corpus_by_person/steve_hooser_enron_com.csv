an acceptable proposal If however Brian intends a private meeting between MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks

gas nominationstakes and that these nominations are not related to intramonth price volatility We discussed having an initial meeting next week Then if it makes sense I think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations These meetings would be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing nominations The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a solution to past sins and a way forward

either add the Reliant responses to our audit report as Auditee Responses or we can have Enron provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work The additional work is dependent on Enrons answers to the questions Please advise Rick To Frederick G Rhodes Richard J Feldmann cc Date PM From Matthew L Thomas Houston Subject Cooglers Response Rick and Fred I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City I have gone through all of Bruces numbers today I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs to answer Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers is Mcf day does Enron agree Reliant claims that the New Technology Contract overrides or is an exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception Reliant claims that all off the industrial misclassified gas in the Houston Division is under special contracts with special pricing and even though they are using less than Mcf day they receive a lower price of per MMBTU Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for heating in the winter about three months out of the year Is there total divided by three to find their average usage or is it divided by Bruce divided by three we divided by twelve They are a customer all year and are not a new customer or a customer that has left Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the Mcf rule What will the actual cut off be Bruce backs out Mcf that was close but not quite Mcf These are the issues that I see The first three questions are things that Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson We were not notified of any of the special contracts that he mentions Let me know what I need to do If you guys have questions
