Dave Kearns Ive been telling you for some time how good NetWare is Most major technical publications have also been telling you how good NetWare is Even the occasional story in the mass media has generally spoken well about NetWare when the writer has a vague understanding of networking technologies Whats been lacking though is recognition by third party vendors and other socalled after market suppliers that NetWare is an important player in enterprise networks I was surprised to see for example that almost six months after the release of NetWare there are still no books in print about the operating system not even from Novell Press Thats why its so gratifying to see a new release of a software package intended specifically for the NetWare platform Network Associates McAfee division has just released a new version of its flagship NetShield product for the new NetWare operating system NetShield for NetWare allows you to protect all of your NetWare servers from malicious attacks and viruses through a single console installation Moreover NetShield includes integration with McAfees ePolicy Orchestrator ePO which provides reporting and trend analysis as well as remote software deployment Also new in this release is support for Novell Cluster Services Thats important since each box of NetWare includes a license for a twoserver cluster You can view select and scan mounted cluster volumes with NetShield which also provides survival support whenever a cluster server is off line McAfees ePO works in conjunction with NetShield to extend the technologies used for antivirus protection to more generalized network management including policy management and software deployment NetShield will run on NetWare or higher although NetWare specific functions such as clustering support wont be available with earlier versions of the Novell operating system McAfee products have always been at the forefront of virus protection and at the forefront of NetWarebased applications for many years Now McAfee is at the forefront of NetWare specific applications McAfee deserves your support and you should at least take a look at its offering Correction In the last NetWare

Novell friendly firms Theyve now joined forces with Microsoft to launch a free seminar tour called NetWare and Windows Real World Options for Novell Customers The blurb aspabouteventaspmastercodeMSBSMI says Do you rely on Novell NetWare NetWare Directory Services andor GroupWise Are you are considering your organizations next strategic move Are you unsure if it includes integrating with or migrating to Microsoft Windows Active Directory and Exchange Microsoft is sponsoring the tour for goodness sake what do you think the answer will be Heres another hint the agenda includes Spotlight Migration Getting Secure The Preparation Phase Migrating Core Challenges Staying Secure Adopting Enforcing Policies Ill just bet they arent talking about migrating from Windows to NetWare When it was still called Banyan ePresence was one of Novells biggest competitors Now it seems ePresence has thrown in with the only networkingsoftware company thats attempting to challenge NetWare Thats understandable if disingenuous Perhaps it needs to publish a disclaimer along the lines of Weve been trying to get people to migrate away from NetWare for almost years we keep failing but we keep trying Microsoft of course is out to crush NetWare entirely That leaves BindView In the same newsletter last fall see newslettersnetwarehtml I suggested you email BindView and its head Eric Pulaski might work and tell them why you are not about to purchase new BindView products but also why youre replacing the ones you currently have Corporations only understand you when you speak dollars and cents evidently Now Im not suggesting that BindView or ePresence shouldnt be involved in the migration business they should be as long as someone is interested in buying their products and services What I object to is the use of a socalled objective presentation as a thinly veiled advertising medium You should object also By the way at the very bottom of the page describing the seminar aspabouteventaspmastercodeMSBSMI theres an email address to learn more about ePresence When I tried the link mailto I got the following response from the ePresence mail server Your message did not reach the following recipients The email address could not be found Perhaps the recipient moved to a different email organization or there was a mistake in the address Check the address and

By Dave Kearns MyRealBox is a free email service for anyone who wants to use it More importantly from our point of view its a demonstration site for Novells Internet Messaging System NIMS Ive mentioned before in this space that I didnt like Novells GroupWise even though or maybe because I formerly administered its predecessor WordPerfect Office for a half dozen years GroupWise is too complicated too nonstandard and too cluttered with unneeded by many functionality NIMS though suffers from none of those drawbacks Its simple straightforward messaging based on standard Simple Message Transfer Protocol tools which have driven email over the Internet for more than a dozen years It supports any e mail client even the GroupWise client as well as Microsofts Outlook and Outlook Express Eudora and many more that can handle the Post Office Protocol or Internet Message Access Protocol besides providing a Webbrowser based interface The latest version of NIMS also includes if you want to use it basic calendaring functions Its scalable up to mailboxes on a single server but is also written to take advantage of a multiprocessor or multiserver ie a cluster environment Its tightly coupled with NDSeDirectory for security supporting Secure Sockets Layer SSL the Open SSL implementation of Transport Layer Security and Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension protocols for the highest possible levels of encryption and security Typically in evaluating a messaging product you use a small test group of people to try it out then hope those results will scale to your entire enterprise Myrealboxcom though has current stats listed right on the home page with a link to more detailed stats for the cluster of mail servers running the program so that you can see for yourself what the performance is like NIMS is intended for large enterprises Fortune companies universities government departments and the like There is also a move to aim it at ISPs but that activity seems to have dropped recently While it might not be right for small businesses and small businesses get GroupWise thrown in when they buy NetWare Small Business Suite medium and largesized enterprises running NetWare servers should definitely consider it Even those without NetWare servers might reasonably look at it as an efficient secure mail server To contact Dave Kearns Dave Kearns is the Word Wrangler

tools By Dave Kearns Scripting tools have promised to make our jobs easier since the early days of personal computing Fifteen years ago it was batch files that drove a lot of the repetitive tasks we did Todays equivalent is Visual Basic Scripting VBS Unfortunately VBS has gotten a bad name for two seemingly opposing reasons On the one hand its considered easy for crackers and bad guys to exploit which has helped give rise to script kiddies a generation of punks who cant write scripts but use those written by others to attempt to disrupt your network On the other hand VBS is more difficult to grasp than the old DOS batch file language precisely because it is so powerful Many of you have probably turned off VBS processing wherever you can just to protect the network and your users from script kiddies But you might want to keep at least one machine ready to process them NetVision a visionary company with a real understanding of the NetWare market has just released a number of free scripts for use with its Policy Manager Suite see Realtime Directory Integration newslettersnetwarehtml for NetWare network administrators These can of course be modified to fit your circumstances but right out of the box or whatever the equivalent is for a free download the scripts can automate some tasks that you just havent been able to get to An example is deleting MP files as they are created on a NetWare server NetVisions scripts remove any specified file types such as MP JPG AVI and MPG that can unnecessarily tie up precious storage and bandwidth resources The scripts include Password Policy Enforcement Script This script reverses any unauthorized change to password information which can often create security holes in systems This script will reverse erroneous settings such as require password force periodic password changes days between changes limit grace logins and more Additionally through external event consumers administrators can log the action send a page or notification of the action or disable the user Reverses ACL changes to Root This script disables non admin perpetrator accounts by reversing any modifications to the root of the tree It also will disable the perpetrator account and the object that was changed Specified administrators can be excluded from the perpetrator filter Secured User Creates This script will disable both the user and the perpetrator if a user is created by anyone other than a specified group or listed objects The script will then block the account from view with an Inherited Rights Filter that is assigned to the security team At this point the team is notified and the unsecured actions have been terminated There are other scripts in the initial release and more are promised as theyre developed and tested

function Check it out at goadhtml Todays focus We have the answers By Dave Kearns Last weeks Network World included an opinion piece titled Finding grief instead of answers by Shari Loback In general it was about all vendors online tech support but she led with a diatribe about Novells online support forums that included both inaccurate and misleading information Loback who holds MCSE CNE and CCNA certifications is a network engineer at InPro and formed her impressions of Novells online forums after using only the Webbased front end Most veterans of that forum as well as other support venues will tell you that using the network news interface is much easier to read and follow Shes also mistaken in recalling that Novells forums provided timely helpful responses from Novell technicians who seemed to have a solid grasp of the products In fact Novells support forums havent been staffed by Novell employees in almost years since the very early days of NetWire on Compuserve The forums at forums have always been staffed by volunteers a motley but knowledgeable group of dedicated professionals formerly called the NetWare SysOps and then later called the Novell Support Connection Volunteers The group is now officially known as Novell Technical Support Volunteer SysOps but only by one or two people at Novell The volunteers form an eclectic group of individuals with experience in almost all areas of networking Most importantly these folks actually use the products they are supporting they arent just recent college grads reading an infobase Check the sysops bios at forumssysopinfohtml and youll find a fascinating group whose members are scattered around the world While often disagreeing with each other about most things these folks are united by their desire to deliver the most accurate and complete support information to the many users of the forums Loback does make some good points There is no longer a search function for the Web interface one is being developed but is not yet available Until then you can use Google Groups to search the forums Threading of messages also leaves a lot to be desired when viewed through the Web interface which can make it difficult for you to know when a reply to your question has been posted But if you are only an occasional user searching at advancedgroupsearchhlen using your own name as the author quickly returns your original question as well as any responses Even better use a newsreader like those built into Internet Explorer or Netscape and have all of the messages properly threaded for you Novells Support Connection forums are a great buy theyre free and provide great information as well as accurate ie no marketing allowed support The volunteers arent afraid to suggest nonNovell solutions where appropriate If you arent using these forums then you arent providing the best support for your network Disclaimer Dave Kearns was a founding sysop of NetWire on Compuserve and still volunteers his

projects The Direction Gnrale des Impts DGI the French version of the IRS is setting up a directory system that will be used by million French taxpayers We knew this was in the works and tried to announce it six months ago but the lawyers kept arguing over which Is should be dotted and which Es get an acute accent Finally though the story can be told and its one that puts Novell at the very forefront of egovernment initiatives Previous egovernment projects in the UK and Canada along with some ongoing but lower profile initiatives in the US and outside of Utah were exciting and fairly large in size One example is the UKs Bracknell Forest egovernment initiative which empowered over citizens to conduct government business through a Web browser see Directory takes center stage in egovernment initiative newslettersdirdirhtml But million The DGI will use Novells eDirectory iChain and DirXML products that you should be using if you need to have an extranet Web presence for customers clients or citizens On a related note the city of Brompton Ontario just after Christmas announced a major buyin to ZENWorks for Desktops newsleadstoriesdec The software will be used by the citys workers that have computers While thats not million people it is more directly related to what most of you are dealing with on your networks PC and software configuration If you are involved in the government sector though theres a new Novell Cool Solutions Web site just for you at coolsolutionsgovindexhtml It already contains a lot of interesting information but promises to be THE place for government IT professionals to hang out Check out the site and let the advisory board know what youd like to see or what youd like to see changed My good friend Lindsey Johnstone at Novell how would

ships NetWare preinstalled Dear Wincenty Kaminski In this issue Dell finishes testing NetWare Links related to Novell NetWare Featured reader resource PRODUCT INFO IN ONE CONVENIENT LOCATION Heard about a new product launch Curious to find out if the features and benefits of this new product will meet your critical business needs Network World Fusions Product Central section includes all the info you need to make informed decision about new products and also includes a product finder function Check it out at goadhtml Todays focus Dell ships NetWare preinstalled By Dave Kearns Either due to the vagaries of publishing schedules the end of year holidays my move from Texas to California or just downright perversity it seems that within days of the Dec newsletter about the hunt for preinstalled NetWare servers going out Dell announced that it has finished its certification tests for the operating system and is offering it preinstalled on new servers Indeed the very page I pointed to on Dells Web site goNWAhtml which in early December had said that NetWare was still undergoing testing now says in big bold letters of course Dell completes certification and now fully supports NetWare This led to quite a bit of confusion on the part of readers who were a day or two late reading that particular newsletter Just to set the record completely straight heres the chronology NetWare shipped in September Compaq was shipping it preinstalled by the beginning of November Early in December Dell was still testing but by the middle of the month sometime around Dec and it finished testing and began shipping NetWare preinstalled Of course the one feature Dell is touting for NetWare is its accelerated video drivers for NetWare and NetWare on PowerEdge servers Yes sir nothing I want to do more than watch movies on my server console Ah well the important thing is that you can buy NetWare pre installed on PowerEdge servers and PowerVault StorageArea Network servers While youre visiting the Web site with Dells announcement click on the NetWare White Papers link or go directly to usenesgtopicspowerpsqmainhtm for a fascinating account of how Dell is upgrading to NetWare the hundreds of NetWare servers it uses in production Itll make your little network seem puny But then thats one of the great features of NetWare no matter the size of your network it seems small because it needs so little administrative handholding To contact Dave Kearns Dave Kearns is a writer and consultant in Silicon Valley His most recent book is Peter Nortons Complete Guide to
