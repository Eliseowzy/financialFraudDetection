cc Susan J ES Jeff nron Mona Petrochko Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports Attached is a version of AB I refer you to pages through which discusses Sections through Residual CTCs may have two connotations The first connotation is the type of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period For example the California IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates From those frozen rates delive ry and procurement costs are subtracted What is left over residually is the recovery of CTCs The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs that are recovered after the frozen rate period Due to these two possible interpretations I believe that either the term residual CTCs needs to be defined or a better definition of the PreRolloff Period and PostRollof f Period After reading the cites that I referred to above if you believe the definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections and then I will be comfortable with the current language My concern was that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section that would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers and only benefit and protect Standard Offer customers Pursuant to Section the IOUs implemented co st recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section I a m worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in a the PostRolloff periods that may look like the

Customer Roger Can you suggest a definition youd be comfortable with which references the code section I have not seen the code but your point is valid although I was under the impression residual

Section gii The problem is that I cannot find Section gi in the contract Further the definition of PreRolloff Period which states ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to

bundled price for a shorter period than expected Conversely if the rate freeze ends later th an how we priced it then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than we had priced This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil e of our California portfolio My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is defined It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose ends Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of the transition period which is a critical date because the delivery risks hinge on that definition I just want to do some preventative maintenance such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future However we
