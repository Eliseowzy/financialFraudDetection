Chronicle Home in the Heights Martin Hajovsky Help on the way Tribute fundraiser for rescue workers set for Fire Station THE Heights is a long way from the sites of Sept s terrorist attacks but thanks to a local couple Heights residents will have the opportunity to come together to send their help to those communities A tribute and fundraiser to support New York City and Washington DC firefighters will be held at the Heights Fire Station pm Sunday The event is described by Houston Heights Association president Laura Thorp as a community gathering and fundraiser to show our support and honor the firefighters that gave their lives during the recent attacks in New York City and Washington DC Money raised from this event will be donated equally to New York Firefighters Disaster Relief Fund and the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund The fundraiser is the brainchild of Heights residents Nanci and John Lamar who are both New York natives I grew up in the city getting halfprice tickets to go up to the top of the World Trade Center so this really hit home for me said Nanci Lamar My parents are still in the city They were on a train when it happened and someone came on the loudspeaker to tell everyone what was going on The Lamars whose son Ayars will turn on Oct were on a vacation in New Orleans the weekend after the attacks when the idea hit them to hold a fundraiser It was my husbands idea more than mine Nanci Lamar said But we were sitting at dinner in New Orleans and thought what a great resource we have in the neighborhood with the Fire Station and what a great place it would be to have such an event On Sept the Lamars presented their idea to the Houston Heights Associations board of directors meeting The idea met with support but with one caveat We saw right away that it was a great idea so we decided to sponsor it but we told them Youre the chairs said Thorp We had no idea what that really meant but we also knew that it was the least we could do said Lamar Yet the sentiment that weve heard from everyone and the help theyre giving to put this event on has been so inspiring This is more than a fundraiser its the community coming together to show our strength Thorp agreed John and Nanci are showing the true spirit of neighborhood here she said Its a rally to bring the neighborhood together and remember these people and give our support Since then the Lamars have been working nonstop to put together a first class event Houston Fire Chief Chris Connealy is scheduled to appear along with fire trucks and local fire fighters A singer from Opera in the Heights will lead the crowd in song and letters to the relief and rescue workers from area schools will be on display There will also be paper on hand for people to add to the letter pile and a large banner for people to sign that will be sent to the workers along with the donation Refreshments will include popcorn snow cones and soft drinks Kids can write letters and hang them up when theyre there Everyone will be able to come together in a show of community support Nanci Lamar said We didnt even know whether or not the Fire Station would be available so we were thankful that the Heights Association could make it available Its booked all the way to Christmas and therell be a wedding that night so well be downstairs which turns out to be perfect for us The images on the television have been horrific for the last two weeks but Lamar said that one image in particular is what continues to motivate her and her husband When we saw those firefighters rushing up into those burning buildings and getting everyone to race down That was so moving and really got us thinking about doing something to recognize these people she said Lamar is familiar with the process of healing amidst pain and tragedy in her professional role as a social worker and understands how important it is for people to come together at times of shared pain Im a private social worker and letting people tell their stories is a big part of counseling she said Similarly having people come together to express their thoughts in the aftermath of this unimaginable event is something that hopefully can be inspiring Just speaking for myself seeing the response has been so inspiring to me There are a lot of people that we dont even know in our neighborhood but this has really brought us all together with people that we would not have connected with otherwise Everyone is just a person and were all going through this That has been real inspiring and a real lesson for me This is a looking forward and a demonstration of our strength as a community That is as important as the fundraising aspect of it CROQUET CHALLENGE The Classic Croquet Challenge a benefit fundraiser for the Boulevard Beautification Project is set for am to pm Oct at the Houston Polo Club The event is sponsored by the Houston Heights Association the City of Houston Parks and Recreation Department and the Houston
