<27565005.1075847636154.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.schoen@enron.com,2001-02-09 07:58:00,Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Ordersis a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state

Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of

agrees to clean air State environmentalists Public Service announce Clean Air agreement By MIKE RECHT Associated Press Writer Nov Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved CONCORD NH AP The state environmentalists and Public Service Company of New Hampshire announced a compromise agreement Tuesday they say will cut air pollution The plan would make New Hampshire the first state to pass legislation to reduce four major pollutants from fossil fuelburning power plants although Massachusetts and Connecticut have approved regulations on some of the gases An attempt failed last spring to pass a more stringent bill that Public Service a subsidiary of Berlin Connbased Northeast Utilities did not support or oppose This agreement represents a version put together by environmentalists the state and the utility Ken Colburn director of the Air Resource Division of the Department of Environmental Resources said a compromise bill is better than no bill at all Im not a believer in the jackpot theory of environmental progress he said after the Statehouse news conference to announce the agreement Rep Jeb Bradley chairman of the House Science Technology and Energy Committee acknowledged it is a much smaller reduction proposal than the earlier bill But he said it is significant because it moves in the right direction Gov Jeanne Shaheen who proposed last years plan said the amended Clean Power Act is essential to the health of our citizens the protection of our environment and our states future economic success Shaheen said the agreement means Public Services three coalburning plants in Bow Portsmouth and Newington will have to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide the chief cause of acid rain nitrogen oxide which causes smog carbon dioxide which affects climate change and eventually mercury which threatens the health of humans and wildlife Public Service president Gary Long said the agreement would cost the utility about million annually or less than percent of a customers average bill Representatives of the Audubon Society Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests New Hampshire Lung Association New Hampshire Lakes Association and others joined in applauding the agreement Missing however was the Clean Water Coalition and the Public Interest Research Group which panned the agreement Steve Blackledge of PIRG said the bill does not require Public Service to reduce overall emissions or to make onsite improvements to reduce emissions I still think we can get more and need to get more in terms of real reductions he said Catherine Corkery of the New Hampshire Sierra Club which is part of the Clean Power Coalition said it was not asked to take part in the discussions on the bill and Blackledge said PIRG also was not invited However Corkery said including carbon dioxide in the agreement is awesome That sends a strong message on the federal level she said President Bush has delayed carbon dioxide cuts to allow further study of the economic consequences and global warming Doug Bogen of Clean Water Action and the Clean Air Coalition an ad hoc group of environmental and public health organizations said the amended agreement doesnt go nearly far enough It doesnt require emission reductions it allows unlimited trading of pollution credits He predicted environmental groups and others will oppose the pact when the Legislature convenes Were hoping it can be made stronger and we are working with some legislators to do that but obviously they have a lot of people supporting this he said Long said the less stringent amended bill takes a more reasonable approach to reducing mercury emissions waiting to set a standard until more is known about it It also retained the utilitys ability to choose between cutting pollution from its own plants or buying pollution credits from other industries that can achieve more economical emission reductions One of the complaints about the earlier credits was that they could be bought from companies so far away it would do no good for New Hampshire Bradley said the measure also takes a slower approach on carbon dioxide controls and offers incentives for Public Service to buy pollution credits from other industries closer to New Hampshire Blackledge still had problems with the credit buying The trading is so broad and gives so much leeway it will be far easier for the utility to trade than make onsite improvements he said Bradley said coalburning plants are needed to provide diversity in energy supplies and without the ability to buy pollution credits Public Service could not continue to operate the plants What weve tried to do is cut a reasonable course one that ensures the plants can continue to operate but at the same time make environmental progress and do it in a way thats costeffective and maintains diversity of fuel resources

able to run at higher levels this year but may face severe curtailments in future years I do think there are a couple of noteworthy precedence within these rules One is the increased validity and recognition of need of alternate source o f emission offsets This rule development had active participation by CARB a nd the USEPA who bought off on these provisions The second is the use of the mitigation bank for generators CARB has developed a similar bank for new peaking turbines but this program has much broader application And finally this is the first time Ive seen environmental dispatch provisions codified For those of you that want more details see below I also have summaries o f the rules and comments on the rules Please give me a call if you have questions or want the documentation Please forward this to anyone Ive missed Mary Schoen Environmental Strategies Power Producing Facilities The proposed rule changes will separate power producing facilities from the rest of the RECLAIM market while energy supply issues are being addressed Existing power plants will not rejoin the full RECLAIM program unless the Governing Board in a public hearing prior to July determines that their reentry will not result in any negative impact on the remainder of t he RECLAIM universe or Californias energy security needs The proposed rul es would require a compliance plan for power producing facilities with capacit y megawatts and require installation of best available retrofit control technology at the earliest feasible date but no later than for boiler s or for turbines In addition to the initial compliance plans power producing facilities are required to update information annually for through Compliance Years Annual update reports provide AQMD with the necessary information to access the impacts of emissions from these facilities on the RECLAIM program and anticipate future demands of credits from the Mitigation Fee Program The proposed rules also include environmental dispatch which requires prioritization of the use of cleaner emitting equipment first Trading would also be limited to isolate the rest of the market from credit demands from power producing facilities RTC purchases after January could only be used to reconcile facility emissions if the RTCs are from facilities under common ownership or have been generated from approved mobi le source credit generation programs Power Producing Facilities could sell credits back to the District for a price not to exceed per pound Any emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the payment of a mitigation fee of per pound per ton to the District which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction projects to mitigat e the air pollution effects Compliance Plans and Forecast Reports for other Facilities For facilities other than large power producing facilities compliance plan s are proposed for facilities with or any subsequent year emissions greater than or equal to tons per year tpy These compliance plans provide flexibility by including options for installing controls or purchasing credits The plans are being designed to allow as much flexibili ty as possible while requiring timely enforceable commitments to be made to ensure compliance Facilities may provide several options in their original plan submittal and can amend their compliance plans at any time The Board resolution directs staff to expedite review and approval of compliance plan s and plan modifications days for plans and days for modification Facilities between and tpy emissions in will be required to subm it informational forecast reports and update forecasts annually Compliance plans and forecast reports from the large and medium facilities will help ensure adequate advance planning by facilities to meet the overall RECLAIM program emission targets Mitigation Fee Program A temporary mitigation fee program through compliance year is proposed for power producing facilities that exceed their RTC holdings The facility would pay per pound of NOx to the District which uses the funds to achieve emission reductions from a variety of mobile source or other credit generation avenues The current rules require that excess emissions be deducted from the subsequent year allocation to ensure that the environment is not impacted by additional emissions In this proposed amendment staff recommends the deduction of excess emissions from the second year to accoun t for the lead time necessary for installation of control equipment at the power producing facilities When emission reductions are secured for the Reserve by the District the deduction would be credited back to the facility In addition if the mitigation fee program achieves emission reductions equal to at least percent of those requested in aggregate b y the second compliance year an additional year can be granted to generate reductions thereby minimizing the need to further deduct future year allocations RECLAIM Air Quality Investment Program AQIP Another shortterm credit assistance program the RECLAIM AQIP is being proposed for use by certain facilities through the compliance year Th is program would be available for structural buyers such as new facilities an d small facilities with installed controls at a minimum of BARCT The RECLAIM AQIP would provide structural buyers additional compliance options to reduc e the overall demand for RTCs from the RECLAIM trading market Facilities tha t request participation would pay per pound of NOx to use the RECLAIM AQIP if reductions are available No deduction from allocations is propose d for this program since emission reductions must be available prior to use The District is prefunding the AQIP program with emission reduction credit s The Governing Board has allocated million from the AES Settlement Fund t o use to obtain emission reductions from marine vessels Other Rule Changes To help improve trade information the proposed rules would require identification of both the seller and buyer of RTCs after the completion of a trade The rule includes registration requirements for pooled trading and contractual agreements for future transfer of RTCs In addition timely filing of trades is proposed to help facilitate market information

Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

to the RECLAIM Program The key elements of these modifications are as follows For existing large power plants greater than MW bifurcation from the rest of the RECLAIM market requiring installation of Best Available Retrof it Control Technology BARCT through compliance plans to be installed no lat er than for boilers and for turbines and a temporary mitigation fe e program Any emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the payment of a mitigation fee of per pound per ton to the District which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction projects to mitigate the air pollution effects These rule changes includ e an environmental dispatch provision which requires prioritization of the us e of cleaner emitting equipment first Initiation of a temporary limited pilot RECLAIM Air Quality Investment Program AQIP for new power plants and structural buyers allowing access to mobile and area source credits Development of four new pilot credit generation rules which are voluntary a nd are applicable to a specific type of mobile or area source emission reducti on project as summarized below Rule applies to dieselfueled captive marine vessels where the existing marine engine is repowered or replaced with a new dieselfueled marine engine Rule applies to marine vessels that are anchored in district harbors or ports that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines to provide power for lights ventilation loading offloading and other hotelling operations Rule applies to truck or trailer refrigeration units that are mounte d on a truck body or trailer container that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines while at distribution centers Rule applies to dieselfueled engines that are replaced with electri c motors that are used to power agricultural pumps Summary of Impact of Modifications The South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD introduced these n ew rules to reduce the impact of CAs electricity crisis the need to increas e generation on the RECLAIM trading credit RTC market and to do their part to facilitate increased electricity supply These amendments are intended to stabilize RTC prices by increasing supply reducing demand and increasing trading information and accuracy There is one major IF built into these rules It involves the mitigation fee program for existing large power plants IF the AQMD fails to produce adequate reductions for the mitigation fee program power producing facilities would have allowances deducted from future year allocations to cover their emissions In otherwords they would be able to run at higher levels this year but may face severe curtailments in future years I do think there are a couple of noteworthy precedence within these rules One is the increased validity and recognition of need of alternate source o f emission offsets This rule development had active participation by CARB a nd the USEPA who bought off on these provisions The second is the use of the mitigation bank for generators CARB has developed a similar bank for new peaking turbines but this program has much broader application And finally this is the first time Ive seen environmental dispatch provisions codified For those of you that want more details see below I also have summaries o f the rules and comments on the rules Please give me a call if you have questions or want the documentation Please forward this to anyone Ive missed Mary Schoen Environmental Strategies Power Producing Facilities The proposed rule changes will separate power producing facilities from the rest of the RECLAIM market while energy supply issues are being addressed Existing power plants will not rejoin the full RECLAIM program unless the Governing Board in a public hearing prior to July determines that their reentry will not result in any negative impact on the remainder of t he RECLAIM universe or Californias energy security needs The proposed rul es would require a compliance plan for power producing facilities with capacit y megawatts and require installation of best available retrofit control technology at the earliest feasible date but no later than for boiler s or for

necessary information to access the impacts of emissions from these facilities on the RECLAIM program and anticipate future demands of credits from the Mitigation Fee Program The proposed rules also include environmental dispatch which requires prioritization of the use of cleaner emitting equipment first Trading would also be limited to isolate the rest of the market from credit demands from power producing facilities RTC purchases after January could only be used to reconcile facility emissions if the RTCs are from facilities under common ownership or have been generated from approved

offset by the payment of a mitigation fee of per pound per ton to the District which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction projects to mitigat e the air pollution effects Compliance Plans and Forecast Reports for other Facilities For facilities other than large power producing facilities compliance plan s are proposed for facilities with or any subsequent year emissions greater than or equal to tons per year tpy These compliance plans provide flexibility by including options for installing controls or purchasing credits The plans are being designed to allow as much flexibili

emissions in will be required to subm it informational forecast reports and update forecasts annually Compliance plans and forecast reports from the large and medium facilities will help ensure adequate advance planning by facilities to meet the overall RECLAIM program emission targets Mitigation Fee Program A temporary mitigation fee program through compliance year is proposed for power producing facilities that exceed their RTC holdings The facility would pay per pound of NOx to the District which uses the funds to achieve emission reductions from a variety of mobile source or other credit generation avenues The current rules require that excess emissions be deducted from the subsequent year allocation to ensure that the environment is not impacted by additional emissions In this proposed amendment staff recommends the deduction of excess emissions from the second year to accoun t for the lead time necessary for installation of control equipment at the power producing facilities When emission reductions are secured for the Reserve by the District the deduction would be credited back to the facility In addition if the mitigation fee program achieves emission reductions equal to at least percent of those requested in aggregate b y the second compliance year an additional year can be granted to generate reductions thereby minimizing the need to further deduct future year allocations RECLAIM Air Quality Investment Program AQIP Another shortterm credit assistance program the RECLAIM AQIP is being proposed for use by certain facilities through the compliance year Th is program would be available for structural buyers such as new facilities an d small facilities with installed controls at a minimum of BARCT The RECLAIM AQIP would provide

<19906489.1075843737914.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.schoen@enron.com,2001-02-09 07:58:00,Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Ordersis a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units
