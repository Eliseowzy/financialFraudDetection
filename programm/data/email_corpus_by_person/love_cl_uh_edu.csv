<218063.1075841081030.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,love@cl.uh.edu,2001-10-31 09:42:18,RE Estate Cc PST Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville She obviouly has not done that The day after Daddy died we went to the bank to get his will to take to Jeffs office for him to read to us Glenda tried to cash in Daddys CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his estate They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had not been formally appointed Glenda told me that she had told Dr Cashin that she wanted him to pay off the note on the purchase of Daddys practice immediately Im surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to court I am fine with that However my terms are The money in Daddys checking account saving account and CD are put back in to the estate The estate s Glenda for the forgiveness of the note The value of Daddys truck that she gave away comes out of her distribution The repayment of the that Glenda borrowed from me in April is repaid to me at annual interest from Glendas distribution of the estate If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddys death that an independent third party is appointed administrator Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my family I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy I am willing to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddys death Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his I will allow her to keep my grandfathers single shot shotgun that Daddy left to me but that she and her husband stole from my fathers bedroom while he was in the hosptal dying I would even be willing to not make her repay the value of Daddys truck or return the extra that she sold his car for but that she did not put in the estate I mailed the check today Sorry for the delay Ive just been very busy If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix Ill need a new one with the correct date of Daddys death to execute Ill be in Auburn from
