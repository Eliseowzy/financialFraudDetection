items for MDEA Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities

items for MDEA Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around Thanks Kay

b All section references in the draft should be reviewed and checked The majority of the references checked were incorrect Kay c Since financial security is still an outstanding issue all comments regarding the provisions in the draft pertaining to that subject have been excluded Kay d The draft contains references throughout to exhibits that will be attach ed to the agreement that were not

drafts were with the definition for savings so it is important to review a draft of these exhibits as soon as possible ReaganKayneDaveJeff to chech with Marvin He should have forwarded exhibits with everything else time is running out on them to do anything here Will report more on this issue Section b This section obligates EPMI to Propose a load pr ojection and stack model Should this say Prepare as opposed to Propose Prepare is fine Section c First line refers to a request by Customer Cus tomer is not defined is this intended to refer to MDEA If not include a definiti on of Customer upon request by Customer is not necessary This has already been done Section a Provides that EPMI will use commercially reasonable efforts The draft does not include a definition for this term Sugge

minimize the c ost of serving MDEAs native load Adding this seems fine however are th ere any legal implications Kay If not add it in Section c Line refers to Cajun and EPI which are not defined in

Facilities and Entergy interconnection obligations in accordance with Prudent Operating Practices and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement b Responsibilities for operating reliably with respect to Native Load lie s solely with MDEA and the Cities Section The fourth sentence states due to the use of imprecis e data such as weather reports heat rate estimates and the like it is understood between the Parties that the resulting projections recommendations and daily plan are consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices According to this provision the parties agree in advance that the resulting projections recommendations and daily plans are consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices We believe tha t the use of that type of data is consistent with commercially reason able industry practices but do not believe that that this automatically translates into the projections themselves being consistent with commercial ly reasonable industry practices Text should be changed as appropriate to reflect this change ReaganKayneDaveJeff Rorschach Reagan Section Each day EPMI shall provide a projection of the next days Native Load and project the need for gas fuel oil and p ower Each day EPMI and MDEA shall jointly run the Load Projection Model and the Facility Stack Model EPMI and MDEA will then compare and verify assumptions and results from the models develop recommendations and decide upon the operating plan for the day This analysis will take into account such considerations as weather conditions business dayweekend and holiday load conditions historical loads gaspower pricing unit availabilities unit operating data and prior commitments to buy and sell power The Parties understand and agree that the development of the projections recommendations and daily operating plan is complex and requir es an element of judgment Further it is understood that the use of imprecis e data such as weather reports and heat rate estimates to make such projections recommendations and daily plan are consistent with commerciall y reasonable industry practices Section Second sentence provides Risk of loss and all price an d unit

shall be entitled to audit and adding An independent auditor reasonably acceptable to MDEA Kay Article As we have previously noted this section contains language related to conflict of interest issues

RE Open items for MDEA Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports It

items for MDEA Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around Thanks Kay
