we are proceeding under the same schedule Several rehearing re quests were submitted including one for ENAEES However note the follow ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENAEES western commercia l and government affairs folks I noted you deleted your message without re ading it I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O MB ruling a good sign As detailed in the attached FERC notice the Office of Management and Budge t OMB has approved FERCs Information Collection Request for Reporting o f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market through the sixmonth emergen cy period that will expire on Emergency reporting requirements a re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations Howev er it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re porting requirements could be extended OMB has advised FERC that if it decides to request renewal of the Informat ion Collection Request after that date it must address certain issues as p art of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit di scussion As you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of th e FERC order ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERCs estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co llection of information We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep o ur records in that manner We manage our business on an aggregated basis and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale We stated that we might even have to hire fulltime staff to dedicate to the task The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo rting requirements past FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through to coincide w ith the end date of its mitigation plan OMB questioned the practical uti lity of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they d id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d ata manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation woul d likely be artificial OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti mates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of th e names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision At the least it sen ds a signal Original Message From Nicolay Christi L SentTuesday September AM ToCantrell Rebecca W SubjectFW Two proceeding changes

commercia l and government affairs folks I noted you deleted your message without re ading it I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O MB ruling a good sign As detailed in the attached FERC notice the Office of Management and Budge t OMB has approved FERCs Information Collection Request for Reporting o f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market through the sixmonth emergen cy period that will expire on Emergency reporting requirements a re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations Howev er it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re porting requirements could be extended OMB has advised FERC that if it decides to request renewal of the Informat ion Collection Request after that date it must address certain issues as p art of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit di scussion As you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of th e FERC order ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERCs estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co llection of information We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep o ur records in that manner We manage our business on an aggregated basis and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale We stated that we might even have to hire fulltime staff to dedicate to the task The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo rting requirements past FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through to coincide w ith the end date of its mitigation plan OMB questioned the practical uti lity of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they d id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d ata manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation woul d likely be artificial OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti mates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of th e names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be that

Violate Rules Judge Says Update FYI El Paso Dealings Appear to Violate Rules Judge Says Update By Jim Polson Washington Aug Bloomberg El Paso Corp may have violated federal rules by letting its merchant energy unit outbid rivals for capacity on a naturalgas pipeline into California a federal regulatory judge said Curtis Wagner a US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief judge is investigating accusations that the El Paso unit locked up more than a billion feet of capacity so other gas suppliers couldnt use it California utilities and government officials say El Paso used the transaction to cut the states gas supplies and drive up prices Wagner said he was disturbed by a transcript of telephone conversations between an El Paso merchantenergy executive and a salesman from the companys pipeline unit who appeared to exchange information ensuring no rival could get the capacity If thats not hankypanky theres no such thing Wagner said at the hearing This is the kind of stuff we passed affiliate standards to prevent and now its out in the open I want to know if this sort of thing goes on every day and I think the commission wants to know too Patricia Shelton El Paso pipeline unit president disputed the judges interpretation saying the two men hadnt reached an agreement and that El Paso had followed FERCs rules properly The El Paso units didnt discuss the bidding process in advance said Mark T Mitchell who handled the trading units bid The telephone call mentioned by Wagner didnt affect the bid Mitchell said Shares of El Paso fell or percent to They have fallen percent this year El Pasos pipeline network is the biggest in North America at more than miles long The Houstonbased company also owns a separate merchanttrading unit that buys and sells gas FERC Rules Under FERC rules El Paso must give everyone who wants to move gas on its US interstate pipelines an equal opportunity to bid for access The rules also discourage or ban the companys pipeline and merchant units from sharing many types of information FERC is investigating why the average price of natural gas jumped almost fivefold in California in the first quarter from a year earlier and why prices in the state are higher than elsewhere in the US Californias average electricity prices soared more than ninefold earlier in the first quarter in part because of the cost of gas used to fuel many power plants New hearings into the issue started yesterday and participants expect them to continue into next week The judge held weeks of hearings on El Pasos role in California earlier this summer In addition to Californias regulators plaintiffs in the case included the states two largest utilities PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co El Paso Chairman William Wise testified May that he didnt come up with the plan to have the merchant unit bid for the pipeline capacity though he did approve it Wise said he didnt speak to the pipeline group about the contract El Paso Chief Executive Wont Testify at Gas Hearing Update By Jim Polson Washington Aug Bloomberg El Paso Corp faces federal sanctions on its pipeline system the longest in the US if federal officials conclude its units violated rules on bidding for California pipeline capacity Curtis Wagner US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law judge said the company may lose its case because Chief Executive William Wise and other executives refused to counter evidence that El Paso favored its energytrading unit in bidding for more than a billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity Wagner has a wide range of sanctions he may recommend to the commission by Oct FERC spokeswoman Tamara YoungAllen said Testimony ended today The burden of proof has now shifted to El Paso Corp from Californias utilities and state regulators Wagner said after testimony by executives of El Pasos pipeline and energy trading units He said he might rule against El Paso without persuasive testimony by Wise In the end we will be vindicated El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said El Paso attorneys said Wise and other executives would only answer questions from Wagner The judge said if they took the stand they also would have to answer questions from California attorneys When El Paso refused Wagner adjourned the hearing Gas Prices The FERC is looking into why the average price of gas jumped almost fivefold in California during the first quarter compared to a year earlier and why prices there are higher than elsewhere in the country Gas is used to fuel many power plants and the average price of electricity at the CaliforniaOregon border soared more than ninefold earlier this year California utilities and government officials say El Paso used the transaction last year to cut the states gas supplies and drive up prices Wagner said he was disturbed by a transcript of telephone conversations between an El Paso merchantenergy executive and a salesman from the companys pipeline unit who appeared to exchange information ensuring no rival could get the capacity If ever a deal was made there was a deal made there Wagner said He discounted testimony by El Paso pipeline and trading executives that the discussion was proper under federal rules and gave the trading unit no advantage in the bidding An April memorandum to Wise and the head of El Pasos pipeline unit details what must happen for El Paso Merchant Energy to make it on the contract Wagner said If ever there were playing both sides of the fence thats it Wise testified before Wagner in May during the first round of hearings Competition Rules Under FERC rules El Paso must give everyone who wants to move gas on its US interstate pipelines an equal opportunity to bid for access The rules also discourage or ban the companys pipeline and merchant units from sharing many types of information In March FERC exonerated El Paso of allegations it had favored its trading affiliate in pipeline capacity bidding and ordered Wagner to hold hearings on whether it had manipulated gas prices In June after days of hearings that included testimony by Wise and others the commission allowed Wagner to expand his inquiry to include the handling of the pipeline contract Attorneys on both sides will make final arguments to Wagner in briefs due Aug Shares of El Paso fell to They have fallen percent this year

of the year AGA will continue to follow the Storage Survey Procedures and Methodology as shown at StatsStudies statsstudies Looks like you have to have a password to access this site AGA is discontinuing the survey primarily because it was taking increasingly more staff time and effort to calculate and post the survey estimates this drained resources committed to other programs more beneficial to its members AGA is planning to continue a wide range of other programs conducted on behalf of AGA members and their customers These programs are more fully described on AGAs website wwwagaorg and reports to members AGA will ask the US Energy Information Administration EIA to consider publishing the storage estimates EIA currently collects on a more timely basis and to simplify its data collection process AGAs weekly storage estimates have closely tracked EIAs numbers over the past seven years AGA estimates are currently issued three working days after the weekly reporting period ends while EIA storage data is often published a month or more after the end of the reporting period Subscribers to the AGA storage survey may also obtain storage data from commercial providers

<5055706.1075852475927.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,w..cantrell@enron.com,2001-08-30 09:06:44,NGI Article Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated DealsNGIs Daily Gas Price Index published August Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourserate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates Mary Kay Miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd that subsequently entered into negotiatedrate transactions But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted Even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said Miller Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern were null and void The only relevant ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan she noted Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its preposting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiatedrate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as MMBtu last February far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of centsMMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiatedrate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total MMBtud of service on Transwestern during February and March Richardson and Sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony The two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern Richardson or Sempra she noted Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E Sullivan to the contrary Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates Miller testified Sullivan an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets Tariffs and Rates OMTR Division of Litigation contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates see Daily GPI Aug subscribersdailynewsdehtml In fact he believes the preposting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiatedrate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available But Miller counters that Sullivan offers not support for his claim She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson in response to a data request by Southern California Edison support Transwesterns claims Both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate The capacity at issue was offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including Richardson or Sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate Sullivan contends that Transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiatedrate transactions at the expense of recourserate deals was pure profit Under questioning by Thomas J Burgess of FERCs OMTR Miller conceded that Transwestern earned million from Sempra Energys contract in March million from Richardsons March contract and a comparable amount from Richardsons February contract She noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of Sempras February contract but she didnt provide an exact figure FERCs Sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the Sempra February contract was more than million Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwesterns coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates But Miller countered that the Commissions negotiatedrate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits Furthermore she said the Transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiatedrate policy as Sullivan has suggested This case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiatedrate policy should only be done on an industrywide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged

commercia l and government affairs folks I noted you deleted your message without re ading it I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O MB ruling a good sign As detailed in the attached FERC notice the Office of Management and Budge t OMB has approved FERCs Information Collection Request for Reporting o f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market through the sixmonth emergen cy period that will expire on Emergency reporting requirements a re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations Howev er it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re porting requirements could be extended OMB has advised FERC that if it decides to request renewal of the Informat ion Collection Request after that date it must address certain issues as p art of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit di scussion As you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of th e FERC order ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERCs estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co llection of information We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep o ur records in that manner We manage our business on an aggregated basis and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale We stated that we might even have to hire fulltime staff to dedicate to the task The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo rting requirements past FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through to coincide w ith the end date of its mitigation plan OMB questioned the practical uti lity of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they d id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d ata manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation woul d likely be artificial OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti mates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of th e names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be that

storage estimates At present AGA intends to publish the last survey on Wednesday January This final survey will estimate working gas in storage for the week ending Friday December effectively the end of the year AGA will continue to follow the Storage Survey Procedures and Methodology as shown at StatsStudies statsstudies Looks like you have to have a password to access this site AGA is discontinuing the survey primarily because it was taking increasingly more staff time and effort to calculate and post the survey estimates this drained resources committed to other programs more beneficial to its members AGA is planning to continue a wide range of other programs conducted on behalf of AGA members and their customers These programs are more fully described on AGAs website wwwagaorg and reports to members AGA will ask the US Energy Information Administration EIA to consider publishing the storage estimates EIA currently collects on a more timely basis and to simplify its data collection process AGAs weekly storage estimates have closely tracked EIAs numbers over the past seven years AGA estimates are currently issued three working days after the weekly reporting period ends while EIA storage data is often published a month or more after the end of the reporting period Subscribers to the AGA storage survey may also obtain storage data from commercial providers

I get a copy of Southern Unions initial brief below if you have it Thanks Bryan Original Message From Cantrell Rebecca W Sent Monday August PM To Hull Bryan Cc Lawner Leslie Subject RE Section Bryan As I stated earlier my impression of this is that Commissioner Wood is aware of the conflict between PGE now EPGT and Southern Union probably because of lobbying by Southern Union and that is why he raised the issue Southern Union states in its initial brief below that it opposes the high demand rates that it says EPGT proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of Order No and argues that FERC should impose Order No standards on PGE I was watching a video stream of the meeting and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere Here are the facts in this case On December PGE Texas Pipeline LP the predecessor to EPGT Texas Pipeline LP filed a petition with FERC for approval of transportation rates under Section along as they were required to do All intrastate pipelines that perform Section service must either have their rates approved by FERC or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service PGEs filing proposed in addition to the usual interruptible service a firm Section service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service PGE also filed a revised Statement of Operating Conditions to reflect the new services On February Southern Union Gas Company an intrastate transportation customer of PGE filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing PGE opposed the late intervention but FERC granted it on April PGE stated that Southern Union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service Southern Union submitted data requests to PGE on April and April PGE attempted to get a protective order issued but FERC rejected their request A settlement conference was held on September A Staff Panel was convened on October in order to conduct an advisory nonevidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues with instructions to make recommendations to the Commission within days On November FERC requested pages of additional information from PGE in order to complete the application in the proceeding which PGE provided on November th On December th PGE provided additional information in response to a FERC data request On January Southern Union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by PGE On January El Paso Field Services informed FERC that PGE Texas Pipeline LP had been acquired by El Paso on December and that the name was changed to EPGT Texas Pipeline LP On January EPGT Texas and Southern Union filed initial briefs On July EPGT filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at FERC summarized below where Commissioner Wood inquired about the extension of some Order No and provisions to Section service providers EPGT stated that if FERC proceeds with this policy it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding On July Southern Union filed reply comments opposing EPGTs supplemental comments On August EPGT filed an amended Statement of Operating Conditions which provides for electronic nominations two additional nomination cycles bumping clarified and updated credit provisions modified quality provisions to protect system integrity and more clearly defined authorized overrun service The NGPA gives FERC authority over intrastate pipeline rates for Section service and requires that such service be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis but there is some question as to whether it gives FERC authority to require for example compliance with Order Nos and Please let me know if this is enough detail or maybe its more than you wanted Original Message From Hull Bryan Sent Monday August PM To Cantrell Rebecca W Subject RE Section Becky Im hoping you can help me with this I work on the Texas Gas Trading desk and Brian Redmond asked me to find out what was at the crux of the issue in the article below He is drafting a

in reference to this comes from you so I figured I would go right to the source Please let me know if you can help me out or if you know of someone who can Thank You Bryan Hull PIPELINE RATES WITH WOOD AT THE TABLE POLICY ISSUES KEEP POPPING UP IN CASELOAD Inside FERC Copyright McGrawHill Inc Commissioner Pat Wood III last week again used otherwise routine cases to explore broader policy issues focusing at Wednesdays meeting on discounting operational flow orders and the notion of applying order mandates to intrastate pipelines Wood next turned to whether intrastate pipelines operating under Natural Gas Policy Act section should be required to provide services demanded by order The discussion came up in the context of EPGT Texas Pipeline LP which asked the commission to approve interstate rates for the service it provides on the intrastate pipeline In exchange for not forcing straight fixedvariable rate design down the throat of the pipeline EPGT should be directed to comply with order mandates on capacity release electronic bulletin boards and flexible receipt and delivery points Wood said The point of was to bring the benefits of competitive tools to shippers across the country he said about the pipe which is one of the nations largest systems not under order jurisdiction The line is about miles in length and moves about Bcfday While Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell indicated support for Woods position Breathitt took up the opposition The commissioners have talked about extending the orders reach for some time said Breathitt Still there has been no groundswell for change and for that reason I would not be enthusiastic about an unwarranted expansion of federal authority over issues that should fall under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions By expanding the reach of order to intrastate facilities FERC would be opening Pandoras box Breathitt warned The concept could be extended beyond the three topics mentioned by Wood to cover the orders Gas Industry Standards Board or discounting standards she cautioned In the end such an expansion of federal authority would have the unintended consequence of chilling expansion of intrastate capacity she warned After the short debate the commission declined to open a broader proceeding on Woods proposal and struck the issue from the agenda While insisting his focus was on EPGT Wood before the matter was put aside said we could do it in a generic proceeding Wood also touched on the idea of mandating that EPGT make charitable contributions equal to of its annual revenue Its not bad policy to have them contribute to the community said Wood Breathitt also endorsed the concept saying there is ratepayer benefit to charitable contributions The other commissioners were far less enthusiastic Brownell said the problem with such a mandate is that ratepayers would have no opportunity to comment on the way those contributions are made Ratepayers should be not taxed without a vote she said Hebert and Commissioner William Massey agreed that corporations should make contributions on their own and that the commission should stay clear More generally Hebert explained that his preference is to give deference to state regulators on these matters Lets see if state officials want us to reach into their business Hebert said

and many suggested that the commission should pull together separate but related El Paso proceedings For its part El Paso rebutted a July complaint RP by a group of mostly fullrequirements shippers located east of California The EOC shippers alleged that El Paso was neglecting its responsibilities to existing shippers while concentrating on drumming up new business without needed system upgrades or expansions The shipper group claimed that a year rate freeze running through gives El Paso no incentive to improve its system to maintain service quality IF July The complaint is without foundation in fact law or policy El Paso insisted in an Aug answer The pipeline has consistently maintained facilities or built new capacity whenever it has been economically justifiable under the settlement In the meantime a large and unexpected increase in fullrequirements load has triggered use of a capacityallocation scheme which also was agreed to by parties in the settlement El Paso told FERC Frustration with the capacityallocation methodology was expressed by CD shippers in response to the complaint In representative comments the Indicated Shippers agreed with the EOC shippers that a chronic shortage of capacity exists on El Paso but did not accept the EOC groups version of events that led to the problem or its proposed solution The EOC group asked FERC to direct El Paso to add facilities and dedicate all of the Mcfday of capacity from an ongoing conversion project to existing firm contractual obligations The Indicated Shippers derided the term existing firm obligations as vague enough to cover new power plants and referred to the controversy surrounding El Pasos Redhawk project which FERC recently agreed can be built under automatic blanket authorization to serve two power plants in Maricopa County Ariz To bring certainty to the El Paso system all shipper rights must be better defined the Indicated Shippers demanded in calling for all fullrequirements contracts to be converted to contract demand contracts echoing a similar assertion made in a July complaint by a group of CD shippers RP Otherwise fullrequirements shippers will enjoy unlimited use of capacity at the expense of other customers the Indicated Shippers continued The absurdity of the claim is demonstrated by analogy to a request that an airplane be built to carry all customers who might request service on a particular day without requiring the customers to make a reservation they said The entire ability of El Paso to handle increased volumes systemwide was questioned earlier this summer by Commissioner Pat Wood III in a June discussion prior to the Redhawk vote IF July El Paso was directed to relate in its order proceeding RP how well upstream capacity can handle new load on the system El Paso committed in a July letter to serve fullrequirements customers while satisfying obligations to California customers On days of short supply shippers using primary points are scheduled ahead of those using alternate points and interruptible shippers El Paso went on to say If firm shippers using primary points exceed available capacity then volumes are allocated on a prorata basis El Paso also reiterated its plans to use the capacity from the conversion of the All American Pipeline LP to serve existing customers Beyond requesting the information in the order proceeding FERC should take another step to consider the totality of circumstances on the El Paso system and reopen the pipelines rates under section of the Natural Gas Act Southern California Edison Co asserted The increased load by fullrequirements shippers caused problems in flowing contracted quantities on El Paso SoCal Ed contended Fullrequirements and contract demand shippers pay for service differently SoCal Ed continued While CD shippers pay demand charges for all their volumes fullrequirements shippers pay charges based on total billing determinants of Dtday When FR customers use more than that El Paso is unable to honor firm commitments and the customers enjoy a free ride at the expense of California consumers theutility complained Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Co LP registered a similar concern contending that the prorata allocation methodology favors FR customers Fullrequirements shippers can game the system by nominating volumes far in excess of their actual needs and thus receive disproportionate volumes in the prorata allocation scheme that El Paso uses Oneok said Given that the related complaints deal with the same issue Pacific Gas and Electric Co Enron Corp and El Paso asked FERC to consolidate the cases The cases should be addressed in one hearing where numerous allegations of contested fact could be investigated El Paso submitted But neither shipper group is right the pipeline maintained It insisted that it adheres to the letter of its contracts tariff and two settlements to meet obligations to customers Because unanticipated growth in fullrequirements demand has caused use of the capacity allocation procedures El Paso would like to establish a new systemwide allocation methodology in the order proceeding it told FERC In anticipation that this escalating usage under the FR contracts will come under commission scrutiny the EOC shippers apparently chose to make a preemptive strike El Paso said FERC should consider whether there is a reasonably proportionate limitation implied in El Pasos FR contracts the pipeline continued Fullrequirements shippers cannot demand more and more volumes without paying for it El Paso held It is ludicrous for the EOC shippers to suggest that it is economically justifiable for El Paso to construct expensive mainline facilities costing hundreds of millions of dollars to serve everincreasing FR loads at EL Pasos commodity rates El Paso argued Besides the commission has no authority to force a pipeline to expand under the circumstances at hand El Paso continued Under NGA section a FERCs ability to order a physical connection to a pipeline is limited to service for local distribution El Paso noted Any decision about other pipeline facilities must be left to stockholders and directors of the companies it concluded

El Paso Rests Its Case in Gas Hearing Energy Firm accused of price gouging ends arguments though judge warned theres evidence it manipulated market By RICARDO ALONSOZALDIVAR TIMES STAFF WRITER WASHINGTON A Texas natural gas conglomerate accused of price gouging in California unexpectedly rested its case Monday even though a judge warned that the state has presented credible evidence the company attempted to take unfair advantage of the energy crisis Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said he had wanted El Paso Corp to present witnesses to explain taperecorded phone calls that he says raised suspicions of an inside deal to manipulate Californias natural gas market The California Public Utilities Commission is alleging that El Paso created artificial natural gas shortages last year helping drive electricity prices to record levels The state wants FERC to order refunds of at least million But the company said its critics had not presented any new evidence and had failed to prove their allegations FERCs governing board had initially dismissed complaints of insider dealing but it recently authorized Wagner to take a closer look If anything happens here I am sure it is going to be all political said El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn There is absolutely no new evidence FERC already looked at this the first time and found that El Paso did not violate any rules How can they come back and say we did Kevin Lipson a lawyer for plaintiff Southern California Edison called El Pasos decision one of the dumber moves Ive ever seen valid from a legal standpoint but a public relations disaster The judge is saying were going to have to draw our own conclusions if they dont present witnesses The case is considered the closest thing to a fullblown trial of allegations that corporate schemingnot merely an imbalance of supply and demandcontributed to Californias energy woes At issue is a controversial contract between two subsidiaries of the Houstonbased company El Paso Natural Gas Co a pipeline regulated by FERC and El Paso Merchant Energy an energy marketing company The marketing company last year acquired the right to ship billion cubic feet of natural gas a day through a critical pipeline serving Southern California CPUC alleges that Merchant used inside information to win the deal and later withheld supplies of gas to drive up prices Once the contract expired May and some other companies acquired the shipping rights natural gas prices plunged Wagner FERCs chief administrative law judge has until early October to render an initial decision to the agencys governing board FERC has the power to order the return of any illgotten profits but the company would likely appeal such a penalty to the federal courts A few weeks ago Wagner dismissed Gov Gray Davis demand for billion in electricity refunds from outofstate suppliers In the El Paso case however he has been a thorn in the side of industry El Paso chief executive William Wise had been expected to take the stand Monday afternoon when the company abruptly shifted its strategy in a dramatic legal gambit Dan Collins an El Paso attorney told the judge that the company would rest its case Collins held out the possibility that Wise might yet testify but only to answer questions from the judge not from plaintiffs lawyers After a short recess Wagner returned to the hearing room and ruled that CPUC had met its initial burden of proofakin to finding probable cause in a criminal trial I do find that the complainant has made a prima facie case and the burden of proof now shifts to El Paso Wagner said When El Pasos lawyers tried to respond Wagner ordered them to please be seated Wagner said he was disturbed by transcripts of conversations taped in February between Robin Cox an official of El Paso Merchant and Harvey Rodman an official of yet another El Paso subsidiary Mojave Pipeline Co Cox was seeking a shipping discount from Mojave a few days before Merchant finalized its bid The Mojave pipeline would provide an alternative route into Southern California in case of shipping bottlenecks Securing the Mojave discount made the El Paso contract more valuable for Merchant the plaintiffs allege In one taped conversation Cox asks Rodman to refrain from publicly posting the discount for a few days Plaintiffs allege that other shippers might have competed with Merchant for El Pasos capacity had they known a discount was available on Mojave But Merchant official Mark Mitchell testified that the Mojave discount was of no real importance in the companys decision to enter into the deal The judge wanted to know more He urged El Paso Corp to produce Cox and Rodman as witnesses If ever a deal was being made the words are clear said Wagner Its all buddybuddy stuff The judge said he was concerned that the CoxRodman conversations violated FERC rules that require pipelines to maintain armslength relationships with marketing affiliates CPUC attorney Harvey Morris who has spearheaded the case against El Paso said the judges ruling made it clear that Merchant obtained preferential treatment Morris said he was baffled that El Paso chose not to bring on more witnesses despite the judges warning If I were in their shoes said Morris unless I had something to hide Id call my witnesses and give them another chance to defend themselves Responded William Scherman a lawyer for Merchant You make a judgment that you have produced evidence that is sufficient to win your case and we believe we have done that Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story Copyright Los Angeles Times Price gouging case strong judge says El Paso Corp executives decline to testify hearing cut short Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer Tuesday August San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL A federal regulatory judge buoyed Californias hopes for a major refund on energy costs yesterday when he said the state had presented credible evidence that a giant Texas natural gas company broke the rules against favoring an affiliate Curtis L Wagner the chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said lawyers for the state had made a convincing case that the El Paso Corp acted improperly He urged El Paso executives to rebut the allegations But they declined bringing an unexpectedly sudden end to the evidentiary hearing in Washington DC and boosting the spirits of California officials who have asked the regulatory commission to order El Paso Corp to refund up to million Wagner plans to file a recommended decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Oct At issue is an allegation by the state Public Utilities Commission that El Paso rigged the bidding for use of its natural gas pipeline in Southern California last year The PUC said El Paso steered a huge block of crucial pipeline space to its own marketing affiliate effectively freezing out competitors The PUC utilities say that El Pasos pipeline division and its marketing arm then cooperated to choke off the flow of gas to the state setting off increases in the price of natural gas as well as in the price of electricity from gasfired power plants Wagner said internal El Paso memos and transcripts support the first part of the states allegations that El Paso violated federal regulations that prohibit coordination between regulated natural gas pipelines and their unregulated affiliates which are required to operate independently The California Public Utilities Commission had shown a prima facie case and the burden of proof shifted to the other side Wagner told The Chronicle yesterday Now I have to look at the whole record and decide the case El Paso denies the allegations that it improperly shared information about the bidding process with the marketing affiliate and arranged discounts Top executives including El Paso Corp chief executive officer William Wise had flown to Washington to testify at Wagners suggestion I told them what I thought they needed to do to show there was no affiliate abuse or no market manipulation Wagner said But he said the company had the right to cut the hearing short and rely on the evidence already presented Thats up to them Whatever penalties the commission might impose they could be dwarfed by damages sought in a series of private ratepayer lawsuits against El Paso Those suits claim the company is largely responsible for billions of dollars in skyrocketing energy costs suffered by Californians over the past months AMOUNTS TO CONCESSION The decision to keep executives off the witness stand yesterday amounted to a concession that El Paso violated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations against affiliate abuse asserted PUC attorney Harvey Morris I infer from their actions it was not going to get any better if executives testified Morris said They were doing damage control El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn denied that the company has conceded wrongdoing Thats absolutely insane said Dunn Wagner said transcripts of a telephone conversation between an employee of El Pasos marketing arm El Paso Merchant Energy and one of its pipeline affiliates tend to show there was communication between the marketing agency and the pipeline The two were discussing discounts It looked like hankypanky Wagner said The judge said he was also influenced that a memo outlining El Paso Merchant Energys strategy for boosting profits from its pipeline contract was shared with the top executive for the companys

of the contracts Bernadette Tansey Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday August San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state But in a repeat of the states tactics when it lined up billion in electricity contracts officials wont say how much they have spent so far or how much they plan to buy in the future The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space state officials said But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases Releasing additional details such as the price officials paid would jeopardize the states goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gasfueled power plants that serve California said Ray Hart deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy Hart said they could rush in scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state he said Details of the states gas deals will be made public as much as six months after theyre signed when they no longer give traders any advantage he said That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of Californias power needs for more than a decade If there were a competitive bidding process then yes the price should be secret while its pending said Marcel Hawiger a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network But in a situation like it is now where theyre just negotiating backroom deals we think they should be disclosing everything right away Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the states foray into the natural gas market A DISASTER The governors secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the states longterm power buying effort that he credits with taming the outofcontrol electricity market in California His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt The states new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under longterm contracts with the state dont hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts if the power plants dont make lowcost deals for gas the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss Hart said If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state he said Harts agency signed a fouryear million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm Interstate Gas Services The firm was authorized in July to make shortterm gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California STRATEGY QUESTIONED Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late Bill Marcus a TURN energy consultant said the states high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases Ron Low a PGE spokesman said state gas cost overestimates would add million to consumers bills statewide through about million would be paid by PGE customers Hart scoffed at PGEs claims For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous Hart said Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts he said But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future Youre going to see prices go up again Mark Allen Bernstein an analyst with RAND said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations he said The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month water department officials said It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from outofstate producing basins Hart said Hart said critics of the states electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas Hart said the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring We got totally hammered by the media for those variable contracts Hart said My God were saving billions of dollars Email the reporters at mailto and mailto San Francisco Chronicle Page A

the mechanics If you remember we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the email message below Since then FERC has issued orders in Docket No RP on and which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted namely if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PGE market and the original shipper wants it back it can rerecall the recalled capacity on hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity If you need something more legal well see what we can do If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion there would be a charge since theyd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one From Rebecca W Cantrell PM To Stephanie NRON cc Subject Re block II I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock The order should have taken care of it except for El Pasos position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they werent overselling it Order Date Block II Rulings Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of order Order on Rehearing Enron Clarifies the January order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PGE turnback capacity including Block II for primary delivery to delivery points other than PGE Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions Enron Williams Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PGE Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal see and orders and provide that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PGE Topock and if so recalled it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PGE service territory upon hours notice Clarifies as in Dynegy that the shipper Enron must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first Order on Rehearing and Clarification Dynegy Denies rehearing of order Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing Dynegy Affirms that PGE and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract to Dynegy Reverses previous ruling does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled Per Settlement recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less If for more than one month the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper On hours notice the existing shipper ie Dynegy may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California Dynegy may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it Letter Order on Compliance Filing Requires the DynegyEl Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled issue is markets served not delivery points Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by Dynegy Block II is recallable if Dynegy is using it to serve end users not within PGEs service territory Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PGEs service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper Original Message From Miller Stephanie Sent Friday August AM To Cantrell Rebecca W Lawner Leslie Cc Tycholiz Barry Subject Block III Recall Rights Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PGEs northern CA customers recall rights on Block III capacity While it was not part of the original settlement the hour RErecall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PGE a DAILY call on capacity at best Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings we would like a more formal regulatorylegal opinion of the mechanics of the RErecall provision that has been developed over time Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG By the way

<22104407.1075861469868.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,w..cantrell@enron.com,2001-09-24 08:41:50,FYI in case you havent see this yet PLAYING AN UNUSUAL ROLE LANGDON PICKS THROUGH EL PASO RECORD Handed the unusual task of independently assessing the strength of El Paso Corps defense in the California capacity complaint case Washington attorney Jim Langdon for weeks has been searching for relevant issues that may have been ignored or overlooked by the litigants And he thinks he may have stumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the critical months of the California energy crisis What Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case RP the California Public Utilities Commission may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during the months of the controversial largevolume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co and affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co Langdon a partner in the Washington office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP in late July was hired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the record in the case IF Aug The idea was not to secondguess the lawyers litigating the case but rather to think dispassionately about the events of last year and give Wise an independent view of the behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the month contract for Bcfday of capacity to California Langdon explained last week Wises decision to hire Langdon was eyecatching on a few levels In his many years in law practice Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for Langdon told Inside FERC acknowledging this really was a little bit of an unusual request Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdons substantial administration connections He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon who as a FERC commissioner in the early s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition and the possibility that he may have some positive collateral impact on the commissions ultimate decision in this case That possibility didnt escape me at the time Langdon admitted Ill not pretend to be unaware that there are these other connections with Wood and the president he allowed adding that thats something that impacts everything I do But what can I do I have to practice law And for the record I barely know Pat Wood And how can this be considered an independent thirdparty assessment if El Paso is paying for Langdons services I recognize that there are critics and cynics who would suggest that Langdon is simply a hired gun but at the end of the day Ill have to stand behind the report He vowed to call it the way I see it His final report to Wise wont be ready for several weeks but Langdon shared some of his initial thoughts and findings Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern California Gas Co storage facilities the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County During the period that roughly coincides with the El PasoEl Paso Merchant contract SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large volumes of storage gas from those fields said Langdon The state commission finally granted the requests in June the month after termination of the contract he related Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso Canyon and La Goleta fields an aggregate total of Bcf would have contributed more than Dtday of deliverability to the California gas market without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity said Langdon Characterizing California as a culdesac on the interstate pipeline network he stressed that storage is huge in moderating the market When pipeline capacity is constrained storage is a way to take care of these problems And yet the SoCal Gas applications clearly languished at the CPUC There may be very good reasons why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas but so far I dont understand how the CPUC sits on a storage application like that during this time period when its as significant as it is For its part the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its feet in developing the Line conversion project IF May Im trying not to sound like an advocate in this thing said Langdon but I dont understand the CPUCs position in the case when right in their own back yard theyve got these storage issues As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the contract and subsequently withheld massive amounts of capacity from the market weve reached the conclusion that we dont see that kind of evidence in whats been presented so far in the proceeding said Langdon His team of lawyers is looking closely at the maze of engineering issues that could hold the answer to the capacity withholding issue Langdon all but dismissed the affiliateabuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving energy market Order the marketingaffiliate rule was first promulgated in he noted In most industries such conflictofinterest rules are constantly revised to keep pace But here the gas industry has been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of and yet these rules are the very same ones that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly years They absolutely need to be updated end of sentence end of paragraph said Langdon Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr about the strength of the El Paso case Langdon said he was not at all concerned about the company not getting a fair shake at the commission Much of what Wagner had to say has been sensationalized to a degree in the press he said adding that what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are two different things Langdon admitted that he would be a little concerned about Wagners remarks if I were litigating the case The judge has used some pretty strong language to suggest that the El Paso companies were out of line But FERC historically has been a very recordoriented tribunal and in this case the record looks very sound he said Chris Newkumet

Companies Inc Reproduction forbidden without permission BLAMING EACH OTHER EL PASO SHIPPERS CALL FOR ALLOCATION OVERHAUL Contract demand shippers last week argued anew that insufficient physical capacity exists on the El Paso Natural Gas Co system and that fullrequirement shippers often are to blame for system disruptions on peak days In comments various El Paso shippers called on FERC to address their concerns and many suggested that the commission should pull together separate but related El Paso proceedings For its part El Paso rebutted a July complaint RP by a group of mostly fullrequirements shippers located east of California The EOC shippers alleged that El Paso was neglecting its responsibilities to existing shippers while concentrating on drumming up new business without needed system upgrades or expansions The shipper group claimed that a year rate freeze running through gives El Paso no incentive to improve its system to maintain service quality IF July The complaint is without foundation in fact law or policy El Paso insisted in an Aug answer The pipeline has consistently maintained facilities or built new capacity whenever it has been economically justifiable under the settlement In the meantime a large and unexpected increase in fullrequirements load has triggered use of a capacityallocation scheme which also was agreed to by parties in the settlement El Paso told FERC Frustration with the capacityallocation methodology was expressed by CD shippers in response to the complaint In representative comments the Indicated Shippers agreed with the EOC shippers that a chronic shortage of capacity exists on El Paso but did not accept the EOC groups version of events that led to the problem or its proposed solution The EOC group asked FERC to direct El Paso to add facilities and dedicate all of the Mcfday of capacity from an ongoing conversion project to existing firm contractual obligations The Indicated Shippers derided the term existing firm obligations as vague enough to cover new power plants and referred to the controversy surrounding El Pasos Redhawk project which FERC recently agreed can be built under automatic blanket authorization to serve two power plants in Maricopa County Ariz To bring certainty to the El Paso system all shipper rights must be better defined the Indicated Shippers demanded in calling for all fullrequirements contracts to be converted to contract demand contracts echoing a similar assertion made in a July complaint by a group of CD shippers RP Otherwise fullrequirements shippers will enjoy unlimited use of capacity at the expense of other customers the Indicated Shippers continued The absurdity of the claim is demonstrated by analogy to a request that an airplane be built to carry all customers who might request service on a particular day without requiring the customers to make a reservation they said The entire ability of El Paso to handle increased volumes systemwide was questioned earlier this summer by Commissioner Pat Wood III in a June discussion prior to the Redhawk vote IF July El Paso was directed to relate in its order proceeding RP how well upstream capacity can handle new load on the system El Paso committed in a July letter to serve fullrequirements customers while satisfying obligations to California customers On days of short supply shippers using primary points are scheduled ahead of those using alternate points and interruptible shippers El Paso went on to say If firm shippers using primary points exceed available capacity then volumes are allocated on a prorata basis El Paso also reiterated its plans to use the capacity from the conversion of the All American Pipeline LP to serve existing customers Beyond requesting the information in the order proceeding FERC should take another step to consider the totality of circumstances on the El Paso system and reopen the pipelines rates under section of the Natural Gas Act Southern California Edison Co asserted The increased load by fullrequirements shippers caused problems in flowing contracted quantities on El Paso SoCal Ed contended Fullrequirements and contract demand shippers pay for service differently SoCal Ed continued While CD shippers pay demand charges for all their volumes fullrequirements shippers pay charges based on total billing determinants of Dtday When FR customers use more than that El Paso is unable to honor firm commitments and the customers enjoy a free ride at the expense of California consumers theutility complained Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Co LP registered a similar concern contending that the prorata allocation methodology favors FR customers Fullrequirements shippers can game the system by nominating volumes far in excess of their actual needs and thus receive disproportionate volumes in the prorata allocation scheme that El Paso uses Oneok said Given that the related complaints deal with the same issue Pacific Gas and Electric Co Enron Corp and El Paso asked FERC to consolidate the cases The cases should be addressed in one hearing where numerous allegations of contested fact could be investigated El Paso submitted But neither shipper group is right the pipeline maintained It insisted that it adheres to the letter of its contracts tariff and two settlements to meet obligations to customers Because unanticipated growth in fullrequirements demand has caused use of the capacity allocation procedures El Paso would like to establish a new systemwide allocation methodology in the order proceeding it told FERC In anticipation that this escalating usage under the FR contracts will come under commission scrutiny the EOC shippers apparently chose to make a preemptive strike El Paso said FERC should consider whether there is a reasonably proportionate limitation implied in El Pasos FR contracts the pipeline continued Fullrequirements shippers cannot demand more and more volumes without paying for it El Paso held It is ludicrous for the EOC shippers to suggest that it is economically justifiable for El Paso to construct expensive mainline facilities costing hundreds of millions of dollars to serve everincreasing FR loads at EL Pasos commodity rates El Paso argued Besides the commission has no authority to force a pipeline to expand under the circumstances at hand El Paso continued Under NGA section a FERCs ability to order a physical connection to a pipeline is limited to service for local distribution El Paso noted Any decision about other pipeline facilities must be left to stockholders and directors of the companies it concluded

published August CA Gas Reporting Order Sparks Rehearing Requests While many marketers are complaining to FERC that its drastic order Imposing Reporting Requirements on Natural Gas Sales to California Market is not needed or oversteps its jurisdiction state utilities and regulators would like to see the order expanded and the results shared The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued the July order in an attempt to understand why natural gas prices rose considerably more in California when compared to the rest of the country see Daily GPI July The adopted gas sales reporting requirements will cover gas sellers local distribution companies LDC and transporters serving the California market In its ruling FERC said it plans to collect the data on a quarterly basis days after the end of a quarter in a standardized format and then aggregate it to assess whether any action is warranted with respect to the gas prices in the state Two of the petitioners Enron North America and Enron Energy Services said among other things in their request for a rehearing that the price anomaly of last winter was a transitory problem with solutions already in sight at least at the federal level The companies added that prices are continuing to fall over time and thus there is no reason for the Commission to require the permanent reporting rules that were included in the order The Enron companies said they support the continuation of ad hoc reports that the Commission already has requested from certain parties They said that while they prefer the reports more than the reporting requirements that contain no sunset date they believe that the formalized adoption of these reports is not appropriate for the situation imposes undue burden on affected companies and in light of market changes is no longer justified ePrime Inc a gas marketing subsidiary of Xcel Energy and Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc TEMI also filed motions for rehearing based upon claims that they do not fall under the Commissions Natural Gas Act NGA jurisdiction TEMI claims that although it is a marketer of natural gas and electricity the Commission has erred in ordering that the reporting requirement may apply to companies that are not jurisdictional for purposes of the NGA and related statutes TEMI further stated in its request that if the Commission continues to find that the gas reporting requirement may be applied to such companies it should have refrained from doing so with respect to entities whose volumes of gas sales are clearly not material to the Commissions core inquiry ePrimes request stated that neither Section nor Section of the NGA empowers FERC to require nonjurisdictional companies to report The Commission has no authority to compel nonjurisdictional entities to report any information regarding nonjurisdictional transactions to the Commission ePrime stated in its request ePrime said the Commission noted that its jurisdiction to regulate prices charged by natural gas sellers is limited to sales for resale of domestic gas by pipelines LDCs or their affiliates Furthermore the marketer said that the information demanded by FERC is highly confidential with sensitive marketing information which even with regards to jurisdictional entities cannot be required ePrime said to do so could jeopardize the potential release of sensitive trading information which serves no useful regulatory purpose Not every company was seeking to have the order tamed however Southern California Gas Co San Diego Gas Electric Co collectively Sempra utilities and the California Public Utilities Commission all would like it expanded The Sempra utilities filed a request of limited clarification with the Commission regarding the orders scope The utilities requested that the Commission clarify that it intends for interstate pipelines serving California to provide data on capacity utilization by shippers east and north upstream of California in addition to data regarding capacity utilization by shippers directly serving the state The request for clarification requests that upstream entities such as LDCs and utilities also be included in the reporting requirements The Sempra utilities stated that since activity upstream of California affects deliveries to and prices at the California border it is essential that the Commission obtain the same data from these entities as it would for California LDCs utilities and marketing affiliates Absent this information it is impossible for the Commission to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pricing disparity between California and the rest of the nation In the CPUCs request for a rehearing and clarification it is requesting again that the Commission share the information with the CPUC The CPUC argued that information explaining how the exceptionally high California border price of gas in and occurred could aid the state in understanding how it happened and how to spot the indicators in the future The organization said it would maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive material under the FERCs rules as it does under its own rules for confidential information

Index published August Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourserate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates Mary Kay Miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd that subsequently entered into negotiatedrate transactions But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted Even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said Miller Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern were null and void The only relevant ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan she noted Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its preposting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiatedrate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as MMBtu last February far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of centsMMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiatedrate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total MMBtud of service on Transwestern during February and March Richardson and Sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony The two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern Richardson or Sempra she noted Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E Sullivan to the contrary Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates Miller testified Sullivan an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets Tariffs and Rates OMTR Division of Litigation contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates see Daily GPI Aug subscribersdailynewsdehtml In fact he believes the preposting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiatedrate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available But Miller counters that Sullivan offers not support for his claim She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson in response to a data request by Southern California Edison support Transwesterns claims Both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate The capacity at issue was offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including Richardson or Sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate Sullivan contends that Transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiatedrate transactions at the expense of recourserate deals was pure profit Under questioning by Thomas J Burgess of FERCs OMTR Miller conceded that Transwestern earned million from Sempra Energys contract in March million from Richardsons March contract and a comparable amount from Richardsons February contract She noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of Sempras February contract but she didnt provide an exact figure FERCs Sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the Sempra February contract was more than million Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwesterns coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates But Miller countered that the Commissions negotiatedrate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits Furthermore she said the Transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiatedrate policy as Sullivan has suggested This case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiatedrate policy should only be done on an industrywide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged

RECORD Handed the unusual task of independently assessing the strength of El Paso Corps defense in the California capacity complaint case Washington attorney Jim Langdon for weeks has been searching for relevant issues that may have been ignored or overlooked by the litigants And he thinks he may have stumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the critical months of the California energy crisis What Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case RP the California Public Utilities Commission may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during the months of the controversial largevolume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co and affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co Langdon a partner in the Washington office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP in late July was hired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the record in the case IF Aug The idea was not to secondguess the lawyers litigating the case but rather to think dispassionately about the events of last year and give Wise an independent view of the behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the month contract for Bcfday of capacity to California Langdon explained last week Wises decision to hire Langdon was eyecatching on a few levels In his many years in law practice Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for Langdon told Inside FERC acknowledging this really was a little bit of an unusual request Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdons substantial administration connections He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon who as a FERC commissioner in the early s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition and the possibility that he may have some positive collateral impact on the commissions ultimate decision in this case That possibility didnt escape me at the time Langdon admitted Ill not pretend to be unaware that there are these other connections with Wood and the president he allowed adding that thats something that impacts everything I do But what can I do I have to practice law And for the record I barely know Pat Wood And how can this be considered an independent thirdparty assessment if El Paso is paying for Langdons services I recognize that there are critics and cynics who would suggest that Langdon is simply a hired gun but at the end of the day Ill have to stand behind the report He vowed to call it the way I see it His final report to Wise wont be ready for several weeks but Langdon shared some of his initial thoughts and findings Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern California Gas Co storage facilities the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County During the period that roughly coincides with the El PasoEl Paso Merchant contract SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large volumes of storage gas from those fields said Langdon The state commission finally granted the requests in June the month after termination of the contract he related Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso Canyon and La Goleta fields an aggregate total of Bcf would have contributed more than Dtday of deliverability to the California gas market without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity said Langdon Characterizing California as a culdesac on the interstate pipeline network he stressed that storage is huge in moderating the market When pipeline capacity is constrained storage is a way to take care of these problems And yet the SoCal Gas applications clearly languished at the CPUC There may be very good reasons why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas but so far I dont understand how the CPUC sits on a storage application like that during this time period when its as significant as it is For its part the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its feet in developing the Line conversion project IF May Im trying not to sound like an advocate in this thing said Langdon but I dont understand the CPUCs position in the case when right in their own back yard theyve got these storage issues As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the contract and subsequently withheld massive amounts of capacity from the market weve reached the conclusion that we dont see that kind of evidence in whats been presented so far in the proceeding said Langdon His team of lawyers is looking closely at the maze of engineering issues that could hold the answer to the capacity withholding issue Langdon all but dismissed the affiliateabuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving energy market Order the marketingaffiliate rule was first promulgated in he noted In most industries such conflictofinterest rules are constantly revised to keep pace But here the gas industry has been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of and yet these rules are the very same ones that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly years They absolutely need to be updated end of sentence end of paragraph said Langdon Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr about the strength of the El Paso case Langdon said he was not at all concerned about the company not getting a fair shake at the commission Much of what Wagner had to say has been sensationalized to a degree in the press he said adding that what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are two different things Langdon admitted that he would be a little concerned about Wagners remarks if I were litigating the case The judge has used some pretty strong language to suggest that the El Paso companies were out of line But FERC historically has been a very recordoriented tribunal and in this case the record looks very sound he said Chris Newkumet
