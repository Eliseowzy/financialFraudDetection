<7860670.1075860836065.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stephen.perich@enron.com,2001-11-27 12:39:13,Employee MoraleMr Lay My name is Stephen Perich and I am an analyst working in Gas Trading I just wanted to write you and give you an update on the mood here on the fl oor which I expect can be found throughout the company given the current s ituation Although we continue to work and perform our jobs I have been h earing some comments that suggest some people might be giving up When sma ll problems arise one can hear Dont worry about it it doesnt matter n ow anyway That kind of attitude at this time is detrimental what we sho uld be seeing is extra effort to try and reverse the situation I would never presume to know how a CEO should act in these circumstance s In fact I know that you must have a good idea how to handle these situ ations or you would not be the leader of this great company However I d o know that you are still our leader and we look to you and trust you to d o your best I have faith that you are doing your best and I can imagine how difficult your job is right now But I think there are some who might be starting to question managements decisions and even if those decisions are contingent upon a concern for the employees interests I think this can be solved through one of our core values COMMUNICATION I am sure tha t whatever is going on right now is speculative and that no one is sure of anything and that is exactly what we are hearing from CNBC But I dont t hink that the employees want to hear it from CNBC they would like to hear it from their leader Even if nothing is concrete you have no definitive answers and you really have no idea what is going to happen just send us an email saying I know you are all on edge about what is going on but ri ght now I have nothing concrete to report I have no definitive answers an d I really dont have any idea what will happen but I will let you know as soon as I do I cant emphasize how much it would mean for the employees to hear that I also would like to thank you for your hard work I can imagine you are enduring stress which none of us are familiar with But please remember t hat you are CEO for a reason be confident in your abilities and in those o f you subordinates and continue to work hard Thanks again and good luck Sincerely SP
