soon Im sure Love Robs Original Message From Bob Knight To Tosha Knight Todd Cluxton Joe Knight Pat Knight Debbie Knight Sent Monday September PM Subject Fw article is by an AfghanAmerican Original Message From esourceDynamicscom To Kurt W Altergott Colleen Cronin Norman Dahl angela fain John Fernandes Bob Knight Commander Julie Julie ATcom Sent Monday September AM Subject article is by an AfghanAmerican FYI this article is by an AfghanAmerican who has lived in the San Francisco Bay area for years Its something to think about deeply as we determine how to deal with the horrific provocations of last week which may well have been designed to get up our collective blood lust such that we play right into the perpetrators hands We must ask what are their broader aims beyond showing us the depth of their hatred How can they best be thwarted Edmund Burke said the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing As we figure out what is to be done we must show not only that we are stronger but also wiser than these monsters who would destroy civilization as we know it An AfghanAmerican speaks You cant bomb us back into the Stone Age Were already there But you can start a new world war and thats exactly what Osama bin Laden wants By Tamim Ansary Sept Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on San Franciscos KGO Talk Radio conceded today that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived in the United States for years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and bin Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitatedsuffering A few years agothe United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistan a country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and healthcare Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban by raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what Thats bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the West It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the West wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the West would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else About the writer Tamim Ansary is a writer in San Francisco and the son of a former Afghani politician Thank You Norm

Subject FW please read Original Message From Roxann Neumann mailto Sent Thursday September AM To Neumann Roxann Subject FW please read Re THE GREAT AMERICAN STOCK REVIVAL Americas blood banks are overflowing with people who want to help America in this time of crisis So many are volunteering to donate blood that some donors are being turned away But there is a way that you can make a difference You can fight terrorism help America get back on its feet and memorialize those who died BUY STOCK WHEN THE STOCK MARKET REOPENS AND HOLD IT If everyone bought just one hundred shares we could make Americas stock market soar Many of those who died in the World Trade Center made their living financing the American dream They created and traded stock in American companies If you buy stock when the markets reopen you will show the terrorists that their attack failed to destroy America you will help our economy spring back to life and you will honor the profession of many who died Please reproduce and distribute this message in its entirety to all email addresses that you have Contact radio talk show hosts and other media and ask them to support this event These terrorists are antimind and thus anticapitalism Fight back by using your mind exercising your freedom and buying stock in America Original Message From Roxann Neumann mailto Sent Wednesday September PM To Neumann Roxann Subject FW please read A great idea Please read pass on say a prayer and show your support for our great Country Subject Fw please read An attack took place on our nation and way of life Tuesday The main goal of a terrorist to to disrupt the very fabric of our society and the confidence in our nation Well guess what America doesnt take this kind of thing laying down And we want to make sure all the cowards of the world are aware of it So I ask all of you to do one thing If you do not own an American Flag go buy one TODAY and proudly display it outside If you have one stop what you are doing now and go display it This small show of solidarity on your part demonstrates a united people who WILL NOT be dictated to by the likes of those who seek to disrupt our way of life Our thoughts are with those directly affected by this tragedy Let the next story you and the perpetrators hear on CNN is how every retail outlet in the country is absolutely sold out of American Flags Other things you can do to show support Give blood sometime this week The blood supply is really low right now and we can never have too much Spend some money A strong American economy makes them madder than anything The price of liberty is eternal vigilance Thomas Jefferson Get more from the Web FREE MSN Explorer download
