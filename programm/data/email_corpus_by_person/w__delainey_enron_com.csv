What are those opportunities In short to date no competitor has taken En rons dominant market position In most cases competitiors are retrenchin g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets Market liquidity an d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from levels This will create opportunities as bidoffers expand and customers have less choices to manage key longterm risks This lack of transparancy and liqui dity will also provide numerous opportunities in the commodity asset and capital markets to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri can grid We are faced with an energy asset overhang in the short run w hich is unprecedented since the early nineties This coupled with market p articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value However in th e longrun as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive technology investment resumes increasing asset values demand for energy a nd energy price volatility are highly likely On the services side there a re numerous unmet needs in the market place at this point including demand side management distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible I also be lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets In short we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has not been seen since the early nineties What is NewCo NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun ities detailed above These businesses will stretch from production to mar ket wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t he United States and Canada It will be a portfolio of several key business es services and assets supported by a common infrastructure It will be m ajority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensu re liquidity and legitimacy It will be rebranded and be operating and sol vent by mid Q at the latest It will be seeded with a number of Enron ass ets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key cr edit support Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately million to one billion With asset and new cash investment NewCo should be at least a billion dollar company It will emerge as a nondebtor company and should be an investment grade rated company NewCo will employ approxim ately to people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under control These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in Enron and exemployees NewCo will have access to all Enrons existing sys tems and infrastructure It will be in the market of buying and selling ene rgy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the noncompete with NetcoI would expect that we would have a strong business and transac tional relationship with Netco What will be NewCos culture It will have the benefits of being a small pr ivate company which will measure success by cashflow generation It will b e a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other It will be a group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objec tives It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily for long term value creation We will build an organization of integrity of which people can be proud It will center its objectives around our cust omers and the satisfying unmet needs in the market NewCo will value cust omer relationships It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of o pen communication NewCo will be innovative agile and nimble What is next There will be a meeting in C at PM on Monday to discu ss

steps What are those opportunities In short to date no competitor has taken En rons dominant market position In most cases competitiors are retrenchin g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets Market liquidity an d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from levels This will create opportunities as bidoffers expand and customers have less choices to manage key longterm risks This lack of transparancy and liqui dity will also provide numerous opportunities in the commodity asset and capital markets to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri can grid We are faced with an energy asset overhang in the short run w hich is unprecedented since the early nineties This coupled with market p articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value However in th e longrun as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive technology investment resumes increasing asset values demand for energy a nd energy price volatility are highly likely On the services side there a re numerous unmet needs in the market place at this point including demand side management distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo ple have the complete value chain understanding to
