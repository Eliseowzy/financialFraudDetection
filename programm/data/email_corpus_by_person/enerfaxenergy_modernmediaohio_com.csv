shifts from Republicans to Democrats in the Senate there is a continued battle over price controls The FERC which has authority to cap prices also opposes them Republicans without more support simply ran out of time to help California which faces many hours of blackouts this summer The proposed legislation would have also waived some clean air regulations to allow power plants to operate during peak times relieved transmission congestion with new lines and forced the federal government to cut energy use in its California offices The billwriting session collapsed after California Rep Waxman

PUC Delay Pushes SCE Toward Bankruptcy A delay by the California PUC in implementing parts of a statesponsored billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison may lead the utility into bankruptcy

to Williams Energy Marketing and Trading saying that while Williams controls less than of the generation resources in the state it is still able to exercise market power To renew its marketbased rate authority Williams should perform an analysis of market power using other means the utilities said Massey says the events of the California wholesale power market where no single power seller holds

maintaining the requirement is illegal and inappropriate The ISO faced a June st deadline to file a RTO plan or risk losing FERCbacked emergency price controls The ISO claims that it is not legal or appropriate to condition price controls on anything So far there are RTOs planned for the western US RTO West is mostly based in the Pacific Northwest and Desert Star mainly consists of Southwest utilities FERC would like to see just one RTO in the western region The filing called for the ISO itself to become a third western RTO a move that would appear to make little practical difference to the running of the agency FERC Chairman Hebert has said it was necessary to require California to join at RTO claiming no price relief plan could open clogged transmission systems and build new infrastructure The FERCs price relief plan which is only imposed during pe ri ods when the ISO has declared a power emergency requires generators to offer available electricity in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid New Horizons Solutions for the st

Energy Plan on Collision Course The energy agenda of the new Democraticcontrolled Senate is about to clash with the Bush administration on electricity price caps for California drilling in Alaskan and soaring gasoline prices While President Bush favors more drilling and coal use as part of a national energy policy many Democrats prefer increased conservation and stricter mileage standards for vehicles to save fuel Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has already been declared dead by new Senate Majority Leader Daschle Democratic lawmakers are expected to push for higher gasoline mileage for sports utility vehicles as part of the solution The National Academy of Sciences is due to issue a report in July on possible higher vehicle fuel standards The administration has said it will wait for that report before deciding what to do with current fuel requirements Currently US autos must average miles per gallon but light trucks vans and sport utility vehicles are required to avera ge miles per gallon The US market uses about million barrels per day The biggest fight with the administration is expected to come over the issue of price caps on power sales in California As

of their salaries The bonus plan has been fiercely criticized by consumer groups but has been provisionally approved by creditors Some of the payments outlined in the bonus plan are linked to PGE filing a Chapter reorganization plan no later than January a move the utility was already prepared to do The willingness on the part of the creditors to pay the ransom is presumably tied to their belief that bankruptcy proceedings will be much quicker and smoother if they are not delayed by threatened departures and replacements Its not a question of whether they are bad managers but simply one of expediency The bonus plan follows a much bigger million round of bonuses handed out to employees just days before the utility sought bankruptcy protection i n April GET REAL about energy risk
