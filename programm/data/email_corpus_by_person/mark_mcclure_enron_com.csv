change All name changes will be still attached to the original path of the BuySell deal The Settlement Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the deal has the

Consent to Assignment FYI This change went in for the Deal Validation group It gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back Impact to Logistics Unify If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets which are not in production yetEDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month cant remember the rules on this one but I think Unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force repathing Unify does have the ability to override duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response What are if any impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods repathing I have a call into Diane and Dave both After speaking w them hopefully I can get a clear understanding of the true impact I am sure well need to put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when these type of changes are needed Will keep you posted Thanks dg From Thomas Engel AM To Kathryn CT Dana NRON Elizabeth L CT Julie

CT Donna CT Subject Sitara Release Re Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with confirmed volumes Toms words of caution If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however I did add a warning message Warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback I assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems preUNIFY Some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal Before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline Sorry I dont know which pipes these are you will have to ask the UNIFY team There is one rule still in place you can change from ENAIM East to ENAIM Market East but not from ENAIM Texas to HPLCIM HPLC when changing business units they must be the same legal entity Warning not the same legal entity Also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals Transport Capacity Storage Cash Out Once the deal is invalidated there are no rules Dont forget the items were locked down for a reason If you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in UNIFY it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted Always check with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in UNIFY Forwarded by Thomas EngelHOUECT on AM From Scott Mills on PM To Kathryn CT Dana NRON Elizabeth

release that was put out Tuesday evening Deal Validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected eg confirmed nominated scheduled etc In addition this release will also capture neartime the contract changes that are made in global This means that need for server bounces will not be necessary NewChanges to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager New Counterparties and newchanges to facilities will require getting out of all active Sitara apps except for launch pad Once out of all apps start a new app the respective information that you are looking for will appear I mention neartime because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara
