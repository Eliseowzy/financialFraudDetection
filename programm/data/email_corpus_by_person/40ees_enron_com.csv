that suggests that t here is a relationship between EFS buying the existing projects under the G SA contract and a potential adverse affect on the GSA commodity portion of the commodity risk book This is not the case The potential adverse affe ct on the commodity risk book would exist regardless of whether or not EFS bought the projects That is if there were no change to the internal stru cture of the contract and EES went forward as if nothing had happened then the issue of this potential adverse affect would still exist It would ex ist as an internal EES problem which would have to be resolved because we h ave an existing contract with the VA This commodity risk issue would not exist only if we were going to terminate all the VA projects But as far as I know there has never been serious consideration to terminating the pr ojectsif for no other reason we have no right to unilaterally terminate Only the government has that right The important point here is that this issue is not an issue pertinent to th e indemnification issue Whatever needs to be done to complete the indemni fication process should proceed uninterrupted Once the indemnification ha s been resolved then as a separate matter EES and EFS should address what affect the projects have on the commodity book They are separate issues and would have to be resolved independent of any indemnification issue Bottom line is that by relating the two issues ie the issue of the proje cts affect on the commodity book with the issue of indemnification someo ne has created unnecessary confusion Just thought Id add my two cents Bill Forwarded by Bill HatchHOUEES on PM FromRichard nronXgate on AM CDT ToBill ES cc SubjectFW GSA Region Projects Transition Bill FYI Original Message From Ring Richard SentWednesday October AM ToHerndon Rogers SubjectRE GSA Region Projects Transition Rogers Enron Energy Services Operations Inc EESO and General Services Admini stration GSA entered into an agreement effective November whi ch provides for commodity pricing and value added services specifically re lated to GSA Region New England and runs through October EESO agreed to provide a Discount to Standard Offer commodity price for GSAs Core Load associated with facilities in Massachusetts New Hampshire and Rhode Island at such time as the utilities met certain conditions regardin g deregulation State commission formally approves UDCs restructuring plan and State Commission formally approves the UDCs sale of nonnuclear gener ating assets Individual agencies that have elected to participate under the GSA agreement are Veterans Administration Coast Guard National Parks Service Internal Revenue Service Department of Agriculture National Arc hives and Records Administration Hanscom Air Force Base and Department of Labor with the total core group consisting of approximately MWs The UDCs that have met the above referenced criteria above are Massachusetts UDCs MECO BECO WMECO Fitchburg Gas Electric Eastern Utilities and C ommonwealth Electric Cambridge Electric Company and Rhode Island UDC Nar ragansett Electric The only location where EESO currently delivers physi cal commodity is Massachusetts BECO which represent approximately fifty percent of the total Core Load or approximately MWs and commenced in October The agreement has provided other commodity upsell opportunities such as i physical delivery of comodity GSA accounts and Coast Guard accounts in Mai ne behind Central Maine Power June thru October and ii sale and delivery of renewable energy to GSA and Hanscom Air Force Base Octob er thru December with opportunity to extend thru October Value Added Services under the agreement has been responsible for i solar panel project development and installation ii cogeneration project devel opment and installation in progress iii chilled water project and iv maintenance agreement all which total additional million dollars E ESO had asked GSA to allow the contract to be split between commodity and v alue added services and GSA refused A decision was made that would allow E nron Facilities Services EFS to perform the value added services portion of the contract on behalf of EESO To the best of my knowledge the cogene ration projects would affect only the Veterans Administration sites behind MassachusettsBECO only There is another issue that we can discuss at your convenience which relvol ves around the Master Subcontracting Plan and the requirement in the last two years of the agreement for EESO to spend million each year of the las t two years of the agreement utilizing small business concerns small disad vantaged business concerns and womenowned small business concerns Let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above referenced
