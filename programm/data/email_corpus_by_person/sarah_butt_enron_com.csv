question When does the tariff require the LC to be renewed Do we have some time to wait until midDecember Also attached to this email is Lori Poffenroths November memo which sets forth Loris calculations based on WSPPPAs formulas set forth in their tariffs for Initial Amounts Revised Amounts Recommended October Amounts and Estimated December Amounts All of the WSPs and the PPAs Prudential Requirements allow the WSPs and the PPA to reevaluate EDCCs credit limit andor request additional security from time to time While the following sets out in more detail the manner in which each WSP and the PPA can do this all of the Prudential Requirements are the same in the following two respects if at any time EDCCs financial obligations to the WSPPPA the Financial Obligations exceed the existing credit limit or a certain percentage thereof the WSPPPA has the right to request additional security the Additional Security and if EDCC fails to post the Additional Security within the requisite time period the WSPPPA reserves the right to suspend service to EDCC Note that as of today no WSPPPA has requested Additional Security However as soon as possible the following needs to occur in those instances where the October Amount exceeds the Existing Amount we should post the Additional Security now or we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the Additional Security within the requisite time period Consequently we do have some time to wait until midDecember provided that has occurred As at December we must post the December Amount ATCO Existing Amount Recommended
