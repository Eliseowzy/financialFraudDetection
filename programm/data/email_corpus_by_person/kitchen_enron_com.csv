<454133.1075858462059.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kitchen@enron.com,2001-05-22 11:13:24,Re Wharton Cc attended parts of a day long event which I believe Vince is hosting on Wharton and a project they are doing for us I personally would like to see the results of that before doing more with Wharton as overall Vince and Jeff Shankman have Wharton pretty well covered Louise Christie Patrick PM To Louise CT Greg CT Andy nronXGate cc Jeffrey A nronXGate Vince J nronXGate Mark NRON Subject Wharton Guys First of all Louise I understand we have a baby CONGRATULATIONS details please at your earliest chance Regarding the Wharton eBusiness Initiative see below for one of the many eMails Ive received concerning Enrons participationlink to the referenced web site for specific agenda also Ive received several voice messages from leaders of the effort The information below discusses one of the forums coming up that comprise an ongoing ebusiness initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton The participants from Wharton include senior level professors while there may be some student involvement the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research Again this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side and high level eBusiness Corporate executives on the other side This is intentionally designed to create a highlevel ethinktank environment for senior level professors and corporate executives OKhave I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enrons favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting this is intentionally a researchdiscussion effort Clearly the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings references course work etc A few weeks ago Louise and I breifly chatted about Enrons involvement in this effort Clearly there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participatethey quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequentlyAll of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvementinfact yet the question remains is there someone at Enron directly involved in Enrons eBusiness initiatives interested in jumping into this effort and participating Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense or the time and expense of one of your senior at least Director level people to participate Would it be viewed at least at this time simply as an Enron brain drain Ive received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron The bottom line is Id like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that at this time Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the financial level it has already investedwith the option to participate at other levels in the future at Enrons discretion ALL comments solicited Many thanks Christie Forwarded by Christie PatrickHOUECT on PM HartleyR on PM To cc Subject ICGWharton Forum
