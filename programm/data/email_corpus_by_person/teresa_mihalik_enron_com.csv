Molly Cross Darren Subject FW Enron Direct Canada Corp LCs Expiring DebbieBill Enron Direct Canada Corp EES Canada has LCs expiring In order to continue serving current retail customers under existing contracts and adding new retail customers in Alberta the security requirements will need to be met Enron Direct Canada Corp has estimated what their requirements will be as of the time the LCs expire and is outlined in the email below The total security requirement comes to approximately million USD The bank we now have the LCs with The TorontoDominion Bank has notified Enron Corp Treasury that they will not renew the LCs Enron Corp does not meet the credit requirements to provide a guaranty In order to continue to operate under these contracts in Alberta it looks like our only alternatives at this point are to either provide new LCs or post cash At the end of November we expect we will be requested to provide this security Please let us know what additional information you will need to consider this request for security Teresa Original Message From Joslyn Kate Sent Friday November AM To Flaman Derek Mihalik Teresa Cc Poffenroth Lori Domingo Leela Cross Darren Slaughter Christopher Hedstrom Peggy Powley Barry Subject RE Enron Direct Canada Corp LCs Expiring Theresa At the time that the Enmax LC was put in place Enmax would only accept Parental Guarantees from Companies with an A rating To my knowledge they have not lowered the threshold Kate Original Message From Flaman Derek Sent Thursday November PM To Mihalik Teresa Cc Poffenroth Lori Domingo Leela Cross Darren Joslyn Kate Slaughter Christopher Hedstrom Peggy Powley Barry Subject RE Enron Direct Canada Corp LCs Expiring Theresa With respect to Enmax and credit requirements for a guarantor there are no specific ratings thresholds in the legal documentation Enmax Terms and Conditions I will work with Kate to ascertain who in Enmax credit department knows what these specific ratings thresholds are if any Once done either Kate or I will advise With respect to general processes surrounding holding cash at a Canadian bank I know that Enron Canadas policy is to not take cash collateral by wire transfer into a bank account The primary reason for this policy involves risks associated with our Personal Property Registration System to perfect a security interest in a wire transfer requires the registration of a financing statement multijurisdictional cumbersome even with such registration one is not guaranteed priority Again this is Enron Canadas position with respect to cash collateral I do not know why Enmax would not accept the C but suspect that their reasons may be the same As far as the process of holding cash at a Canadian bank I will speak with the relevant operationscredit person perhaps Lori andor Cheryl Dawes and have them contact you Please let me know if you need further assistance with respect to this matter Derek Original Message From Mihalik Teresa Sent Thursday November PM To Cross

which change over time Jim Original Message From Leff Dan Sent Tuesday November AM To Hughes Evan Steffes James D Subject Performance Surety Bonds Jim Evan As you are probably aware the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation As an example EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance payments bonds for its business that requires these We are addressing this with the bonding companies now All of their existing bonds are in place and in force In light of this I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDCs and LDCs Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place what drives the capacity requirements status renewal expiration date current payment status etc I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work what triggers increases decreases in capacity and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients Thanks Dan
