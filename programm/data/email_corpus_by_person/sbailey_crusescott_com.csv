Mountain Smoky SMTP Sent Wednesday February AM To McLeroy David Subject RE Did I tell you about my wildlife experience two weekends ago I sent the following email to Will Original Message From Mountain Smoky Sent Tuesday February AM To Subject RE Fwd Fwd FW Test How you doing Have you spoken to Clay since he and I went to yalls ranch We had a truly wild time Early Saturday morning we ran into a little family of javelinas and had a stare down from about feet with a young male after his sows and piglets crossed directly in front of us wout notice We were all cammoed up and I imagine we may have looked like that Predator creature to him As he was crossing the path he must have caught our scent as he first turned his head in our direction and then fully squared off directly in front of me in the middle of the small game trail we were on He was looking right at me but I could tell he couldnt really SEE me Neither Clay nor I moved even a fraction Clay was close behind me and to my right looking over my shoulder so we may have looked like a two headed predator but more importantly Clay was blocking my escape path There was a very large and thick prickly pear cactus outgrowth to my left At first it was just an incredibly cool nature experience I expected him to catch our scent at any moment and hightail it But he didnt After staring at us for maybe a full mins his wet black snout occasionally flaring giving me an exceptional view of the blotched pink insides of his nostrils he took a very pronounced step toward us Right front leg bent in mid air he then very deliberately stomped it down hard on the ground making a small thumping noise He then followed this with the left front leg Stomp Between each step hed inhale with a deep audible snort trying to figure us out Step stomp pause snort Step stomp pause snort Step stomp pause snort Step stomp pause snort Now not knowing much about Javelinas and figuring this little dude didnt weigh more than lbs I wasnt exactly scared but I was definitely on an adrenaline high my heart racing I was slightly concerned that if on the off chance that he did charge which I honestly didnt think hed would I was going to be in some trouble I doubted I could have gotten a shot off and Clay as I said was blocking my escape path I lost my nerve after what seemed like mins of this he was now within feet of me I turned my head very slowly to the side never taking my eyes off the little fire plug to ask Clay how close should we let him get The slight motion of my head turning was all he needed He apparently now had a lock on his target me and he charged It all happened so damn fast but there was that surreal quality of slowmotion over the next seconds He opened his mouth really wide unusually freakishly wide and I could see two large incisor teeth on his bottom jaw jutting up or inches These had NOT been evident to me prior to this Simultaneously I sensed Clay turning to run FAST For whatever reason running was not even an option I considered I swung my shotgun seven to ten inches to my center instantaneously deciding this was going to have to be a hip shot I somehow calmly thumbed the safety off aimed and fired at this oncoming mass of mouth and course black hair now probably no more than three feet directly in front of me I was loaded with two gauge slugs The single shot I fired blew a fairly large hole through the top of his head but his forward momentum carried him through my legs at shin level knocking me hard forward and over the javelina splaying me stomach first flat on the ground still clutching my shotgun The fall knocked the wind out of me but I quickly got up on one knee not knowing how true my aim had been and swung my gun back on the downed pig No movement whatsoever It was eerily quiet for just a few seconds and I felt a slight and strange breeze I then heard some crashing noise in the brush near by and one of the sows exploded through the thicket to my left coming right for me Holy shit I couldnt believe it Still kneeling and still with no breath I swung my shouldered shotgun and shot her in the chest at probably fifteen feet Because I was on my knees the blast hit her squarely and lifted her up and to the left of the trail But to my horror immediately behind her and coming FAST was a LARGE male we had not previously seen He looked twice the size of the first javelina He was all gray and grizzled and he too had his mouth fully opened his tusks literally gleaming However I was seeing his charge head on at eye level out of ammo and quite frankly nothing was going through my mind other than OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT I then heard Clay yellhollerdemand VERY loudly DONT MOVE and then BAMMMMM I didnt move My eyes were glued to the boar Clays shot nailed the old male in the left shoulder powering him ten feet to my left from the spot of impact as if hed been kicked by a giant invisible boot before he came to a sudden stop against a mesquite tree Three shots in maybe seconds three dead javelinas blood and stink everywhere Clay came running over to me yelling something like Are you OK Are you OK and helped me up the rest of the way I was shaking like a leaf and trying to get my breath back and he started laughing hard I mean really hard after seeing I was OK Somehow I had javalena blood on the left palm of my hand After dusting off I notice the inside of my left pant leg was ripped and my left boot was cleanly sheered from the inside of my right ankle through the top of the boot where the calf starts but my skin was not even nicked Mannnn Ill never think of those damn javelina the same way again and I dont even want to think what may have happened if Clay hadnt shot the big male Can you believe it Later Smoke Original
