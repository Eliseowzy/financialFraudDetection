Advertising opportunities are also available on our website SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will represent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europe to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decision is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merger strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategic contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas trading and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japans first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals including Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealing to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closely may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts

consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid

Investigated for Alberta Price Fixing Forwarded by Cindy DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Ann M Schmidt PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM

number of significant organizational changes These change s are intended to accomplish four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d markets Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American

Derecskey on PM To Mark NRON Aleck CT Robert CT Richard B CT Eric NRON David W CT Richard nron John J nron Mark nron Greg CT Jeff NRON Kenneth NRON James NRON Steven J nron cc Subject Enron Powerex Investigated for Alberta Price Fixing Forwarded by Cindy DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Ann M Schmidt PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM

Advertising opportunities are also available on our website SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will represent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europe to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decision is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merger strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategic contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas trading and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japans first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals including Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealing to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closely may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts

Organizational Changes Forwarded by Stephanie HarrisCorpEnron on PM Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling Sent by Enron Announcements PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Organizational Changes We are making a number of significant organizational changes These change s are intended to accomplish four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d markets Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American European including Japan and Australia Global Markets and Industrial Markets operations and will be expanded to include Enrons Net Works business u nit as well as a new unit Enron Global Assets In addition Enrons me rchant businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below Mark Frevert currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units

Throughout the transition Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services Following the transition Jim will join EES In addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Gregs

Investigated for Alberta Price Fixing Forwarded by Cindy DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Ann M Schmidt PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM

Advertising opportunities are also available on our website SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will represent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europe to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decision is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merger strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategic contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas trading and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japans first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals including Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealing to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closely may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts

mailtoIMCEANOTESownerliberalartsalumnilistsEccEutexasEedu NRONcom On Behalf Of Richard W Lariviere Sent Friday May PM To Liberal Arts Alumni Subject News from UT Liberal Arts Dear Friends May is drawing to an end and we have just completed the moving and meaningful celebrations of commencement A total of Liberal Arts students received their diplomas In a few days you will be able to experience the ceremony vicariously by reading the remarks of History Commencement speaker Admiral Bob Inman which you will be able to access at colanewsreleasesindexhtml As students enroll in their courses for next year the prevailing wisdom seems to be that taking fewer hours will yield higher grades In fact the opposite is true According to a threeyear study by the Office of Admissions students carrying hours outperformed their classmates taking hours Nevertheless the portion of students attempting hours is decreasing from in to about in The correlation between hour course load and a higher GPA was true in all racialethnic groups and despite differences in academic ability as measured by the SATACT tests This is important information and you can help by disseminating it widely especially to current and incoming students The University could serve many more students if students moved through their college program in a shorter time College costs would diminish and earning capacity would increase I have just returned from a wonderful visit to Midland where Advisory Council ViceChair Brian McLaughlin made sure I saw all that his hometown has to offer We talked with prospective students at the Trinity School and at Midland High School and Lee High School had lunch with fellow Advisory Council member Cadell Liedtke and even visited the Haley Library Successes abound S Gail Caldwell American Studies MA and BA alumna was just awarded a Pulitzer Prize in the area of Distinguished Criticism for her insightful observations on contemporary life and literature in

letters over the years has made its way onto the net I have advised Joannie that she should not respond to this Jim Original Message From Williamson Joannie Sent Wednesday March AM To Derrick Jr James Subject URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED Thought you should see this Thanks Joannie Forwarded by Joannie WilliamsonCorpEnron on AM rasheed mohammed on PM To cc Subject URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED Dear Friend I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed the newly appointed head of the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN I got your contact from a business directory of your country and based on your business activities and the type of investment I have in mind I found you to be the most suitable person for the transaction stated below Before I proceed I want to strongly advice that you devoid yourself from the general conception you have about Nigerians I would like you to carefully study this proposal without bias since it would be relevant in our lives It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and highranking government officials to divert governments money into their private accounts this is usually done through CBN with the connivance of senior officials The ministers and military generals especially during the era of late general sani Abacha achieve this by diverting most of the funds meant for the development of their respective agencies and ministries into the CBN escrow accounts Usually it is this same escrow account that holds funds for the payment of foreign contracts With the help of the inside officials the minister or senior government officials and military generals would now create themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign partner to create them as artificial contractors using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money to the nominated bank account of their foreign partners In this case the money is treated as payment for foreign contract and there is no trace This is how federal governments money is siphoned on a regular basis to the extent that most people now result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge they have about it Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the central bank he did not have enough time to perfect and tidy up the transactions they have in place So the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow account with no records I just discovered this in a bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of our escrow account to the federal government and the governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow account to declare to the government the total amount that have been spent in the last three years and what it was spent for So in the course of carrying out the above exercise I discovered a total sum of MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to anyone and with no records My intention is to reveal about USD M to the federal government so that I can be in his good books and make arrangement to transfer the outstanding USD M into a safe account abroad It is based on this that I am making this urgent contact with you However I am doing this because of the nature of my job I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more so there is no way I can remain in this office forever I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director which is just next year So I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire Besides if I declare the total funds to the government it would probably go into the pockets of a few people that control the government This is to enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria So do not blame me for my action because you would do the same if you were in my shoes knowing fully well that there will be no compensation even if you disclose everything to the government Well I have discovered that I can transfer this money if we could quickly create you as an artificial contractor by using your company document and Bank account to receive the money in the same way my successor transferred theirs The only difference is that the final payment is going to be made to your named company through any of our correspondent payment center in Europe or America due to the policies adopted by the new democratic government The entire process is not easy but it is achievable due to my position in the foreign remittance department of the CBN and the relationship I have with the present director of external payment and finance of the federal ministry of finance The entire operation will be between the three of us I I shall take care of all documentation ii My friend in the federal ministry of finance will take care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all documentation iii You shall take care of the banking arrangements provide the needed invoices to enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment center you shall be paid from After we have succeeded in transferring this funds shall be retained by you for your assistance for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the course of this transaction and the remaining shall be for me and my colleague which we would possibly invest in into your company or any viable business venture you suggest If you are comfortable with this programme please revert to me at once via telephone number or fax number Should your response be positive I would then instruct on the next step to take Due to security reasons when you call do not ask for any name simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone number Once I reconfirm my number to be you can then mention my name before you go into any discussion If I fail to reply correctly do not wait for a second trial just drop the phone and call back later We demand a quick response from you Any delay might result in contacting someone else Irrespective of what happens we count on your maturity to keep the transaction to yourself So you are advised to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality Looking forward to your urgent response Yours faithfully Dr Rasheed Mohammed Do You Yahoo Get email at your own domain with Yahoo Mail

using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money to the nominated bank account of their foreign partners In this case the money is treated as payment for foreign contract and there is no trace This is how federal governments money is siphoned on a regular basis to the extent that most people now result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge they have about it Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the central bank he did not have enough time to perfect and tidy up the transactions they have in place So the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow account with no records I just discovered this in a bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of our escrow account to the federal government and the governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow account to declare to the government the total amount that have been spent in the last three years and what it was spent for So in the course of carrying out the above exercise I discovered a total sum of MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to anyone and with no records My intention is to reveal about USD M to the federal government so that I can be in his good books and make arrangement to transfer the outstanding USD M into a safe account abroad It is based on this that I am making this urgent contact with you However I am doing this because of the nature of my job I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more so there is no way I can remain in this office forever I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director which is just next year So I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire Besides if I declare the total funds to the government it would probably go into the pockets of a few people that control the government This is to enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria So do not blame me for my action because you would do the same if you were in my shoes knowing fully well that there will be no compensation even if you disclose everything to the government Well I have discovered that I can transfer this money if we could quickly create you as an artificial contractor by using your company document and Bank account to receive the money in the same way my successor transferred theirs The only difference is that the final payment is going to be made to your named company through any of our correspondent payment center in Europe or America due to the policies adopted by the new democratic government The entire process is not easy but it is achievable due to my position in the foreign remittance department of the CBN and the relationship I have with the present director of external payment and finance of the federal ministry of finance The entire operation will be between the three of us I I shall take care of all documentation ii My friend in the federal ministry of finance will take care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all documentation iii You shall take care of the banking arrangements provide the needed invoices to enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment center you shall be paid from After we have succeeded in transferring this funds shall be retained by you for your assistance for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the course of this transaction and the remaining shall be for me and my colleague which we would possibly invest in into your company or any viable business venture you suggest If you are comfortable with this programme please revert to me at once via telephone number or fax number Should your response be positive I would then instruct on the next step to take Due to security reasons when you call do not ask for any name simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone number Once I reconfirm my number to be you can then mention my name before you go into any discussion If I fail to reply correctly do not wait for a second trial just drop the phone and call back later We demand a quick response from you Any delay might result in contacting someone else Irrespective of what happens we count on your maturity to keep the transaction to yourself So you are advised to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality Looking forward to your urgent response Yours faithfully Dr Rasheed Mohammed Do

arranging a meeting with Jonathan to see if he can shed s ome light on this strange opinion and on why we were denied our costs on th e restitution point He may not be available until after Easter I have s poken to Laurence who describes the opinion as pathetic Perhaps even more interesting and somewhat troubling is the fact that it was actually Pollac k who said to Laurence that Enron had been stitched up by the Lords and t hat the opinion was a joke I do not want to sound like a sore loser but it does make one think this is a bit of a kangaroo court if the winning cou nsel says the result is a joke Anyway it is not a very funny one In al l seriousness perhaps we should consider whether we ought to modify our pol icy permitting submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English cour ts I realize they have not historically honored the nonexclusive jurisdi ction clauses but at least it might give us a fighting chance to go to a m ore neutral venue like Switzerland Anyway give it some thought I will let you know as soon as I have been able to speak with Jonathan Again ma ny thanks for your wonderful support every step of the way FromJames nronXgate on CDT ToMary Nell CT cc SubjectRE CATS litigation Mary Nell no one could have worked harder or better than you in the effort to bring about a just decision in this matter Thank you for your tireles s effortsI am proud to serve on the Enron team with you All the best Ji m Original Message From Browning Mary Nell SentWednesday April PM ToDerrick Jr James Brown Michael Sherriff John Evans Mark Dyso n Fernley Chivers Paul Frevert Mark Whalley Greg McConnell Mike G entle Jackie Sanders Richard Wright Claire Patel Tax Raj Rogers Rex CcHarper Richard Turner Paul Crilly Peter SubjectCATS litigation Disappointingly the House of Lords ruled against Enron in the CATS l itigation today This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties app roximately million plus interest and court costs putting the final fi gure at an estimated million We expect to be invoiced for the pr incipal amount in the next week or so sorting costs and interest may take as long as days The written opinion reflects a determination on the pa rt of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says T he opinion seeks to conclude what rational businessmen could have intended rather than applying the provisions of the contract For example Lord Hoffman author of the primary opinion makes it clear th at the retrospective consequences of discovering a latent defect after p ayments have been made and would therefore need to be refunded are unacce ptable His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow JBloc k gas during the period of the T leak we are not damaged and therefore n ot entitled to relief under the contract Furthermore he says that the Co mmencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a decl aration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective As far as the price reduction formula in Clause Lord Hoffman opines th at the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the JBlock field T he contract makes no reference to this requirement Hoffmans view is that it is only upon tiein that the CATS parties obligation to provide the Tr ansportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduc tion for not providing the service unless tiein is complete This statemen t is in stark contrast with Hoffmans earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an a bsolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected ou r submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue As you may recall restitution was the primary issue u pon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing Reimbursement of these costs sho uld have been a given Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister ou r other counsel have assessed the opinion as appalling and pathetic an d describe the situation as one where Enron has been stitched up Unfort unately given that this is the court of last resort in this country excep t of course the Court of Human Rights there is not an avenue for recourse In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted o r expected from the House of Lords I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years The case has been a roller coas ter ride I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it ri ght Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion My telephone number is Many thanks

Message From Leach Doug Sent Tuesday October AM To Lundstrom Bruce Walls Jr Rob Derrick Jr James Subject FW Article sent from The Hindu fyi Original Message From ENRON Sent Tuesday October AM To undisclosedrecipientsENRON Subject Article sent from The Hindu An interesting article Could it happen This article is emailed to you by tushar s dhruv Source The Hindu Dabhol and the do nothing Government By Prem Shankar Jha Ever since the Vajpayees Government came to power more than two and a half years ago the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known In the nine months since December industrial growth has averaged per cent The decade when it averaged per cent and the months only five years ago when it touched per cent are now but a distant memory Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September terrorist strikes in the US It has now shrunk dramatically vehicle sales dropped by percent in September and colour TV sets registered a growth of a measly to per cent With no demand to power it inflation measured by the consumer price index has fallen almost to zero The share market is dead and there is no fresh investment Employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place however humble in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away By the number will have risen by another three million But Mr Yashwant Sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the countrys problems But one recent event highlights the governments paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do This is its failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the Maharashtra State Electricity Boardss attempt to foil Enrons bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement The London Court correctly maintained that just as a governments international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court The way has therefore been cleared for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations Given the fearsome proficiency of Enrons lawyers both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB will lose the case If that happens then by a conservative estimate India will have to pay around billion in costs and damages In addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase II of the project Thus in the end the project is likely to cost not billion but more like to billion For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a State Government and a private company and it had no say in the matter That pretext in any case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues But today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable let alone willing to pay such an enormous penalty So the bill will inevitably land at the Centres door And that means the taxpayers door The Centre will have no option but to pay But having done so will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government The answer obviously is no What it will be forced to do is transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete and operate But since no one can possibly run a billion power plant generating MW of power profitably the NTPC too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first Judging from the offers that the Tata Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply Company BSES were making to Enron the written down value will not exceed billion Thus whichever way we look at it the country will end by paying for a Dabholsize power plant billion without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else in return None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao government agreed to price its power on a costplus basis Nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning the latters inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future For better or for worse the Enron deal was struck and it was struck not once but twice As a serious responsible government that knows the importance of honouring ones word in a world where contract is king the Vajpayee Government must honour the countrys contractual obligations This does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhols power affordable are known to all As the Renegotiating Committee and the Godbole Committee recommended the Government should buy the million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast In fact it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant This is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need This will bring down the capital cost upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated to billion Second the Central Government should buy per cent of the equity in Dabhol from the promoters This was negotiated with the committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to billion The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate With the price of oil having fallen for India to around a barrel these changes will bring down the cost of Dabhols power at per cent capacity utilisation own to below Rs a unit This will make it entirely viable especially if Maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudorural sector The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the MSEB renegotiate it with Enron or if Enron wants to opt out then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the NTPC Getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhols power nor answer the more basic question how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity Copyrights The Hindu Republication or redissemination of the contents

please do not hesitate to let me know All advice and suggestions from friends are truly welcome Have a good weekend Les Forwarded by Leslie E LoBaughLCRNMPC on PM Kenneth M Tompkins AM To Leslie E MPC cc Subject Niagara MohawkNational Grid Announce Proposed Merger and Rate Plan Settlement Agreement The following news release was issued at am EDT am BST You will also be receiving a Merger Update on this announcement later this morning Niagara MohawkNational Grid Merger Joint Proposal Expected to Drop Residential Electricity Bills percent New York State Department of Public Service Staff IBEW Local Business Consumer and Environmental Groups Support Agreement SYRACUSE and WESTBOROUGH Oct Niagara Mohawk Power Corps residential customers are expected to see a percent electricity bill decrease under a proposed merger and rate plan settlement agreement announced by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc NYSENMK and National Grid Group plc NYSE NGG The agreement reached with the New York State Department of Public Service staff and other parties was filed late Thursday with the New York State Public Service Commission for approval If the merger closes it would result in net customer savings of about billion over the next years compared with rates projected without the merger Also as part of the agreement the companies would expand Niagara Mohawks annual Upstate New York economic development efforts by million Niagara Mohawks merger with National Grid will allow us to reduce and stabilize energy delivery costs and enhance our commitment to economic development in the communities we serve said William F Edwards Niagara Mohawks senior vice president and chief financial officer We believe this agreement will provide significant benefits to Upstate customers and to the economy The rate cuts lowincome protection and other benefits agreed to in this plan will help National Grid fulfill our commitment to become a positive presence in Upstate New York said Lawrence Reilly senior vice president and general counsel for National Grid USA The significant size of the merged companies will provide us with the resources and skills necessary to deliver firstrate customer service while being a lowcost provider of electricity and natural gas service he said He added that the agreement details a comprehensive service quality plan under which customer safety reliability and service will be maintained and enhanced after the merger The plan calls for up to million in annual penalties or more under certain conditions if defined customer service and reliability goals arent achieved Niagara Mohawks actual costs for delivery of electricity are expected to drop by more than percent through the merger When those savings are applied to a customers entire electricity bill which also includes the cost of electricity purchased the net savings are projected to equal percent The reduction would be implemented upon consummation of the merger At that time todays agreement calls for customers delivery charges to be immediately reduced by approximately million After that decrease delivery charges would remain stabilized for years subject to limited adjustments In addition the companies would forgo collection of approximately million in nuclear costs that otherwise would have been collected from customers The longterm proposal has a number of other initiatives including Pricestabilized electricity commodity service for residential and small commercial customers for several years providing those customers with significant protection from any major fluctuations in the generation marketplace The extension by months of a multiyear gas rate settlement resulting in gas delivery rates unchanged since remaining the same through December The extension of the LowIncome Customer Assistance Program which was expanded under Niagara Mohawks existing regulatory agreement with the PSC and the development of a special rate for eligible lowincome customers The establishment of electricity choice educational programs targeted to customers and energy service companies Environmental benefits such as interconnection assistance for wind power sources support for green power marketing and the continued sale of surplus land for preservation The agreement culminates five months of negotiations among Niagara Mohawk National Grid the Department of Public Service staff and other parties including large industrial customers energy service companies and various state agencies This joint proposal continues the recent downward trend in Niagara Mohawks delivery rates for businesses and provides additional rate and service options for those customers all of which should enhance business expansion and economic development across Upstate New York said Robert Loughney on behalf of Multiple Intervenors a trade association representing the interests of the states largest commercial and industrial employers The proposed settlement is supported by two major national environmental groups the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense It also is supported by the American Wind Energy Association and by Community Energy a green power marketing company The merger agreement benefits the environment and the economy by providing customers with an easy way to purchase renewable energy products on their electricity bill and by stimulating a large new investment in wind energy generation in Upstate New York said David Wooley counsel for the four environmental interests In this proposal National Grid demonstrates that it intends to continue Niagara Mohawks established record of responsible environmental stewardship A leading advocacy group for lowincome customers also supports the joint settlement proposal Specifically and positively addressed in this proposal are the needs of many customers who struggle to make ends meet said Ben Wiles an attorney for the Public Utility Law Project The opportunity created by the merger of National Grid USA and Niagara Mohawk will result in a special reduced rate for as many as eligible lowincome customers It also will expand Niagara Mohawks safety net program to allow more people to receive assistance Among the other parties to sign the settlement was the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local which represents Niagara Mohawks unionized work force In addition the Distributed Generation Power Coalition energy marketers energy services companies and regional economic development agencies support the settlement proposal The companies have asked that the matter be considered at the PSCs Nov meeting The merger also is subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc is an investorowned energy services company that provides electricity to more than million customers across square miles of Upstate New York The company also delivers natural gas to more than customers over square miles of eastern central and northern New York National Grid USA includes local electric companies Massachusetts Electric Narragansett Electric Granite State Electric Nantucket Electric and a substantial transmission

Bruce Cc Kean Steven J Palmer Mark A PR Denne Karen Mayeux Gay Cline Wade Subject FW Economic Times article FIs may take over Enron for m FYI the Economic Times in India has published the following article which suggests details of a DPC buyout While this article does not accurately reflect the reception Wade Cline has been receiving in Delhi it may be a trial balloon by the Prime Ministers office to gauge public reaction Dow Jones has already carried a shortened version of the story a copy of whic h appears at the bottom of this email We are using the following stateme nt to respond to media inquiries Media Statement DPC continues to hold discussions with GoI IFIs regarding the sale of for eign sponsor equity in the Dabhol project It would not be appropriate to e laborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the sta tus of these buyout discussions While we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue DPC conti nues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in order to protect the interests of DPCs stakeholders ECONOMIC TIMES Tuesday October Enron nears deal to sell DPC to IFIs at discount IFIs may take over Enron for m Shubhrangshu Roy US power giant Enron is in advanced stages of negotiations to dispose of it s controversial Indian venture Dabhol Power Company at a per cent discou nt to the financial institutions at a price of million Enron and the FIs led by the Industrial Development Bank of India are sai d to be close to finalising a broad agreement to this effect in the next fe w days The final settlement should be worked out before Prime Minister Ata l Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the US in the second week of November Should the deal go through Enron is likely to settle for a fiveyear payment plan in equal instalments to minimise a heavy onetime foreign exchange outgo Enron claims its financial exposure in DPC is over billion It had earli er insisted that it be paid this sum for any outofcourt settlement and to enable its exit from India Now it is likely to settle for a lesser amount that is in the excess of million but definitely lower than mil lion which is its actual equity exposure in DPC Sources close to the ongo ing negotiations say that the government is eager that the FIs take over DP C quickly so that the Prime Minister can tell US President George W Bush du ring his forthcoming visit to Washington that justice has been done to the power major Enron chairman Kenneth Lay known to be close to the US President was the biggest donor to Bushs campaign kitty A settlement of the Enron imbroglio being played out since early this year is seen to be important to enhanc ing Indias political relationship with the US The government is keen that the FIs take over DPC to avoid prolonged negotiations on a settlement that would be necessary if a private Indian promoter were to step in So far B SES and Tata Power have evinced interest in taking over DPC but their offe r prices are said to be too low The FIs on the other hand are keen on an early settlement as they have a huge loan exposure of over Rs crore Should the FIs take over the company they are expected to warehouse the p roject before selling it to a private buyer This is expected to take at le ast days Any prospective private sector buyer would need at least a month to underta ke a proper due diligence of DPCs accounts Thereafter the FIs could take at least another days to make an open offer and another month to close the sale with a private bidder or the Stateowned National Thermal Power Co rporation Sources say of the billionplus exposure claimed by Enron in DPC Enron s equity exposure along with its US partners GE and Bechtel is m illion The company also claims to have spent around

Rob Subject Jeffnice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday and to meet you at the luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick Thought you might be interested in the report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection with the bike ride over the weekend Several persons who have either pledged or are considering a pledge to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking if I am still alive after the MS charity bike ride held this past weekend Others have asked for a report of my experience I am alive and sore If you are not interested in the report please delete this email First of all for those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society thanks is an inadequate word Remember that you are helping colleagues and others and perhaps yourself with your contributions This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story unlike anything I ever expected Here is my story if you are interested BASIC FACTS I did show up for the bike ride am Saturday I did start the bike ride am with approximately bikers in the largest charity bike ride in the country I did ride my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day some miles down the road I did either ride my bike or push it up several hills for approx miles of the mile route I crossed the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the deadline of pm on Sunday I ended up meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip That resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the pack of bike riders and was passed by nearly all of them before I reached Austin I am extremely pleased to have participated in the event I dont have the time to participate in such events very often and I was fortunate to have a schedule which opened up just in time for me to enter this event RANDOM GENERAL OBSERVATIONS The charity event title MS is a misnomer When I signed up for this event I understood the part of the event title to refer to the mileage between Houston and Austin I was wrong The I now understand to mean the approximate number of blisters to be found on ones posterior when a biker crosses the finish line I have driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past There are routes between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle grade We took a different route The ride from Houston to Austin by car is about miles The route we took was almost miles further The bike ride route displayed on a map appeared similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an Aggie to find the shortest distance between two points Road kill if far more attractive from a car than from a bike The chicken ranch in LaGrange is long gone but the spirit lingers The LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the first day of biking We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with ranch dressing I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served and wondered whether the historical connection was intentional STRATEGY I knew when I signed up for this event that I had almost no chance of completing the ride which at the time I entered I thought was only miles I had not trained at all for the bike ride and was and am not physically fit and dont exercise as I should The total extent of my bike riding during the year prior to the event was when rode my mountain bike from my home to a sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the trip Round trip my training ride to the sporting goods store was about miles I sufficiently realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some advantage to make up for the lack of althletic readiness I came up with what I thought was the perfect solution Before the race started I looked for the largest biker I could spot My plan was that if I rode my bike during the ride immediately behind a very large person I could draft that person Nascar style and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage I thought it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person had a slower pace than I desired the advantage would be apparent by the end of the ride Luckily I found just the person I was seekingthis person appeared to be about poundsa body that would clear a nice swath of air for me to follow When the race started I maneuvered my bike and pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker For the first minutes of the ride my strategy worked greatI actually could tell that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly behind this large person Then the unexpected happenedmy large person biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust Never again on this bike ride was I again able to catch and draft another biker I needed a new strategyperhaps a tail wind which did in fact materialize in spades but not before noon the second day of the ride THE RIDE IN DETAIL I signed up for this event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a result of my schedule opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily commited I did it largely on a lark but the event took on new meaning when I learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I started the fund raising effort which is a required part of participating as a rider I knew I was out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco in even attempting this strenuous activity I agreed that I could not keep up the normal pace of younger and far more physically fit bikers So I made a pledge to myself No matter what I was not going to overexert myself I would establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being winded I succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of the ride I kept a pace that was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride for the first hours or so which was mostly level road I was very happy with the ride and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the announcer has promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker when we reached Bellville about miles from Houston When I got to Bellville I came to realize that my pace although not strenous was substantially off the mark With a box lunch prepared for over riders there were only four box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville As I thought back I remembered being passed by many bikers I did pass by my count bikes before lunch as if they were standing still They were They all had flat tires I decided I needed to pick up the pace at little after lunch I headed out after a quick lunch to try to make up some time By around to I was really getting tired and although still cautious about over exertion I was losing energy fast I stopped at a pay phone booth in a small town and called home I told my year old son William I did not think I would make it much further But I wanted to go as far as I could I rode about more miles and was almost totally out of steam when I remember thinking I desparately need a long rest About that time I looked up at a road sign that said Cemetery next exit The symbolic connection was compelling I decided it was time to take a resta temporary not a permanent one I biked past the cemetery where I lay down in some high grass along the road to catch my breath The local chiggars and I bonded almost immediately I then flagged down a SAG bus designed to pick up weary bikers and got help loading first my bike then my body into a van I remember telling the driver that I was finished and that I did not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin I was extremely disappointed because I had gone only about miles and about of the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled I concluded I was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal After traveling in the van for about miles we came upon the entrance to a ranch of a friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago I asked the van driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was home I went to visit the friend but he was not at his ranch house and I ended up spending about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him I finally decided to leave and found that the rest had given me new strength I thought I might be able to ride again To make a long story short I rode for about another hours straight until it was total dark A van came and picked me up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue I was only miles short of LaGrange our stopover spot for the night and the van carried me on to this historic spot I had really been looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a member of Team Enron and Enrons hospitality for its bike riders was by reputation outstanding They had hired messeuses to give massages to the Team Enron bikers and a dinner fit for a king would be waiting Unfortunately by the time I arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds our accomodations for the evening dinner in the Enron tent was over and all the masseuses had vanished I finally found a general meal service hosted by the local Rotarians who were serving barbecued chicken and a salad with ranch dressing Since I didnt enter the bike event until less than two weeks before it started Team Enrons private tent was full and I was relegated to find sleeping space on my own I was directed to a huge feedlot covered with a large tin roof open air style no walls As I nestled in my sleeping bag under the big roof with about other bikers my senses told me that I was probably to sleep where a cow going to market had probably slept only days before But I was dog tired simply wanted to sleep and didnt have the energy to find less aeromatic alternative accomodations THE SECOND DAY I was told that breakfast would be served at am the next morning and that the ride would start at sunup about am I concluded that I could sleep until am grab a quick bite and still be at the starting gate by Needless to say I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as possible I badly needed the rest My plan failed I did not take into consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of gungho superbikejocks About am some two hours before I planned to wake up a large group of overenenergeticsupercyclists arose and started doing side straddle hops stretching and various exercises while making Monica Seleslike grunting noises I was not amused There was no way to go back to sleep The five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly inadequate I was told that Day of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day because of the more hilly route as we approached Austin To make a long story short I actually gained strength on Day as compared to Day I actually learned some technique for transferring power from my arms to my legs and made it to Austin on my own power without any motorized help of any kind The ride through the hill country was spectacular Also I did get a taste of ole country Texas along the way The bike route intentionally meanders via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy highway traffic for the safety of the bikers As we passed through one small town that I never heard of before I looked up to see a sign that said THELMAS PLACEPOOL BEER DOMINOS A sign of equal size immediately adjacent said NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE It was comforting to know that patrons of that establishment could drink peacefully while game playing knowing that customers are required to go out to the parking lot to resolve domino disagreements where guns are not prohibited I guess I have spent too much time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas and have forgotten about the genuine Texas back country There was one other noteworthy diversion Cycling through Bastrop State Park is known to be one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of the extreme winding hills in this beautiful heavilywooded area The Park is also confusing because of its multiple intersecting roads through the park I was following another biker as we approached the park who was sporting a very fancy biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club I mentioned to him that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State Park because of the challenging steep hills He responded that he knew a route through the park that was not only less hilly but was also miles shorter than the route intended for the bikers I was all ears to the prospect of a short cut and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and shorter route We entered the park and for the next miles according to my odometer it seemed like a roller coaster ride with turning steep inclines and dangerously steep and turning declines Exactly one hour and ten minutes after we entered the park we finally exited the parkat the exact same place where we entered I was exhausted and not amused I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to find the shortest route to Austin To fast forward the story since this has been far too long already I made it to Austin on my own power and did not ask for a lift at all the second day I was looking forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived at the finishing line at the UT baseball stadium in Austin I had put in my most strenuous effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very hilly Austin area where every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing cousin Unfortunately for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming back to Houston I was told just after crossing the finish line that the last bus would leave for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time to shower At that point in time I looked like I just stepped out of a sweat shower The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I dreadedhe introduced himself and waited for a reply I really didnt want this guy to know my namethe name of the guy who was giving the bus the aroma of gymnasium locker room so after a moments thought I held out my still sweaty hand and proudly said Howdy my names Harry Reasoner Conclusion I participated in this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and others who are victims of MS If you previously made one of those weirdo pledges that are impossible for anyone to calculate please send my secretary a check made payable to National Multiple Sclerosis Society in whatever amount makes you happy If you have not made a donation wont you do so today You will benefit by giving as much as the people with MS who need your help Thank you

Joe SentWednesday November AM ToMcMahon Jeffrey Sherriff John CcKitchen Louise Bowen Jr Raymond Brown Michael COO London Gol d Joe Derrick Jr James Farmer Michael Heffron Kevin Hutchinson Mi chael Jones Timothy Lynch Drew SubjectEML Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Jeff John We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals Limited EML As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint Aft er your review we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss If you co ncur with the actions suggested please advise If there is any balance sh eet debtorcreditor or cash forecast information that you require please let us know Drew Lynch Kevin Heffron Jonathan Marsh and Joe Gold Introduction Enron Metals Limited EML maintains a unique position within Enron Corp EML is one of Enrons two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service s Authority FSA the UK financial regulator and Enrons only remaining b rokerage business Given its special status EML has responsibilities to i ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L ME metals exchange of which it is a member As a result of this regulato ry oversight there are several differences between EML and Enrons other b usinesses EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato ry rules relating among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus iness Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers By virtue of its position as an LME broker there are certain circumst ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients EMLs p olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible however EMLs cond uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship to exist How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th e FSA and the LME Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an d to protect against systemic risk EMLs position as a provider of liquidi ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME As a co nsequence of this concern the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi tion and credit risk The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem ent These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital which can be used by way of regulatory capital and a breach of these rules is regarded as extremely serious An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c ease carrying on business EMLs board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for a breach of the rules Penalties for individuals include significant fines and possible expulsion from the industry The duties owed by board members under the FSAs rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r elating to directors duties Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem onstrate to the FSA that to the full extent possible the financial streng th of EML is ringfenced from any financial problems being encountered by t he rest of Enron In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below Issues Surrounding Liquidity As we are all aware over the past week as a result of the reputation probl ems the corporation has been faced with we have substantially increased th e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML This was a precautio n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML Clearly the goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing of EML was fully and completely ring fenced from any problems related to t he nonEML related problems of Enron This of course needed to be accompli shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was concerned The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains and distributes its cash In the event that cash is lent outside of EML it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap ital of the firm however the firm has a number of options to preserve its day to day liquidity In its position as an LME broker EML must have access to cash for two purp oses First it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House LCH In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater al to the LCH it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc ement action could ensue In addition it would be declared a defaulter and the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions Second it must be able to post margin to its clients A failure to make a contractu al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre d to the FSA A third potential use of cash is to make payments to inthe money clients in the event that they wish to close their account While th ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their marktomarket pr ofits the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest ions Previously we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity However ce rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from the rest of Enron has become a concern EML has or is in the process of l osing of unsecured LCs which were primarily used in lieu of c ash at the LCH EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC s Additionally a number of clients have requested that their accounts be transferred Those transfers have reduced EMLs cash balance Was the re maining mm unsecured LC which has been issued by a single bank to be withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid ity impact The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality Therefore we have agreed to start to do the following aChange the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t he rest of the enterprise bImprove our overall cash management function so as to have the control as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel cManage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints of continuing to do business on a normal basis dObtain financial information on a much more timely basis ePeriodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis Operational Risk In theory EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account s and rely on Enron Corp for the remaining portion of its day to day cash needs EMLs board have been resistant to this practice for several very p ractical reasons First it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis I f EML relied on Enron Corps daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp or an acco unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either capital or liquidity events as EMLs clearing account at Citibank would be substantially overdrawn Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi ght create a cascade for Enron EMLs board is reluctant to put that much f aith in the accuracy of our operational safeguards Capital As noted above EML is subject to the FSAs regulatory capital rules and mu st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis The FSA requires th at EML notify it if its capital base is less than of the minimum finan cial resources requirement For a variety of reasons there were occasions when EML violated the threshold on occasions in Because these v iolations were selfcontained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain s financial resources in excess of so that it has a sufficient buffer not to trigger the FSA notification requirement In the current climate the FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari se from Enrons perceived financial weakness Accordingly if one of those violations occurred today the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM Ls cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily basis EMLs board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev el of Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces s capital adequacy go hand in hand Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce narios which would cause liquidity issues for EML Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME brokers Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly Credit exposures leading to credit losses Recommendations The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov erall operational liquidity To fully draw down the remaining mm available under the mm s ubordinated facility To monetize the intercompany marked to market positions mm To increase the subordinated facility to mm and extend the maturi ty by six months to July To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi ts and other assets held by EML To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol d for calling margin To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients other th an a select group of key relationship clients To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c ompanies EMCL and EMCC therefore shifting the need for inventory finance Current Situation Unsecured Guaranty mm Secured Guaranty mm Subordinated Loans mm EML Cash Balance mm Cash required to replace Withdrawn guarantymm EML Regulatory Capital Level Excess Reg Capital over mm Conclusion The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress test ing The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we w ould have liquidity issues Given these possible eventualities we would ur ge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to comple ting point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

MingchengLian ManagerEGMFundamentals Dear Mr Lay My employment with Enron is to be terminated the reason given by HR for not meeting performance standards However I firmly believe that this is not the real reason the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager Mr Lowell BezanisManager EGM who I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me I have since filed a written complaint to Enrons EEO Committee This committee having investigated the case has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings As a consequence my reasonable request for a redeployment package has been rejected If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past years The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for days I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner unnecessarily since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife not only towards myself but also to other employees some of whom have left as a result in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability often receiving compliments from clients This cannot be the only way to solve this issue The Trigger and Retaliation Since Mr Bezanis has been my line manager internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me On August I attended a class of natural gas structuring Mr Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs however I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms Shanna Funkhouser my HR representative The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before MsFunkhouser Mr Bezanis and Mr Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered Feeling intimidated I requested that I meet with Ms Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO as agreed previously She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination Ms Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first I was banned by him from developing the

Mike Olson Cindy Subject my unfair treatment at Enronplease HELP Ms MingchengLian ManagerEGMFundamentals Dear Mr Lay My employment with Enron is to be terminated the reason given by HR for not meeting performance standards However I firmly believe that this is not the real reason the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager Mr Lowell BezanisManager EGM who I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me I have since filed a written complaint to Enrons EEO Committee This committee having investigated the case has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings As a consequence my reasonable request for a redeployment package has been rejected If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past years The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for days I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner unnecessarily since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife not only towards myself but also to other employees some of whom have left as a result in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability often receiving compliments from clients This cannot be the only way to solve this issue The Trigger and Retaliation Since Mr Bezanis has been my line manager internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me On August I attended a class of natural gas structuring Mr Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs however I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms Shanna Funkhouser my HR representative The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before MsFunkhouser Mr Bezanis and Mr Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered Feeling intimidated I requested that I meet with Ms Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO as agreed previously She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination Ms Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially

Advertising opportunities are also available on our website SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will represent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europe to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decision is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merger strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategic contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas trading and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japans first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals including Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealing to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closely may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts

Organizational Changes Forwarded by Stephanie HarrisCorpEnron on PM Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling Sent by Enron Announcements PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Organizational Changes We are making a number of significant organizational changes These change s are intended to accomplish four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d markets Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American European including Japan and Australia Global Markets and Industrial Markets operations and will be expanded to include Enrons Net Works business u nit as well as a new unit Enron Global Assets In

Derecskey on PM To Mark NRON Aleck CT Robert CT Richard B CT Eric NRON David W CT Richard nron John J nron Mark nron Greg CT Jeff NRON Kenneth NRON James NRON Steven J nron cc Subject Enron Powerex Investigated for Alberta Price Fixing Forwarded by Cindy DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Ann M Schmidt PM To Cindy nron cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM

Gold Joe SentWednesday November AM ToMcMahon Jeffrey Sherriff John CcKitchen Louise Bowen Jr Raymond Brown Michael COO London Gol d Joe Derrick Jr James Farmer Michael Heffron Kevin Hutchinson Mi chael Jones Timothy Lynch Drew SubjectEML Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Jeff John We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals Limited EML As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint Aft er your review we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss If you co ncur with the actions suggested please advise If there is any balance sh eet debtorcreditor or cash forecast information that you require please let us know Drew Lynch Kevin Heffron Jonathan Marsh and Joe Gold Introduction Enron Metals Limited EML maintains a unique position within Enron Corp EML is one of Enrons two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service s Authority FSA the UK financial regulator and Enrons only remaining b rokerage business Given its special status EML has responsibilities to i ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L ME metals exchange of which it is a member As a result of this regulato ry oversight there are several differences between EML and Enrons other b usinesses EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato ry rules relating among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus iness Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers By virtue of its position as an LME broker there are certain circumst ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients EMLs p olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible however EMLs cond uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship to exist How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th e FSA and the LME Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an d to protect against systemic risk EMLs position as a provider of liquidi ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME As a co nsequence of this concern the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi tion and credit risk The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem ent These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital which can be used by way of regulatory capital and a breach of these rules is regarded as extremely serious An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c ease carrying on business EMLs board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for a breach of the rules Penalties for individuals include significant fines and possible expulsion from the industry The duties owed by board members under the FSAs rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r elating to directors duties Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem onstrate to the FSA that to the full extent possible the financial streng th of EML is ringfenced from any financial problems being encountered by t he rest of Enron In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below Issues Surrounding Liquidity As we are all aware over the past week as a result of the reputation probl ems the corporation has been faced with we have substantially increased th e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML This was a precautio n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML Clearly the goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing of EML was fully and completely ring fenced from any problems related to t he nonEML related problems of Enron This of course needed to be accompli shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was concerned The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains and distributes its cash In the event that cash is lent outside of EML it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap ital of the firm however the firm has a number of options to preserve its day to day liquidity In its position as an LME broker EML must have access to cash for two purp oses First it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House LCH In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater al to the LCH it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc ement action could ensue In addition it would be declared a defaulter and the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions Second it must be able to post margin to its clients A failure to make a contractu al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre d to the FSA A third potential use of cash is to make payments to inthe money clients in the event that they wish to close their account While th ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their marktomarket pr ofits the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest ions Previously we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity However ce rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from the rest of Enron has become a concern EML has or is in the process of l osing of unsecured LCs which were primarily used in lieu of c ash at the LCH EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC s Additionally a number of clients have requested that their accounts be transferred Those transfers have reduced EMLs cash balance Was the re maining mm unsecured LC which has been issued by a single bank to be withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid ity impact The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality Therefore we have agreed to start to do the following aChange the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t he rest of the enterprise bImprove our overall cash management function so as to have the control as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel cManage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints of continuing to do business on a normal basis dObtain financial information on a much more timely basis ePeriodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis Operational Risk In theory EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account s and rely on Enron Corp for the remaining portion of its day to day cash needs EMLs board have been resistant to this practice for several very p ractical reasons First it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis I f EML relied on Enron Corps daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp or an acco unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either capital or liquidity events as EMLs clearing account at Citibank would be substantially overdrawn Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi ght create a cascade for Enron EMLs board is reluctant to put that much f aith in the accuracy of our operational safeguards Capital As noted above EML is subject to the FSAs regulatory capital rules and mu st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis The FSA requires th at EML notify it if its capital base is less than of the minimum finan cial resources requirement For a variety of reasons there were occasions when EML violated the threshold on occasions in Because these v iolations were selfcontained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain s financial resources in excess of so that it has a sufficient buffer not to trigger the FSA notification requirement In the current climate the FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari se from Enrons perceived financial weakness Accordingly if one of those violations occurred today the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM Ls cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily basis EMLs board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev el of Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces s capital adequacy go hand in hand Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce narios which would cause liquidity issues for EML Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME brokers Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly Credit exposures leading to credit losses Recommendations The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov erall operational liquidity To fully draw down the remaining mm available under the mm s ubordinated facility To monetize the intercompany marked to market positions mm To increase the subordinated facility to mm and extend the maturi ty by six months to July To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi ts and other assets held by EML To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol d for calling margin To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients other th an a select group of key relationship clients To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c ompanies EMCL and EMCC therefore shifting the need for inventory finance Current Situation Unsecured Guaranty mm Secured Guaranty mm Subordinated Loans mm EML Cash Balance mm Cash required to replace Withdrawn guarantymm EML Regulatory Capital Level Excess Reg Capital over mm Conclusion The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress test ing The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we w ould have liquidity issues Given these possible eventualities we would ur ge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to comple ting point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

MingchengLian ManagerEGMFundamentals Dear Mr Lay My employment with Enron is to be terminated the reason given by HR for not meeting performance standards However I firmly believe that this is not the real reason the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager Mr Lowell BezanisManager EGM who I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me I have since filed a written complaint to Enrons EEO Committee This committee having investigated the case has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings As a consequence my reasonable request for a redeployment package has been rejected If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past years The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for days I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner unnecessarily since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife not only towards myself but also to other employees some of whom have left as a result in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability often receiving compliments from clients This cannot be the only way to solve this issue The Trigger and Retaliation Since Mr Bezanis has been my line manager internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me On August I attended a class of natural gas structuring Mr Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs however I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms Shanna Funkhouser my HR representative The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before MsFunkhouser Mr Bezanis and Mr Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered Feeling intimidated I requested that I meet with Ms Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO as agreed previously She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination Ms Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the midyear PRC process Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to reopen the past PRC cases I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

Government By Prem Shankar Jha Ever since the Vajpayees Government came to power more than two and a half years ago the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known In the nine months since December industrial growth has averaged per cent The decade when it averaged per cent and the months only five years ago when it touched per cent are now but a distant memory Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September terrorist strikes in the US It has now shrunk dramatically vehicle sales dropped by percent in September and colour TV sets registered a growth of a measly to per cent With no demand to power it inflation measured by the consumer price index has fallen almost to zero The share market is dead and there is no fresh investment Employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place however humble in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away By the number will have risen by another three million But Mr Yashwant Sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the countrys problems But one recent event highlights the governments paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do This is its failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the Maharashtra State Electricity Boardss attempt to foil Enrons bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement The London Court correctly maintained that just as a governments international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court The way has therefore been cleared for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations Given the fearsome proficiency of Enrons lawyers both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB will lose the case If that happens then by a conservative estimate India will have to pay around billion in costs and damages In addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase II of the project Thus in the end the project is likely to cost not billion but more like to billion For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a State Government and a private company and it had no say in the matter That pretext in any case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues But today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable let alone willing to pay such an enormous penalty So the bill will inevitably land at the Centres door And that means the taxpayers door The Centre will have no option but to pay But having done so will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government The answer obviously is no What it will be forced to do is transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete and operate But since no one can possibly run a billion power plant generating MW of power profitably the NTPC too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first Judging from the offers that the Tata Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply Company BSES were making to Enron the written down value will not exceed billion Thus whichever way we look at it the country will end by paying for a Dabholsize power plant billion without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else in return None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao government agreed to price its power on a costplus basis Nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning the latters inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future For better or for worse the Enron deal was struck and it was struck not once but twice As a serious responsible government that knows the importance of honouring ones word in a world where contract is king the Vajpayee Government must honour the countrys contractual obligations This does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhols power affordable are known to all As the Renegotiating Committee and the Godbole Committee recommended the Government should buy the million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast In fact it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant This is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need This will bring down the capital cost upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated to billion Second the Central Government should buy per cent of the equity in Dabhol from the promoters This was negotiated with the committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to billion The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate With the price of oil having fallen for India to around a barrel these changes will bring down the cost of Dabhols power at per cent capacity utilisation own to below Rs a unit This will make it entirely viable especially if Maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudorural sector The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the MSEB renegotiate it with Enron or if Enron wants to opt out then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the NTPC Getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhols power nor answer the more basic question how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity Copyrights The Hindu Republication or redissemination of the contents
