business into Enron I reported that we were aiming to complete the integration by the end of the year I am pleased to report that we are well on the way to meeting this target September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it bo th the colocation of the London and Tokyobased metals staff with Enrons offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals syste ms into our London headquarters took a tremendous amount of coordination by teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the integration team at Enron Europe Nevertheless DDay arrived with minimal problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of September th Another key
