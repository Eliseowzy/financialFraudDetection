October OnceMighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A OPPEL Jr OLEObj S time running out for Enron newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbENE At the beginning of this year the Enron Corporation the worlds dominant energy trader appeared unstoppable The companys decadelong effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington Its sales profits and stock were soaring And under the leadership of Jeffrey K Skilling its chief executive Enrons arrogance had grown even more quickly The company based in Houston dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets for electricity water and everything else Everyone would win under deregulation Enron said especially its shareholders whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets We are on the side of angels Mr Skilling said in March dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in Californias energy crisis People want to have open competitive markets They want fair competition Its the American way But less than a year later everybody seems to have lost especially Enrons investors Enrons stock is plunging and questions about its finances are mounting Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile In a worstcase outlook Enron could become the version of LongTerm Capital Management the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of Enrons shares have fallen more than percent this year erasing billion in shareholder value Enron closed on Friday at down cents after hitting a week low of earlier in the day The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulations basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market Enrons efforts to become a profitmaking water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures In August Mr Skilling quit forcing Kenneth L Lay his predecessor as chief executive and still Enrons chairman to resume daytoday control of the company The company declined to make senior executives including Mr Lay available for comment and asked that questions be submitted in writing Mr Skilling could not be reached Enrons problems boiled over earlier this month when it disclosed that its shareholders equity a measure of the companys value dropped by billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enrons regular financial statements The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the companys financial reporting and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas THE slump in the companys shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders equity On Wednesday the company forced out its chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow who is at the center of the controversy over Enrons confusing finances The company which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from Californias energy crisis today faces a potential cash crunch The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors smoldering concern about Enrons opaque financial statements Now with Wall Street analysts and bondrating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the companys profits Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash On Thursday the company drew down a billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbC and J P Morgan Chase which have each extended at least million But because of Enrons importance in the natural gas and electricity markets industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed because Enron is mainly a trader rather than a producer of energy But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices which have swung wildly in the last year Philip K Verleger Jr an energy markets economist emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the companys EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there are they good Are the firms hedges good Whats the situation Mr Verleger said Its got everyone scared In the short run Enrons credit rating may be its biggest problem If the companys rating falls below investment grade Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company A drop in the companys credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron hurting the companys sales and profits Enrons credit rating stands several notches above the critical point But its bonds which are publicly traded have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost percent comparable with many junk bonds Two of the three major creditrating agencies Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service have put Enrons bonds on review for possible downgrades The issue thats in the front of everybodys mind right now is credit said Mark Gurley senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbILA one of the nations largest energy traders Aquila is based in Kansas City Mo For now Aquila and other major energy traders and producers including Reliant Energy newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbREI the El Paso Corporation newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbEPG and Dynegy newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbDYN are continuing to do business with Enron And Mr Gurley said that Enrons own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of LongTerm Capital Management in They havent done anything tradingwise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down he said Still some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron especially longterm contracts They also said riskmanagement and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation Mark Palmer an Enron spokesman said on Friday that no energy trading company had stopped doing business with Enron He declined to say whether any of the companys trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront For years the details of Enrons finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company and to the investors who own its stock and bonds When Enrons profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements Now they do Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask To others in the industry the opaqueness of the companys financial statements parallels Enrons efforts to keep its energytrading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like LongTerm Capital Management they say that like the giant hedge fund Enron uses a lot of debt regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet With names like Marlin and Osprey the partnerships have at least billion in bonds outstanding backed by assets like a stake in Azurix newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbAZX Enrons water company subsidiary Enron has promised that if the partnerships debts exceed the value of their assets Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr Fastow who was chief financial officer when they were organized led to the billion writeoff in shareholders equity that Enron announced last week The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter after being criticized by shareholders In the process it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books reducing its shareholders equity by billion But because of complex accounting rules the transaction was not apparent in Enrons quarterly earnings report The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question When Enron released thirdquarter earnings on Oct it reported a loss from billion in writeoffs on failed investments The earnings statement did not mention the additional billion equity writedown But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable and its shares rose In a conference call with analysts after the announcement Mr Lay Enrons chairman also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity The reference was a brief one however and some listeners did not catch it Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done and many were confused by the accounting procedure Enrons stock began to slide and investors clamored for more information about the writeoff But so far the companys efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors Mr Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr Lays grasp of the situation They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals Mr Skilling and Mr Fastow have both left the company In an interview in late August Mr Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr Fastow In response to one question about them he said Youre getting way over my head Mr Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue saying Mr Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the SEC investigation There is not a whole lot we can say or should say about them Mr Palmer said He also said the company expected to generate about billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year In a conference call on Tuesday analysts pressed Mr Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write down and its other partnerships Instead they offered only vague explanations of the deal leaving Wall Street worried that more writeoffs might be coming David Fleischer a Goldman Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company was among those who came away concerned If Enron is unable to clarify its off balancesheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets he wrote in a research note after the call To try to reassure investors Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline its Internetbased trading exchange executed more than trades that day a higherthannormal volume We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community and were working on that Mr Lay said in a statement But in the meantime the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street Enrons stock tumbled almost percent Friday to its lowest levels in six years Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enrons off balancesheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston calculates that Enron may have close to billion in offbalancesheet debt She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about billion in foreign assets including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enrons problems and the souring economy As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs they may have to write those assets down Ms Coale said On Wednesday she downgraded her rating on Enron to sell from neutral The bottom line is its really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts Ms Coale said Shortsellers who attacked Enrons accounting even before the company disclosed the writeoff say the companys problems may run even deeper than analysts fear Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance moneylosing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business they say The company still isnt disclosing enough to know whether the core business the trading business is profitable said Mark Roberts director of research at Off Wall Street which recommended shorting Enrons stock on May when it stood at The issue remains why are they doing these transactions Our theory has been that the core operations arent that profitable James Chanos a leading short seller who has bet that Enrons stock will fall said Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits but hiding the losses when deals go against it Mr Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energytrading profits Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enrons positions Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset in roughly equivalent amounts by energy it has agreed to buy With these guys they tell us and all youve got is their word that theyre hedged said Mr Verleger the economist IN fact Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations Last year the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices Largescale energy trading has existed for only about a halfdozen years Enron pioneered the business and now dominates it accounting for about onequarter of all trading in the United States Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity a process that began in earnest a decade ago the power business was a simpler affair Utilities were given areas of monopoly service and their rates and ability to deliver enough electricity were overseen by state regulators But with the move to deregulate the business independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished providing an evergrowing portion of the nations power Beginning in the s the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated spurring Enron which used to be primarily a gaspipeline company to move into the trading business The companys shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mids with the ascension of Mr Skilling who became chief executive in February just six months before his unexpected resignation Underscoring the change in direction in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as security brokers dealers and flotation Before it had said it was in the business of wholesalepetroleum and petroleum products For most of its ascent Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure A year ago when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr Fastow the companys former chief financial officer analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr Fastows involvement Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its shortterm debt will have to be renegotiated next spring The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year unless Enron loses its investmentgrade credit rating before that ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enrons credit When LongTerm Capital was stumbling in some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought LongTerm owned trying to force LongTerm to sell its positions quickly and at a loss Something similar in energy markets might be possible If so Enron might find as LongTerm did that positions that should offset each other do not Enrons new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the companys profits are real and that its condition is better than the shortsellers believe As questions are answered confidence and the share price could rebound But for now investors are skittish and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enrons plight

Where Did the Value Go at Enron By FLOYD NORRIS OLEObj hat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbENE released its quarterly earnings a week ago Yesterday shares in Enron plunged to after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions The reaction was in some ways puzzling Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal it was likely that the SEC would begin a preliminary inquiry Whether it will go farther than that is not clear but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value to dribble out Enrons shares rose cents to last Tuesday as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement But since then they have fallen or percent The billion reduction in shareholders equity was not mentioned in a news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday It was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that wrongly thinking Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive was referring to a billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings release When questions were asked in the following days the explanations were less than thorough Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders equity was related to the termination of structured finance vehicles involving partnerships that had been controlled by the companys chief financial officer Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business said Ralph Pellecchia a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service He added that the issue of the companys credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its own Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports But last night it said Mr Lay would hold another conference call with investors at am today The companys earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many analysts They referred to such things as share settled costless collar arrangements and derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts The disclosures said the company entered into the transactions to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value The Wall Street Journal citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail One of the questions that the SEC may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings An SEC spokesman declined to comment Under accounting rules a companys transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses whatever the effect on cash flow So a company that sells its shares for each and buys them back at or at will report no earnings effect Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity and a related reduction in notes receivable is the result of Enrons termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods Stephen Moore an analyst with Moodys Investors Service who has put Enrons debt on review for a possible downgrade said that while some of the details were not clear Essentially Enrons promise was that a certain amount of Enrons shares would be worth billion The shares plummeted and they were not worth that much Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings which leaves out some expenses and directs attention away from its balance sheet which is disclosed only in SEC filings not in the earnings news release The reduction in shareholders equity would be shown only on the thirdquarter balance sheet which has yet to be released Earlier this year Jeffrey Skilling then Enrons chief executive reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners Mr Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr Lay the chairman and former chief executive took back the latter title While Enron was riding high its often difficulttounderstand reports were generally seen as not being a problem The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading and to be able to produce phenomenal profits When Mr Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administrations energy policies the aura was only enhanced In January the shares traded for But now with some of the companys ventures clearly having run into problems it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the companys reports That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer and some have wondered if there might have been similar deals with others Mr Lay has promised to make the companys financial reports easier to understand and last weeks report was at first praised by some analysts for doing just that In a news
