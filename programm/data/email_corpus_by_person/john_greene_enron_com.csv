<14258397.1075844486060.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.greene@enron.com,2000-09-26 07:51:00,Legal Authorization by Country for Enron Equity Trading in Europe Cc We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in trading We need to get rulings on shares futures and options for both exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country This research should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading in Australia Some of the countries involved may have already been green lighted a few years ago The countries we need to look into initially are Germany France Italy Norway Netherlands Spain United Kingdom Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary countries which include Austria Belgium Denmark Ireland Israel Sweden Switzerland Portugal Turkey I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments the principal booking entity is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled from the States Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would like to discuss issues associated with this request Thanks and regards John
<8010044.1075844486399.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.greene@enron.com,2000-09-25 13:32:00,Re Instinet and other platforms in the name of ENA or ECT Investments Inc Cc As ENA and ECT Investments Inc will be the entities where all trades are actually booked I would not think that any new agreements would need to be signed between the new agent entitiy and any outside vendors ie brokers online trading platforms etc The new entity will never take actual ownership of the securities Therefore I would presume that the Instinet agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation The PositITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States This agreement however should reflect exactly the same sort of structurelanguage as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA and ECT Investments Inc Please let me know your thoughts Thanks and regards John From Sara Shackleton on CDT To John CT cc Subject Instinet and other platforms in the name of ENA or ECT Investments Inc John Hi there As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes until the UK corporate agent is actuallly formed there is nothing further that I can do That formation should happen today or tomorrow With the actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments Inc I can provide that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are interested in transacting on Just FYI the Instinet people are merely waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed Please let me know if you have any further questions Sara
