Tax auditor today The auditor will submit two assessments Assets and Compressor Fuel Compressor fuel will be assessed but I believe the following are plausible arguments that might succeed and favorably adjust the estimated liability Plus Penalty Interest bii Purchase Price should be adjusted to reflect TWP as a market maker that could purchase natural gas lower than market could supply and transportation in San Juan Index Price should be MMBTU down from Avg MMBTU biii The correct tax rate would be not local tax should not be applicable Formal research is required Assuming MMBTU the original estimate k might be adjusted down to or as low as as follows Consumption MMBTU Price MMBTU Purchase Local Tax State Tax Total Tax Please call if you would like to meet and discuss this issue Dan Rittgers Ext Original Message From Rittgers Dan Sent Monday October PM To Geaccone Tracy Cc Hrna Sandra Subject FW Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN Account L Tracy I called the auditor last week following our conversation The auditor has not returned my call Field work is complete and no formal assessment has been issued I have unresolved issues which the auditor must consider before issuing the assessment In Summarizing our conversation last week I have not seen a preliminary assessment which I hoped would be coming in October During the auditors field audit the auditor proposed to assess tax on the following issues a Assets Purchase in Tax Penalty Interest I might protest almost all assessed amounts for this category b Expenses Compressor Fuel Estimate for audit Period Issues not resolved i My position is that no tax is due except for domestic fuel consumption ii If Compressor Fuel is taxable what is the Purchase Price iii Is the local tax applicable to Compressor Fuel iv Should tax be calculated prospectively rather than retroactively v If assessed Transwestern requests that the current regulation be revised to reflect a change for this issue Tariff may accommodate a pass through without a rate case I will provide a copy of the assessment for your records and subsequent consideration when available The auditor was promoted during my audit and is transition Considering this transition and my challenges response time is unpredictable Original Message From Chandler Bob Sent Tuesday August PM To Rittgers Dan Cc Geaccone Tracy Zahn Gary Subject FW

Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN Account L Tour Status and Protest COMPRESSOR FUEL So I cant tell what my exposure is here Which line do I use The maximum shown on the schedule is MM expand column width on Column A Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if to K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through However there could be Kmonth going forward The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP Whatever that may turn out to be it should not be an earnings concern but would be capitalized as part of the plant If you need more

Monday August AM To Petersen John Cc Russo Gavin Hrna Sandra Subject RE Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN Account L Tour Status and Protest COMPRESSOR FUEL John I have prepared a more formal

case which has my first priority jp From Rittgers DanSMTPDan NRONcom Sent Monday July PM To Petersen John Cc Russo Gavin Hrna Sandra Subject RE Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN Account L Tour Status and Protest File REGdocFile industrial usedoc The trip was very helpful for me as well I learned a lot from Terry the day before The decision to proceed further will not be my decision but I will prepare an internal analysis along three main points In preparing this internal analysis it would be helpful to know your Colorados position on the following issues ASSETSPURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT PSA Our original position related to the characterization of our purchase as the purchase of real property rather than TPP Regarding your acquiescence of the pipeline from the original jeopardy assessment under this argument thanks that is a big chunk of the original assessment My tentative concern under this argument is that foundation conduit wires pipe and valves remain on the schedule The compressor might be a bit more difficult to argue under this position Further Friday I submitted a copy of the Operating and Sale Agreement This agreement will further support my position that the PSA was not a purchase of TPP but was the purchase of a equity interest or right to the pipelines capacity Using this agreement my position is that the transaction is fully exempt as provided by Reg SEE Regdoc ATTACHED It says Tangible personal property does not include intangible personal property constituting mere rights of action Transwestern is acquiring a right to capacity on the pipeline as stipulated under the terms of Exhibit C Given the Operating and Sale Agreement do you see this as a viable conclusion If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp I might agree But the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash COMPRESSOR FUELDOMESTIC FUEL Ill get the Compressor and domestic consumption numbers soon and the price will be determined a little later There are separate meters for measuring Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption Friday I submitted my tax exempt position for Compressor Fuel consumed for Gas Services SEE industrial usedoc BELOW I dont believe that the statute and regulation support that position Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service to qualify for the exemption I dont believe it does I definitely need more research on this PENALTY INTEREST I will be requesting a waiver of penalty and interest on any assessment The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level Original Message From Petersen John mailto Sent Monday July AM To Rittgers Dan Subject RE Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN Account L Tour Status and Protest Dan Good morning Thanks for the tour of the La Plata Facility It was very helpful Ill remove the for the pipe x from the proposed taxable amount Everything else Ill keep as previously determined unless I receive additional information from you Also I look forward to receiving the gas consumed figures for both domestic use which I understand is taxable and the compressor use which remains unagreed If you have a proposal for the valuation of the gas consumed that would be helpful also Thanks again for the tour and
