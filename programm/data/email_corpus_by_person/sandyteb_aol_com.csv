which Im going to do also Love S Inline attachment follows From To sandy taylor Date Monday October GMT Subject Hi Sandy I am passing this on to friends Joan Stan Goff is a former US Special Forces Master Sergeant He has been listed as an enemy of America for daring to question what Americans have been told about the World Trade attack and for participating in a teachin at Chapel Hill North Carolina on the of September Here is his own words the domestic repression has already begun officially and unofficially Its kind of a latter day McCarthyism I participated in a teachin at Chapel Hill North Carolina on the th of September and though not a single person on the panel excused or justified the attacks and every person there offered either condolences and prayers for the victims we were excoriated within two days as enemies of America Yesterday an oped called for my deportation to where one can only guess Now Herr Ashcroft is fast tracking the biggest abrogation of US civil liberties since the socalled antiterrorism legislation after the Oklahoma City bombing What they are doing is very very dangerous by Stan Goff Im a retired Special Forces Master Sergeant That doesnt cut much for those who will only accept the opinions of former officers on military matters since we enlisted swine are assumed to be incapable of grasping the nuances of doctrine But I wasnt just in the army I studied and taught military science and doctrine I was a tactics instructor at the Jungle Operations Training Center in Panama and I taught Military Science at West Point And contrary to the popular image of what Special Forces does SFs mission is to teach We offer advice and assistance to foreign forces Thats everything from teaching marksmanship to a private to instructing a Battalion staff on how to coordinate effective air operations with a sister service Based on that experience and operations in eight designated conflict areas from Vietnam to Haiti I have to say that the story we hear on the news and read in the newspapers is simply not believable The most cursory glance at the verifiable facts before during and after September th does not support the official line or conform to the current actions of the United States government But the official line only works if they can get everyone to accept its underlying premises Im not at all surprised about the Republican and Democratic Parties repeating these premises They are simply two factions within a single dominant political class and both are financed by the same economic powerhouses My biggest disappointment as someone who identifies himself with the left has been the tacit acceptance of those premises by others on the left sometimes naively and sometimes to score some morality points Those premises are twofold One there is the premise that what this de facto administration is doing now is a response to September th Two there is the premise that this attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was done by people based in Afghanistan In my opinion neither of these is sound To put this in perspective we have to go back not to September th but to last year or further A man of limited intelligence George W Bush with nothing more than his name and the behindthescenes pressure of his powerful fathera former President exdirector of Central Intelligence and an oil manis systematically constructed as a candidate at tremendous cost Across the country subtle and notsosubtle mechanisms are put into place to disfranchise a significant fraction of the Democrats AfricanAmerican voter base This doesnt come out until Florida becomes a battleground for Electoral College votes and the magnitude of the story has been suppressed by the corporate media to this day In a decision so lacking in legitimacy the Supreme Court will neither byline the author of the decision nor allow the decision to ever be used as a precedent Bush v Gore awards the presidency of the United States to a man who loses the popular vote in Florida and loses the national popular vote by over This de facto regime then organizes a very interesting cabinet The Vice President is an oil executive and the former Secretary of Defense The National Security Advisor is a director on the board of a transnational oil corporation and a Russia scholar The Secretary of State is a man with no diplomatic experience whatsoever and the former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff The other interesting appointment is Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is the former CEO of Searle Pharmaceuticals He and Cheney were featured as speakers at the May RussianAmerican Business Leaders Forum So the consistent currents in this cabinet are petroleum the former Soviet Union and the military Based on the record of Daddy Bush in all his guises and the general trajectory of US foreign policy as far back as the Carter Administration I feel I can reasonably conclude that Middle Eastern and South Asian fossil fuels are one of their major preoccupations Not just because this klavern has some very direct financial interests in fossil fuel but because they surely know that worldwide oil production is peaking as we speak and will soon begin a permanent and precipitous decline that will completely change the character of civilization as we know it within years Even the left seems to be in deep denial about this but the math is available And no alternative energies and energy technologies will not save us All the alternatives in the world can not begin to provide more than a tiny fraction of the energy base now provided by oil This makes it more than a resource and the drive to control whats left more than an economic competition I further conclude that the economic colonization of the former Soviet Union is probably high on that agenda and in fact has a powerful synergy with the issue of petroleum Russia not only holds vast untapped resources that beckon to imperialism in crisis it remains a credible military and nuclear challenger in the region We have not one but three members of the Bush de facto cabinet with military credentials which makes the cabinet look quite a lot like a military General Staff All this way before September th Then theres the subject of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO might have expected consignment to the dustbin of the Cold War after the Eastern Bloc shattered in Peace dividend and all that But it didnt It expanded directly into the former states of the Eastern Bloc toward the former Soviet Union and contributed significant forces to the devastation of Iraqa key country in the world oil market over which control translates into the ability to manipulate oil prices NATO is a military formation and the United States exerts the controlling interest in it It seemed like a form without a function but it remedied that pretty quickly Then when Yugoslavia refused to play ball with the International Monetary Fund the US and Germany began a systematic campaign of destabilization there even using some of the veterans of Afghanistan in that campaign NATO became the military arm of that agendathe breakup of Yugoslavia into compliant statelets the further containment of the former Soviet Union and the future pipeline easement for Caspain Sea oil to Western European markets through Kosovo You see this is important to understand and peopleeven those against the war talkare tending to overlook the significance of it NATO is not a guarantor of international law and it is not a humanitarian organization It is a military alliance with one very dominant partner And it can no longer claim to be a defensive alliance against European socialists It is an instrument of military aggression NATO is the organization that is now going to thrust further along the th parallel from the Balkans through the Southern Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union The US military has already taken control of a base in Uzbekistan No one is talking about how what we are doing seems to be a very logical extension of a strategy that was already in motion and has been in motion for two decades Once we recognize the pattern of activity designed to simultaneously consolidate control over Middle Eastern and South Asian oil and contain and colonize the former Soviet Union Afghanistan is exactly where they need to go to pursue that agenda Afghanistan borders Iran India and even China but more importantly the Central Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and Tajikistan These border Kazakhstan Kazakhstan borders Russia Turkmenistan sits on the Southeastern quadrant of the Caspian Sea whose oil the Bush Administration dearly covets Afghanistan is necessary for two things as a base of operations to begin the process of destabilizing breaking off and establishing control over the South Asian Republics which will begin within the next months in my opinion and constructing a pipeline through Turkmenistan Afghanistan and Pakistan to deliver petroleum to the Asian market The BBC was recently told by Niaz Naik a Pakistani Foreign Secretary that senior American officials were warning them as early as midJuly that military action for midOctober was being planned for Afghanistan In the Department of Energy was issuing reports on the desirability of a pipeline through Afghanistan and in Unocal testified before the House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific that this pipeline was crucial to transport Caspian Basin oil to the Indian Ocean Given this evidence that a military operation to secure at least a portion of Afghanistan has been on the table possibly as early as five years ago I cant help but conclude that the actions we are seeing put into motion now are part of a preSeptember th agenda Im absolutely sure of that in fact The planning alone for operations of this scale that are now taking shape would take many months And we are seeing them take shape in mere weeks It defies common sense This administration is lying about this whole thing being a reaction to September th That leads me in short order to be very suspicious of their yettobeprovided evidence that someone in Afghanistan is responsible Its just too damn convenient Which also leads me to wonderjust for the sake of knowingwhat actually did happen on September th and who actually is responsible The socalled evidence is a farce The US presented Tony Blairs puppet government with the evidence and of the socalled points of evidence only nine even referred to the attacks on the World Trade Center and those points were conjectural This is a bullshit story from beginning to end Presented with the available facts any year old with a liking for courtroom dramas could tear this story apart like a twodollar shirt But our corporate press regurgitates it uncritically But then as we should know by now their role is to legitimize This cartoon heavy theyve turned bin Laden into makes no sense when you begin to appreciate the complexity and synchronicity of the attacks As a former military person whos been involved in the development of countless operations orders over the years I can tell you that this was a very sophisticated and costly enterprise that would have left what we call a huge signature In other words it would be very hard to effectively conceal So theres a real question about why there was no warning of this That can be a question about the efficacy of the governments intelligence apparatus That can be a question about various policies in the various agencies that had to be duped to orchestrate this action And it can also be a question about whether or not there was foreknowledge of the event and that foreknowledge is being covered up To dismiss this concern out of hand as the rantings of conspiracy nuts is premature And there is a history of this kind of thing being done by national political bosses including the darling of liberals Franklin Roosevelt The evidence is very compelling that the Roosevelt Administration deliberately failed to act to stop Pearl Harbor in order to mobilize enough national anger to enter the World War II I have no idea why people arent asking some very specific questions about the actions of Bush and company on the day of the attacks Follow along Four planes get hijacked and deviate from their flight plans all the while on FAA radar The planes are all hijacked between and AM Eastern Daylight Time Who is notified This is an event already that is unprecedented But the President is not notified and going to a Florida elementary school to hear children read By around AM it should be very apparent that something is terribly wrong The President is gladhanding teachers By when American Airlines Flight crashes into the World Trade Center Bush is settling in with children for his photo ops at Booker Elementary Four planes have obviously been hijacked simultaneously an event never before seen in history and one has just dived into the worlds best know twin towers and still no one notifies the nominal Commander in Chief No one has apparently scrambled any Air Force interceptors either At United Flight crashes into the remaining World Trade Center building At Andrew Card the Presidential Chief of Staff whispers to George W Bush Bush briefly turns somber according to reporters Does he cancel the school visit and convene an emergency meeting No He resumes listening to second graders read about a little girls pet fucking goat and continues this banality even as American Airlines Flight conducts an unscheduled point turn over Ohio and heads in the direction of Washington DC Has he instructed Chief of Staff Card to scramble the Air Force No An excruciating minutes later he finally deigns to give a public statement telling the United States what they already have figured out that theres been an attack by hijacked planes on the World Trade Center Theres a hijacked plane beelining to Washington but has the Air Force been scrambled to defend anything yet No At when he makes his announcement American Flight is still ten minutes from its target the Pentagon The Administration will later claim they had no way of knowing that the Pentagon might be a target and that they thought Flight was headed to the White House but the fact is that the plane has already flown South and past the White House nofly zone and is in fact tearing through the sky at over nauts At this plane conducts another turn degrees over the Pentagon all the while being tracked by radar and the Pentagon is not evacuated and there are still no fastmovers from the Air Force in the sky over Alexandria and DC Now the real kicker A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a Florida puddlejumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas conducts a wellcontrolled downward spiral descending the last feet in twoandahalf minutes brings the plane in so low and flat that it clips the electrical wires across the street from the Pentagon and flies it with pinpoint accuracy into the side of this building at nauts When the theory about learning to fly this well at the puddlejumper school began to lose ground it was added that they received further training on a flight simulator This is like saying you prepared your teenager for her first drive on I at rush hour by buying her a video driving game Its horse shit There is a story being constructed about these events My crystal ball is not working today so I cant say why But at the least this socalled CommanderinChief and his staff that we are all supposed to follow blindly into some illdefined war on terrorism is criminally negligent or unspeakably stupid And at the worst if more is known or was known and there is an effort to conceal the facts there is a criminal conspiracy going on Certainly the Bush de facto administration was facing a confluence of crises from which they were temporarily rescued by this event Whether they played a sinister role or not there is little doubt that they have at the very least opportunistically pounced on this attack to overcome their lack of legitimacy to shift the blame for the encroaching recession from capitalism to the September th terror attack to legitimize their preexisting foreign policy agenda and to establish and consolidate repressive measures domestically and silence dissent In many ways September th pulled the Bush cookies out of the fire And given them the green light to begin constructing a longterm scenario within which to establish fascistic control measures at home and abroad as a citadel for the ruling class in the catastrophic conjuncture that we are entering based on the end of oil This elephant in the living room is being studiously ignored In fact the domestic repression has already begun officially and unofficially Its kind of a latter day McCarthyism I participated in a teachin at Chapel Hill North Carolina on the th of September and though not a single person on the panel excused or justified the attacks and every person there offered either condolences and prayers for the victims we were excoriated within two days as enemies of America Yesterday an oped called for my deportation to where one can only guess Now Herr Ashcroft is fast tracking the biggest abrogation of US civil liberties since the socalled antiterrorism legislation after the Oklahoma City bombingwhich by the way hasnt resulted in antiterrorism but in the acceleration of the application of the racist death penalty The FBI has defined terrorist groups not by whether any given group has ever acted as terrorists but by their beliefs Some socialists and antiglobalization groups have already been identified by name as terrorist groups even though there is not a single shred of evidence that they have ever participated in any criminal activity It reminds me of the Smith Act that was finally declared unconstitutional but only after a hell of a lot of people served a hell of a long time in jail for the crime of thinking I think this also points to yet another huge problems that the Bush regime was facing Worldwide resistance to the whole socalled neoliberal agenda which is a prettied up term for debtleverage imperialism While debt and the threat of sanctions has been used to coerce nations in the periphery we have to understand that the final guarantor of compliance remains military action For a global economic agenda there is always a corresponding political and military agenda The focal point of these actions in the short term is Southern Asia but they have already scripted this as a worldwide and protracted fight against terrorism Its far better than drug wars as a rationalization and the drug war thing was being discredited in any case Leftists are regaining power and popularity in Venezuela El Salvador Nicaragua Ecuador Colombia the Dominican Republic Haiti Brazil and Argentina Cuba has gained immense prestige over the last few years The empire is beginning to unravel We can hardly justify intervention in these places by saying they are not towing the economic line by allowing the absolute domination of their societies by transnational corporations That exposes the agenda So we simply claim they are supporting terrorism Its for all these reasons I say the left has missed the boat on this one by allowing them to get away with rushing past the question of who did what on September th If the official story is a lie and I think the circumstantial case is strong enough to stay with this question then we really do need to know what happened And we need to understand concretely what the motives of this administration are And we need to understand more than just their immediate motives but where the larger social forces that underwrite our situation right now are headed I do not think this administration is engaged in the deliberative process of a political grouping that is on top of their game They are putting together some very deliberative technical solutions in response to a larger situation that it slipping rapidly out of their control Like clear cutting Theres a very smart technology being employed to do a very dumb thing What they are responding to is not September th but the beginning of a permanent and precipitous decline in worldwide oil production the beginning of a deep and protracted worldwide recession and the unraveling of the empire This brings me to a point about what all this means for Americans security which they are perfectly justified to worry about The actions being prepared by this administration will not only not enhance our security it will significantly degrade it Military action against many groups across the globe which is what the administration is telling us quite openly they are planning to do will put a lot of backs against the wall That cant be very secure The concept of war being touted here is a violation of the principles of war on several counts and will inevitably lead to military catastrophes if youre inclined to view this from a position of moral and political neutrality And the people who are now in possession of half the worlds remaining oil reserves are subject to destabilization for which we cant even pretend to predict the consequencesbut loss of access to critical energy supplies is certainly within the realm of possibility Worst of all we will be destabilizing Pakistan a nuclear power in an active conflict with its neighbor and we will be provoking Russia another nuclear power The security stakes dont get any higher and Americans can ill afford to ignore nukes And I think that this domestic agenda is a tremendous threat to the security of anyone who is critical of the government or their corporate financiers and we already know that the real threats are against populations that can easily be scapegoated as the domestic crisis deepens There is a very real threat right now of creeping fascism in this country and that phenomenon requires its domestic enemies Historically those enemies have included leftists trade unionists and racially and nationally oppressed sectors This whole state of emergency mentality is already being used to quiet the public discourses of antiracism of feminism of environmentalism and of both socialism and anarchism And while there is token resistance by officials to antiMuslim xenophobia the stereotypical images have saturated the media and the government is already beginning to openly reinstate racial profiling It is only a short step from there to go after other groups We have long been prepared by the ideologies of overt and covert racism and racism as both institution and corresponding psychology in the United States is nearly intractable Its for all these reason I say emphatically that we can not accept anything from this administration not their policies nor their bullshit stories What they are doing is very very dangerous and the time to fight back against them openly is right now before they can consolidate their power and their agenda Once they have done that our job becomes much more difficult The left if it has the capacity to selforganize out of its oblivion needs to understand its critical roles here We have to play the role of credible hardworking and nonsectarian partners in a broader peacemovement We have to study synthesize and describe our current historical conjuncture And we have to prepare leadership for the decisive conflict that will emerge to first defeat fascism then take political power Rosa Luxemburgs words are truer than ever right now We are not faced with a choice between socialism and capitalism but socialism or barbarism And what we can least afford are denial and timidity Stan Goff

and DC Ive only just now read it Sandy Inline attachment follows From To Date Monday September GMT Subject Print and read Whereas it is not sensational like mainstream news it is however the stark reality of the ebb and flow of energy prices Sorry alarmists and politicians The laws of economics are nearly as sure as the law of gravity September Where Did the Energy Crisis Go by Jerry Taylor and Peter VanDoren Jerry Taylor is director of naturalresources studies at the Cato Institute Peter VanDoren is editor of Catos Regulation What a difference a few months make Last spring President Bush and politicians far and wide warned that a long dark energy night would descend across America unless we adopt some sort of comprehensive national energy plan While the policy prescriptions offered by Democrats and Republicans of course differed both liberals and conservatives were convinced that markets were broken and only a muscular intervention by the federal government could get us out of Carterville But alas the energy crisis that loomed so large only a few months ago disappeared this summer like a shimmering mirage on the horizon of a political desert As some of you may have noticed energy prices dropped a whopping percent in July the steepest decline since April Gasoline prices dropped an even more stunning percent Energy gluts and declining profit margins are causing investors to freeze or even cancel energy infrastructure projects that looked so promising but a few months ago Forgive us if we gloat but we told you so There is not and never was an energy crisis Supplies were not and are not running dry Markets were not and are not broken Regulations have not strangled the industry What happened then First the economy slowed down Second political and ideological gridlock prevented politicians and regulators from doing much harm while the markets did that supply and demand voodoo that they do so well Now for the details On the electricity front the western power crisis was sparked primarily by a massive increase in natural gas prices That increase in turn was triggered by a drought which reduced the output from dams and thus increased the demand on gasfired generators unseasonable weather increasing home cooling and then home heating demand historically low levels of natural gas inventories percent below the fiveyear average in February and bottlenecks in the pipeline system that kept gas suppliers from meeting local demand This summer naturalgas prices have returned almost to precrisis levels which have in turn reduced electricity prices almost to precrisis levels One reason that supplies are ample is because natural gas inventories are now higher than usual In fact the scarcity last winter was somewhat due to the competition between summertime demand buyers looking to stockpile natural gas to replenish inventories and thenandnow wintertime demand Summertime demand won Another reason that natural gas supplies are robust is because North American production is up even without access to additional federal lands US domestic production has increased about percent over a year ago while Canadian production is up percent which may not sound like a lot to you but those are big numbers in the energy industry A secondary cause of the power crisis was the large number of gasfired generators that were down for repairs last winter As much as a third of the states generating capacity was offline at any given time during the worst of the crisis The maintenance backlog from last summer is now over and a large amount of generating capacity has returned to the market Most newspaper stories tell us that an important reason for the spectacular electricity price drop is a spectacular drop in demand True Electricity use in the areas served by the California Independent System Operator is percent lower through July than the first months of These newspaper stories then go on to tell us that one of the main reasons for the drop in demand has been unseasonably cool weather False If you examine the number of cooling degree days in California the difference between the average daily temperature and degrees and weight those figures by population youll find that temperatures through July where most Californians live are actually percent warmer than last year The drop in electricity demand is actually something of a mystery Some of it is almost certainly due to the retail electricity price increases imposed in California this summer but some of it is also probably due to the crisis mentality that has gripped the state Once Californians accepted that the scarcity was real and that it could get even worse conservation kicked in beyond what prices alone might have delivered And some of it can be attributed to the slowing economy and the slumping dotcom sector in particular No one knows however exactly how much each of these events contributed to the drop in demand The gasoline story is however a lot simpler The widespread warnings of a gallon gasoline were about what might happen if a key refinery or two blew up or if a key pipeline or two ruptured unexpectedly Such things are indeed possible in fact a fire on August at a Citgo refinery in Lemont Illinois has increased Midwestern gasoline prices by cents per gallon in the last two weeks but they dont happen all the time And they didnt happen in large part this summer Unfortunately most people missed the qualifications in the midst of the panic and braced themselves for a storm that was never sited in the first place When gasoline prices went up this spring people bought less gasoline And while its true that no new refinery has been built in the United States in about years theres still room to increase production from existing refineries when profit opportunities present themselves as they did for a change this summer Moreover foreign refineries for the first time in memory found it profitable to produce significant amounts of America gasoline for export And what do you know prices have been dropping steadily since Memorial Day The moral of the story is that markets arent broke when prices spike Theyre working fine theyre just not delivering news that consumers or politicians are wild about hearing But no matter how unpleasant price spikes are in the short term theyre absolutely necessary to remedy the underlying economic problems For those of you who either forgot your introductory economics or have simply spent too much time reading the oped pages a practice which can dull the mind heres how it generally works On the supply side high prices high profits increased investment increased supply declining prices On the demand side high prices reduced demand declining prices While its no surprise that liberals find such market success stories a constant revelation the real surprise is that the ostensibly hardright Bush administration had such little faith in a freemarket system its constantly praising When the Presidents chief economics advisor Larry Lindsey was asked by the Washington Post a day after the administrations energy plan was released whether Cato was right to argue that markets alone could and would alleviate energy shortages without any additional federal intervention Mr Lindsey said I dont think so Well think again Mr Lindsey Price hikes may come and go but the invisible hand never takes a vacation This article was first published in National Review Online September

Sandy Taylor Robin Carol Dane Ellen Sheehan Date Wednesday January GMT Subject This is really pretty funny A Cats Tale This is the story of the night my tenyearold cat Rudy got his head stuck in the garbage disposal I knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived so let me tell you right up front that hes fine Getting him out wasnt easy though and the process included numerous home remedies a plumber two cops an emergency overnight veterinary clinic a case of mistaken identity five hours of panic and fifteen minutes of fame First some background My husband Bill and I had just returned from a fiveday springbreak vacation in the Cayman Islands where I had been sick as a dog the whole time trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy it was better to do it in paradise We had arrived home at PM a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems I still had illnessrelated vertigo and because of the flight delays had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at the next morning I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams and around ten oclock I heard Bill hollering something undecipherable from the kitchen As I raced out to see what was wrong I saw Bill frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy or rather Rudys headless body scrambling around in the sink his claws clicking in panic on the metal Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal and when he left the room Rudy whom we always did call a pinhead had gone in after it It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side and who now looked like a desperate furcovered turkey carcass set to defrost in the sink while its still alive and kicking It was also disturbing to see Bill Mr CalminanyEmergency at his wits end trying to soothe Rudy trying to undo the garbage disposal failing at both and basically freaking out Adding to the chaos was Rudys twin brother Lowell also upset racing around in circles jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudys butt for comfort and biting it out of fear Clearly I had to do something First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck We tried Johnsons baby shampoo kept on hand for my nieces visits and butterflavored Crisco both failed and a nowgreasy Rudy kept struggling Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal which was a good idea but he couldnt do it Turns out the thing is constructed like a metal onion you peel off one layer and another one appears with Rudys head still buried deep inside stuck in a hard plastic collar My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy trying to calm him with the room spinning vertigo Lowell howling hes part Siamese and Bill clattering around with tools When all our efforts failed we sought professional help I called our regular plumber who actually called me back quickly even at oclock at night thanks Dave He talked Bill through further layers of disposal dismantling but still we couldnt reach Rudy I called the number for Insinkerator no response a pest removal service that advertises hour service no response an allnight emergency veterinary clinic who had no experience in this matter and so no advice and finally in desperation I could see that Rudys normally pink paw pads were turning blue The fire department I figured gets cats out of trees maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen This suggestion gave me pause Im from the sixties and even if I am currently a fine upstanding citizen I had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house on purpose I resisted the suggestion but the dispatcher was adamant Theyll help you out he said The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice More importantly they were also able to think rationally which we were not They were of course quite astonished by the situation Ive never seen anything like this Officer Mike kept saying The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a firstname basis with our cops Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight I have had cats all my life he said comfortingly Also he had an idea Evidently we needed a certain tool a tiny circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudys neck without hurting Rudy and Officer Tom happened to own one I live just five minutes from here he said Ill go get it He soon returned and the three of them Bill and the two policemen got under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal I sat on the counter holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surrealness of the scene with the weird middleofthenight lighting the rooms occasional spinning Lowells spooky sound effects an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it One good thing came of this the guys did manage to get the bottom of the disposal so we could now see Rudys face and knew he could breathe But they couldnt cut the flange without risking the cat Stumped Officer Tom had another idea You know he said I think the reason we cant get him out is the angle of his head and body If we could just get the sink out and lay it on its side Ill bet we could slip him out That sounded like a good idea at this point ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends he knew how to take out the sink Again they went to work the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an everincreasing pile of tools and sink parts They cut the electrical supply capped off the plumbing lines unfastened the metal clamps unscrewed all the pipes and about an hour later voila The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop with one guy holding the garbage disposal which contained Rudys head up close to the sink which contained Rudys body We laid the sink on its side but even at this more favorable removal angle Rudy stayed stuck Officer Toms radio beeped calling him away on some kind of real police business As he was leaving though he had another good idea You know he said I dont think we can get him out while hes struggling so much We need to get the cat sedated If he were limp we could slide him out And off he went regretfully a cat lover still worried about Rudy The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea but Bill and I were new to the area We knew that the overnight emergency veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away but we didnt know exactly how to get there I know where it is declared Officer Mike Follow me So Mike got into his patrol car Bill got into the drivers seat of our car and I got into the back carrying the kitchen sink what was left of the garbage disposal and Rudy It was now about am We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudys face hoping I could comfort him Instead my sweet gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger hard really hard and wouldnt let go My scream reflex kicked into gear and I couldnt stop the noise Bill slammed on the breaks hollering What What happened Should I stop checking us out in the rear view mirror No I managed to get out between screams just keep driving Rudys biting me but weve got to get to the vet Just go Bill turned his attention back to the road where Officer Mike took a turn we hadnt expected and we followed After a few minutes Rudy let go and as I stopped screaming I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park in and out of empty parking lots past little streets that didnt look at all familiar Wheres he taking us I asked We should have been there ten minutes ago Bill was as mystified as I was but all we knew to do was follow the police car until finally he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him As Bill rolled down the window to ask Mike where are we going the cop who was not Mike rolled down his window and asked Why are you following me Once Bill and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked led us quickly to the emergency vet where Mike greeted us by holding open the door exclaiming Where were you guys It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us because we hadnt thought to call and warn them about what was coming Clearly by this time we werent really thinking at all We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head and the clinic staff was ready They took his temperature which was down degrees and his oxygen level which was half of normal and the vet declared This cat is in serious shock Weve got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock the vet said grimly We dont have a choice With that he injected the cat Rudy went limp and the vet squeezed about half a tube of KY jelly onto the cats neck and pulled him free Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode I know this from watching a lot of ER They laid Rudy on a cart where one person hooked up IV fluids another put little socks on his paws Youd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads she said one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket and another took a blowdryer to warm up Rudys now very gunky head The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there limp and motionless At this point they sent Bill Mike and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life I told Mike he didnt have to stay but he just stood there shaking his head Ive never seen anything like this he said again At about AM the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery They needed to keep Rudy overnight to rehydrate him and give him something for the brain swelling they assumed he had but if all went well we could take him home the following night Just in time to hear the good news Officer Tom rushed in finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy I figured that once this ordeal was over and Rudy was home safely I would have to rethink my position on the police Bill and I got back home about We hadnt unpacked from our trip I was still intermittently dizzy and I still hadnt prepared my class I need a vacation I said and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class Bill made us a pitcher of martinis I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudys condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang Hi this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown TimesHerald a voice told me Listen I was just going through the police blotter from last night Mostly its the usual stuff Breaking and entering petty theft but theres this one item Um do you have a cat So I told Steve the whole story which interested him A couple hours later he called back to say that his editor was interested too did I have a picture of Rudy The next day Rudy was frontpage news under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article Mr Huskey had somehow inferred that I called because I thought Bill my husband was going into shock although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue I dont quite understand So the first thing I had to do was call Bill at work Bill who had worked tirelessly to free Rudyand swear that I had been misquoted When I arrived at work myself I was famous people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudys health When I called our regular vet whom I had met only once to make a followup appointment for Rudy the receptionist asked Is this the famous Rudys mother When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later Dave my mechanic said We read about your cat Is he OK When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal And when I went to get my hair cut the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper about a cat that got stuck in the garbage disposal Even today over a year later people ask about Rudy whom a yearold neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to climb on the roof of her house and peer in the secondstory window at her I dont know what the moral of this story is but I do know that this adventure cost me in emergency vet bills followup vet care a new sink new plumbing new electrical wiring and a new garbage disposal one with a cover The vet can no longer say hes seen everything but the kitchen sink I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store but was told that they couldnt accept gifts that I would put them in a bad position if I tried So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent individual thankyou notes to Tom and Mike complete with pictures of Rudy so they could see what he looks like with his head on And Rudy whom we originally got for free or so we thought still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and unaccountably he still sometimes prowls the sink hoping for fish
<23416989.1075861148112.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sandyteb@aol.com,2002-01-15 04:21:06,Cat TaleI forwarded this to a number of people yesterday but most didnt get it so Im sending again Its long so you may want to print out and read later Love S A Cats Tale This is the story of the night my tenyearold cat Rudy got his head stuck in the garbage disposal I knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived so let me tell you right up front that hes fine Getting him out wasnt easy though and the process included numerous home remedies a plumber two cops an emergency overnight veterinary clinic a case of mistaken identity five hours of panic and fifteen minutes of fame First some background My husband Bill and I had just returned from a fiveday springbreak vacation in the Cayman Islands where I had been sick as a dog the whole time trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy it was better to do it in paradise We had arrived home at PM a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems I still had illnessrelated vertigo and because of the flight delays had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at the next morning I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams and around ten oclock I heard Bill hollering something undecipherable from the kitchen As I raced out to see what was wrong I saw Bill frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy or rather Rudys headless body scrambling around in the sink his claws clicking in panic on the metal Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal and when he left the room Rudy whom we always did call a pinhead had gone in after it It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side and who now looked like a desperate furcovered turkey carcass set to defrost in the sink while its still alive and kicking It was also disturbing to see Bill Mr CalminanyEmergency at his wits end trying to soothe Rudy trying to undo the garbage disposal failing at both and basically freaking out Adding to the chaos was Rudys twin brother Lowell also upset racing around in circles jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudys butt for comfort and biting it out of

Rights in Afghanistan Original message text Madu the government of Afghanistan is waging a war upon women Since the Taliban took power in women have had to wear burqua and have been beaten and stoned in public for not having the proper attire even if this not having the mesh covering in front of their eyes One woman was beaten to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists for accidentally exposing her arm while she was driving Another was stoned to death for trying to leave the country with a man that was not a relative Women are not allowed to work or even go out in public without a male relative professional women such as professors translatorsdoctors lawyers artists and writers have been forced from their jobs Homes where a woman is present must have their windows painted so that she can never be seen by outsiders They must wear silent shoes so that they are never heard Women live in fear of their lives for the slightest misbehavior Because they cant work those without male relatives or husbands are either starving to death or begging on the street even if they hold PhDs Depression is becoming so widespread that it has reached emergency levels There is no way in such an extreme Islamic society to know the suicide rate with certainty but relief workers are estimating that the suicide rate among women is very high There are no proper medication and treatment for severe depression and would rather take their lives than live in such conditions has increased significantly There are almost no medical facilities available for women At one of the rare hospitals for women a reporter found still nearly lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of beds unwilling to speak eat or do anything but slowly wasting away Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners perpetually rocking or crying most of them in fear One doctor is considering when the little medication that is left finally runs out leaving these women in front of the presidents residence as a form of protest It is at the point where the term human rights violations has become an understatement Husbands have the power of life and death over their women relatives especially their wives but an angry mob has just as much right to stone or beat a woman often to death for exposing an inch of flesh or offending them in the slightest way Women enjoyed relative freedom to work dress generally as they wanted and drive and appear in public alone until only The rapidity of this transition is the main reason for the depression and suicide women who were once educators or doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as subhuman in the name of rightwing fundamentalist Islam It is not their tradition or culture but it is alien to them and it is extreme even for those cultures where fundamentalism is the rule Everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence even if they are women in a Muslim country If we can threaten military force in Kosovo in the name of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians citizens of the world can certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression murder and injustice committed against women by the Taliban STATEMENT In signing this we agree that the current treatment of women in Afghanistan is completely UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the United Nations and that the current situation overseas will not be tolerated Womens Rights is not a small issue anywhereand it is UNACCEPTABLE for women to be treated as unhuman and so much as property Equality and human decency is a RIGHT not a freedom either

left around stopped in at Depot Square ofc but didnt stay long Picked up two pieces of reduced pizza at Pine did I tell you the owners sold it to someone from NY bought a few items at Maggies and then drove home Peterborough was almost deserted because of the impending storm Lorraine called me at the Depot Square office to say that work had been called off for tomorrow so I dont even have to think about trying to get plowedsnowblowed out until Wednesday It has been snowing steadily for most of the day but not huge accumulation yetfew inches But predictions are for continual snowfall and strong winds tonight Ive filled some large containers with water have brought firewood in and even put some in basement although I really should get more before it gets dark as Im not sure this will last until Wednesday But I can always shovel my way to the woodpile which is dwindling faster than I expected Still have plenty to get me through the season I feel very secure and able to deal with any emergenciesinconveniences that might arise like power outage etc It will be interesting to see how the house handles the winds now that my windbreak to northwest has been reduced quite a bit The positive side to having had so many trees cut down surrounding the place is that I might not be as vulnerable to falling timber Both cats are in of course sleeping through it all I doubt that even Dancer will want to get out in this tonightnot that Id let him Looks like Clare may have gone to Mass so she wont have to travel in bad weather Keep hearing references to the Blizzard of I was in New Ipswich during that one but NH faired quite well compared to other places like Connecticut where people lost power for weeks I believe Cant recall what happened here but it must not have been too bad Im forwarding some info about SDECSB that bodes well for employees Im not able to take advantage of any of this right now but after a year next Oct I should qualify for participating in their retirement program Highlights is a good company to be associated with One other thing I keep forgetting to ask about is the money I received from you in How do I handle that As earnings that will be taxed Have had CNN on since I got home and have been listening to reports about Cheneys heart concerns and the shooting at high school in Santee CA where people were killed and wounded A ninth grader who I believe is in custody did the shooting Will this ever stop I feel more pangs of uneasiness listening to news of that kind while being by myself than I do facing a winter storm alone Let me know when late Valentine arrives You might want to keep it in your office I bought one for me too and have it at CSB Thats all Ill say as I dont want to give away the surprise Again it isnt anything big or seriousjust some fun Better throw a few more logs into the stove Lines may be tied up tonight so we may not be able to talk If not sleep well and have pleasant dreams Love Sandy ReturnPath DEcom

was written by Patricia Monaghan a professor at De Paul University in Chicago and author of The Dictionary of Goddesses and Heroines among many other books To buy an American flag you must present proof you have voted at least once in the last three elections yes local and state elections count To display an American flag in any form you must present proof of voter registration To wave an American flag in public you must be able to name at least one of the following A Your Senator B Your Representative C Your President George Bush does not count ambiguous To sell any product with an American flag on it you must answer the following question The Bill of Rights is part of A The Constitution B The Magna Carta C The Declaration of Independence Those heard singing patriotic songs in public may be asked to show their voter registration cards To be permitted to scream Nuke Afghanistan you must be able to correctly locate Afghanistan on a map or globe To be permitted to scream Arabs go home you must list and correctly locate ten Arab homelands Those who wish to express opinions about Arabs and ArabAmericans must pass the following test A Those who follow the religion of Islam are called Moslems Muslins Fanatics B The holy book of Islam is called The Koran The Koram The Bible C In Arabic God is called Ali Allah Jehovah Priority for purchase of American flags will be given to those whose ancestors lived on American soil the longest When all American Indians who wish to display the red white and blue are satisfied other applicants will be accepted A call for war on any radio talkshow will be construed as a public declaration of willingness to enlist in the US Army callers will have hours to complete the paperwork Perceiving the Situation By Michael Albert from ZNet which is providing free daily updates all this month zmagorg Beyond Bush and his ilk predictably trying to use calamity to propel their reactionary agendas on every front they can from repressive legislation about eavesdropping to military expansion and even to tax policy it is certainly also true and must be faced that many citizens are in a violent mood suggesting all kinds of anticivilian acts So many that it feels overwhelming But how many US citizens who are advocating bombings realize that the people of Afghanistan already live in a horrendously wartorn country made virtually rubble from its war with Russia How many understand that hunger and the danger of starvation for Afghanistan is so great that a misstep at this juncture for example cutting off all outside food aid even without bombs could cause not thousands but literally millions of innocent deaths by starvation Not many of our citizens is my guess When such information is conveyed how many will hold to the vengeful stance When it becomes evident that vengeance by assault on civilians is precisely terrorism that assault on civilians for political purposes is precisely terrorism how many will want to hold to warring indiscriminately to being a terrorist One wonders how many of those working at Ground Zero in NYC would wish military devastation on innocent civilians in another country Not many if any is my guess But what is even more promising is that even in a moment of great pain and mourning even at a time of national rallying even when all public pressures cry for war even before there has been opportunity to counter media madness and government manipulation with valid argument and evidence even now many and probably most people are already wondering at least somewhat about the wisdom of Bushs stance and are even contemplating such unspeakable conclusions as that the cure for terrorism is not more and even greater terrorism and that the cure for fanaticism is not to dispense with civil liberties I think there may be a tendency afoot among many activists totally understandable to see the great outpourings of nationalism and to be pessimistic beyond what evidence warrants Yes the events have been horrible in their immediate impact of course And yes the hypocritical willingness of Bush and others to try to parlay pain into more suffering in different forms and even into more terror has been stunning and terrifying But there are good signs too not solely in the humanity of the massive outpourings of sympathy but also in the opposition to race hatred against Arabs that has erupted as quickly and perhaps more pervasively than the reverse and in the almost instantaneous emergence of both reason and activism regarding war prospects Thus I want to share with you information from a communication from Portland Oregon The letter writer communicates that Today we had an antiwar demo in Portland Like so many of you have expressed I too have felt that we are heading into a very dark time for activism no less radical politics Now Portland has seen a fair amount of activism lately events large for this years May Day march which had a permit taken out by the City Council because organizers refused to get one and the city didnt want to arrest everyone and small radical activists and union brothers and sisters shutting down the Port of Portland and delaying the offloading of an Italian vessel in protest of the G police rioting a picket line which the longshoremen refused to cross setting off similar actions as that ship proceeded along the west coast I say all that for context because I reckon things are a bit better here for that sort of activism than in many other communities around the country Having said that this was the largest demonstration Ive been to in Portland since the Gulf War Organizers were able to do a pretty good count as we were walking along a narrow area and there were at least people there to speak against the incessant beating of the war drums Nobody could believe it Everyone strangers I talked to acquaintances I talked to had been feeling very isolated and had taken on a very bleak attitude about the future of the left We marched in the streets without a permit spanning or more blocks There were no police anywhere to be seen This caused some problems in that they do tend to be helpful with traffic control Ah well we did ok without em on that one too a few irate drivers notwithstanding Well isnt enough to stop the impending war but its a far bigger start than anyone expected All is not lost Lets not let our gloomy perspectives of the moment which are perfectly understandable as we watch the manufacture of consent occur before our very eyes at breakneck speed lets not let that gloom turn our very rational fears into a selffulfilling prophesy Afterward I went to a vigil organized by the Christian Coalition This occurred in the main public square in town semiprivately owned and operated There were fewer people at this one but not by much The creepy rhetoric of rightwing Christianity was toned down but not by much At least it was toned down though We were there mostly in case of needing to protect any victims of the racism seething beneath the surface I stood amidst the sea of American flags amidst the rousing renditions of the great patriotic hits holding a Jingoism Hurts America sign I got into some rather interesting conversations with people who wanted to know what jingoism meant I described it as a form of rhetoric using a chauvinistic patriotism to justify an arrogant and belligerent foreign policy Some nodded and walked away but many lingered to discuss My friends and I were only too happy to oblige With some sensitivity it is possible to clue people in on the activities of the CIA in the overthrow of democratic governments the institution of autocratic regimes such as the Taliban and the creation of Osama bin Laden himself I couldnt believe the conversations Who knows if we did anything Anyhow its not necessarily doom and gloom lets get back out there and be visible now I got the above letter without a return email address for its author But here is my replyYes you did something You did precisely what we all need to be doing You went out and worked for peace and justice and you did it without fear and without arrogance and without presuppositions And you showed in the process what the potential is of such work Is The Left Unilaterally Disarming by Rick Giombetti Just published in Counterpunch under a different title Pauls note A more accurate title for this piece would have been Are Liberals Unilaterally Disarming What good is a Bill of Rights when influential organizations are unwilling to stand up for their constitutional rights in a time of crisis and danger The AFLCIO International Rivers Network Rainforest Action Network the Sierra Club the Rukus Society and Friends of the Earth are among the many liberal organizations that have announced that they are canceling protests and even suspending entire campaigns because of the September terror attacks Its bad enough that the mass media is leading the drum beat for war and the public towards a deadly embrace with fascism in the wake of the tragic attacks Now much of the left is engaging in what amounts to unilateral disarmament at a time when the Bill of Rights needs as many defenders as possible There is much justified fear about a suspension of constitutional rights and marshal law But what government needs to ban demonstrations if there isnt anybody willing to hold them Perhaps the most disturbing example of this is an internal Sierra Club memo circulated among the organizations leadership and staff secured by the DC political newsletter Counter Punch The memo explains that in response to the attacks on America we are shifting our communications strategy for the immediate future We have taken all of our ads off the air halted our phone banks removed any material from the web that people could perceive as antiBush and we are taking other steps to prevent the Sierra Club from being perceived as controversial during the crisis For now we are going to stop aggressively pursuing our agenda and will cease bashing Bush Imagine if Martin Luther King had spouted similar tripe in his Beyond Vietnam speech In that great speech given a yeartotheday before he was assassinated on April King denounced the US war against Vietnam and called the US government the greatest purveyor of violence in the world How forgetful that speech would have been had King urged advocates for social justice to not say anything too controversial about the Vietnam War and not to say anything that could be perceived by people as being antiJohnson Kings sentiments werent popular among much of the general public but he wouldnt be remembered as the great activist he was if he didnt have the courage to express his convictions Among the groups calling off participation in the upcoming IMFWorld Bank demonstrations is Friends of the Earth FoE President Brent Blackwelder wrote in a message to the organizations board and membership that it is also time for us to not lose heart nor to set aside our steadfast commitment to protecting the planet in every way possible He then justifies FoEs pullout from the IMFWorld Bank demonstration by stating that it is out of respect for those who lost their lives and out of concern for the safety of protesters we have chosen to demonstrate our commitment to peace and justice by not demonstrating Now let me get this straight According to FoEs reasoning those demonstrators who do show up in DC on September will be engaging in violence instead of expressing their own commitments to peace and justice FoEs reasoning for pulling out of the IMFWorld Bank demonstrations is in harmony with the FBIs classification of Reclaim The Streets as a terrorist organization RTS is a movement that advocates holding unpermitted block parties in urban areas Yes with an army of DJs armed with an arsenal of CDs and LPs RTS will be terrorizing an urban area near you WHAT ABSOLUTE NONSENSE Is a lobotomy a requirement for becoming a leader of a liberal organization David Brower must be rolling over in his grave right now A more honest and reasonable explanation for pulling out of the IMFWorld Bank demonstrations would be to explicitly state fear of police violence Blackwelder never once mentions this possibility in his message leaving the impression that it is protesters not police who would be the cause of violence if they were to show up and demonstrate The only thing he needed to write was something like were afraid the police are going to shoot demonstrators That would be a fair enough reason for not wanting to hold a protest Instead he wrote a confusing sentence that reads like it is comparing holding a peaceful demonstration with blowing up a building And Im really tired of hearing were canceling our demonstration out of respect for those who lost their lives Yeah what a fine way to honor the September victims Lets unilaterally give up our constitutional rights and join the flag waivers at the Sierra Club in helping the war makers usher in fascism The great environmental warrior David Brower would certainly not be expressing the above mentioned nonsense and he most likely would be endorsing the International Action Centers IAC call for an antiwar rally at the White House on September instead of the planned antiIMFWorld Bank rally Holding an antiwar rally on S would be a bold and potentially hazardous action Such a demonstration could be met with both police and counterdemonstrator violence However with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell blaming the ACLU People for the American Way gays lesbians atheists pagans feminists and abortion doctors for the terror attacks and pogroms against Arabs andor Muslims underway now is not the time to back down from defending the Bill of Rights There is no better time to stand up for principles than when they are deeply unpopular If antiVietnam war protesters had postponed demonstrations until it was convenient and safe to hold them then that movement would have never gotten off the ground Also and most importantly by not pulling out of a planned and already permitted demonstration the IAC will force the government to try to cancel it This way an organization like the ACLU can make an issue out of the demonstration being canceled in court This cant happen though if individuals or organizations are insisting on not upholding their constitutional rights Even if a march doesnt happen organizing for one right now is far better than the unilateral disarmament the above mentioned liberal organizations are engaging in Lets not let the September terror attacks be remembered as an American Reichstag Fire Here in Seattle the Church Council of Greater Seattle is organizing to protect mosques from violent attacks An attempted arson against a Seattle mosque has already been reported Meanwhile Seattle peace activists are considering holding demonstrations and teachins in as little as a week They should follow through on these plans Staying at home and not demonstrating isnt going to prevent fascism Rick Giombetti Seattle Americas Terrorist Roots Geov Parrish WorkingForChangecom September Throughout the world on any given day a man woman or child is likely to be displaced tortured killed or disappeared at the hands of governments or armed political groups More often than not the United States shares the blame Amnesty International Everything I did I did for my country Pol Pot As people recoil in horror at what is undeniably well a horror and a tragedy and as the US undoubtedly starts to mount retaliatory attacks here are a few brief reminders of how we got here I listened incredulously Monday as NPRs Talk of the Nation sunk to what I can only wish was a new low with a spirited cheerful explicit hourlong defense of the wholesome goodness for the entire world of the American Empire and its current global military dominance Two cheerleaders for this arrangement deftly handled softball questions while nobody in the segments I could stomach listening to bothered to point out that for example this country was founded because our muchworshipped Founding Fathers didnt like being told what to do by bullies halfway around the world Times havent changed that much Yesterday Henry Kissinger was facing accusations thank you Christopher Hitchens of being a war criminal Hes not alone Heres a short list of additional recent American war criminals essentially the American leaders of the last decades William Clinton former President for days and nights of bombing the civilians of Yugoslavia carried out by US Gen Wesley Clark under NATO auspices continuation of sanctions and rocket attacks upon the people of Iraq and illegal bombings of Somalia Bosnia Sudan and Afghanistan Gen Colin Powell Secretary of State for his leading role in the attacks on Panama Iraq and covering up My Lai George Bush former President for the murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and thousands of Panamanian civilians along with kidnapping the countrys leader a former CIA protg Gen Norman Schwarzkopf former Commander in Chief US Central Command for his role in attacking Iraqi civilians Ronald Reagan former President for illegal attacks on El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala Grenada and Libya Elliot Abrams former Assistant Secretary of State and back in the new Bush Administration for overseeing much of the death and fascism in Central America Also Casper Weinberger Secretary of Defense Lt Col Oliver North and many others Henry Kissinger former Secretary of State Chile Vietnam East Timor Angola Iraq and Cambodia Gerald Ford former President for giving approval to Indonesia for the genocide of East Timor And on back through the war in Southeast Asia War criminal means just thatinflicting a level of carnage barbaric and unacceptable even in time of war It does not even begin to touch the many regimes today Israel comes to mind that the US has supported armed advised and even installed who have inflicted horrors on their own populations This is a day of complete horror in the history of the United States and the American public as well as its leaders will demand retribution Lets not forget however how we got to this day Michael Moore on the road heading to NYC excerpts from his daily log I continue to be amazed at the large number of people both on the radio and those we run into who are completely opposed to some halfcocked military response to what has happened No matter what the media tells you or shows you I am convinced there is a majority of Americans who though they want justice and want to be protected from further attacks do not want George W Bush to start sounding like Dr Strangelove and It seems like every sign and flashing marquee along the road has some sort of message regarding the massacre in New York GOD BLESS AMERICA UNLEADED GAL and REMEMBER WORLD TRADE CENTER PORK CHOP BREAKFAST But then a Southern Baptist preacher comes on the radio and says the following Perhaps America has some repenting to do We propped up the Shah of Iran when maybe we shouldnt have We have used the poor of the world to make our goods so we can make a profit when maybe we shouldnt These were stunning words to hear but it coincided with much of what we have been picking up along the road namely that many many Americans are not in support of going off halfcocked and bombing innocent people no matter how much we all want those responsible to be brought to justice I continue to be hopeful Michael Moore wwwmichaelmoorecom Hold the Vision by Starhawk The world has changed in the past week An act of violence and horror has cost the lives of thousands and shattered all of our plans and expectations for the future We who have been working for global justice now face an enormous challenge Since Seattle weve built and sustained a movement in spite of continually escalating police violence and attempts by the media to paint us as violent thugs Genoa did not intimidate us and momentum was growing for the demonstrations in Washington DC at the end of the month Public opinion was shifting and the whole edifice of corporate rule was losing legitimacy The terrorist attacks of last Tuesday could undermine all of our work at least in the short term They are the perfect excuse for the state to intensify its repression restrict civil liberties and for anyone who speaks out against blind retaliation to be demonized The mood of the country is potentially ugly People are scared Theyre angry Their sense of power and invulnerability has been badly shaken and in the US theyre not used to it Theyre grasping at anything which can restore their sense of power over their lives and in a violent society that means punishment retaliation war And many of us activists are also scared I know how easily I can sink into fear and despair right now Im scared of the repression that might come scared of being personally targeted scared of the loss of our liberties scared yes of further attacks But most of all Im scared for the movement which I believe is crucial to our survival as a species And yet I also believe that the current crisis can be a great opportunity if we can only see how to grasp it Extraordinary times create extraordinary openings and possibilities Our usual patterns and ways of thinking are shattered When structures fall something new can be built To do that we have to behave in extraordinary ways We need to acknowledge our fears but not act out of fear Fear leads to bad decisions and constricted vision just when we need to see most clearly Hold on hold on hold the vision thats being born our cluster chanted in Quebec City It may be that the most radical thing we can do right now is to act from our vision not our fear and to believe in the possibility of its realization Every force around us is pushing us to close downinsulate retreat Instead we need to advance but in a different way Were called to take a leap into the unknown As a movement weve often been accused of lacking a clear vision of the world we want I think we do have a vision that includes diversity and rejects uniform dogmatic formulations But within all its varied forms theres a clear common ground we want a world of liberty and justice for all It sounds downright patriotic but if you think about its ramifications they are revolutionary And we want a world in which no one has to fear violence which is the ultimate violation of freedom There are many voices right now trying to mobilize people around fear anger and blame As radicals tried to mobilize people out of guilt or shame This is the moment to reinvent our approach our strategies and our tactics to believe in the possibility of moving people to act from hope to act in the service of what they love What would this look like It would mean embodying the world we want to create in our own movement and in our actions Times of grief and anguish can strengthen our bonds Right now more than ever we in the movement need each other as never before and we need to treat each other well to cherish and care for and support each other and become the community we like to imagine Our solidarity must go deeper than weve ever known before Solidarity means listening to each other with respect and being willing to protect and support people with whom we may disagree on many levels or who might simply irritate us Solidarity means strengthening our practice of direct democracy our openness and communication with each other our willingness to bring everyone to the table and give everyone affected by a decision a voice in making it It means putting aside our usual internal politicking and maneuvering and treating each other with openness and trust This is not simple to do But in a moment when the ordinary patterns of life around us have been shattered shifting our own patterns of behavior may actually be easier Perspectives change and the issues that last week seemed so important now seem trivial What would this look like tactically say in DC two weeks from now First wed have to deliberately drop our assumptions whether they are that confrontation is always the strongest action or that nonviolence is always the most moral action or that direct action is always our strategy of choice or that a march and a rally with speakers are the ultimate form of politics and ask what makes most sense What is most visionary Id like to see whatever we do involve some kind of process of mutual discussion and education around our visions of alternatives And Id like to see us think of ways to take that outside of our own groups and into the community and to bring in voices from the community to teach us about their issues and concerns That could be a consulta a teachin or maybe a learnin where we go out into the community and ask people how issues of power and inequality affect their lives or what their visions are of the world they want In a time of fear and despair calling people to consider their visions could be a powerful form of action I also think its important symbolically and politically that we make some kind of strong visible presence in the streets that we dont voluntarily relinquish the one political space in which weve been able to have a significant impact But I also think its important that what we do in the street be appropriate to the moment A mourning procession a vigil or rite of healing might make sense right now a standard march with shouted slogans and printed signs would be offensive But its hard to predict what the mood or situation of the country will be two weeks from now We could be heading into a full fledged war and a large march might be a needed and powerful statement Direct action is a powerful tool but like a chainsaw its not the tool you want in every situation Direct action points a spotlight on an issue can directly interfere with an unjust group or situation and delegitimize an institution or policy Used at the wrong moment without a strong base of support it risks legitimizing the very institutions we seek to undermine Many police have just given their lives because they stayed in a dangerous situation helping other people get out A lot of us in this struggle talk about being willing to die They just did Whatever we feel about police as tools of the state now is not a good moment for a heavy police confrontation In fact although generally Im against negotiating with the police in this case Id certainly consider that it might be a wise and even a generous thing to do As individuals the police are of a class that doesnt gain from the policies we oppose Lets not write off the possibility that some of them could be brought to support us I want peace not war But calling for peace at this moment does not sufficiently address the fear anger and powerlessness people feel Id like to see us call for justice Justice for the victims of this weeks terrorist attacks Justice not blind vengeancemeaning that we need to know clearly and certainly who carried out the attacks before we retaliate Justice for the Arab Americans who live among us They deserve our support and protection Justice for the people of other countries who could soon become our victims Justice for the many many victims of ongoing terror around the world and recognition of the part we have played in supporting and forging that terror Economic and environmental justice These are my thoughts at the moment They could change as the situation changes But mostly I suggest that we all begin a creative thinking process that we consciously choose to set aside our fears and our depression I suggest that before we agree to do anything weve done before we consider at least three creative new alternatives I think we should show up in Washington if not in the numbers and way we expected then in some other dimension of strength and hold open the possibility that we can create not just a protest but moments of public beauty that can transform the world Finally I want to say a word about faith Faith and religion are being thrown around and served up to us in ways that are at the moment rather sickening Religion of any denomination can motivate the worst acts and be a rationale for hate And yet its hard to get through times like these without faith in something I dont generally like to inflict my spirituality on people who might not want it But I feel moved to tell you whats getting me through the night along with the love and support of my community Its the faith that there is a great creative power that works through the living world toward life diversity healing and regeneration That power works in us in our human love in our work for justice in our courage and our visions We dont need priests or ministers or even Witches to contact that power for us we each have our own direct line It exists within us infinite unlimited Ultimately it is stronger than fear stronger than violence stronger than hate I wish you all deep contact with whatever feeds your soul and nourishment from whoever and whatever you most love WHO IS OUSMANE BIN LADEN by Michel Chossudovsky Professor of Economics University of Ottawa Centre for Research on Globalisation CRG at httpglobalresearchca The url of this article is articlesCHOChtml Posted September A few hours after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon the Bush administration concluded without supporting evidence that Ousmane bin Laden and his alQaeda organisation were prime suspects CIA Director George Tenet stated that bin Laden has the capacity to plan multiple attacks with little or no warning Secretary of State Colin Powell called the attacks an act of war and President Bush confirmed in an evening televised address to the Nation that he would make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them Former CIA Director James Woolsey pointed his finger at state sponsorship implying the complicity of one or more foreign governments In the words of former National Security Adviser Lawrence Eagleburger I think we will show when we get attacked like this we are terrible in our strength and in our retribution Meanwhile parroting official statements the Western media mantra has approved the launching of punitive actions directed against civilian targets in the Middle East In the words of William Saffire writing in the New York Times When we reasonably determine our attackers bases and camps we must pulverize them minimizing but accepting the risk of collateral damage and act overtly or covertly to destabilize terrors national hosts The following text outlines the history of Ousmane Bin Laden and the links of the Islamic Jihad to the formulation of US foreign policy during the Cold War and its aftermath Prime suspect in the New York and Washington terrorists attacks branded by the FBI as an international terrorist for his role in the African US embassy bombings Saudi born Ousmane bin Laden was recruited during the SovietAfghan war ironically under the auspices of the CIA to fight Soviet invaders In the largest covert operation in the history of the CIA was launched in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in support of the proCommunist government of Babrak Kamal With the active encouragement of the CIA and Pakistans ISI Inter Services Intelligence who wanted to turn the Afghan jihad into a global war waged by all Muslim states against the Soviet Union some Muslim radicals from Islamic countries joined Afghanistans fight between and Tens of thousands more came to study in Pakistani madrasahs Eventually more than foreign Muslim radicals were directly influenced by the Afghan jihad The Islamic jihad was supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia with a significant part of the funding generated from the Golden Crescent drug trade In March President Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive which authorized steppedup covert military aid to the mujahideen and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal to defeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a Soviet withdrawal The new covert US assistance began with a dramatic increase in arms supplies a steady rise to tons annually by as well as a ceaseless stream of CIA and Pentagon specialists who traveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistans ISI on the main road near Rawalpindi Pakistan There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani intelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels The Central Intelligence Agency CIA using Pakistans military InterServices Intelligence ISI played a key role in training the Mujahideen In turn the CIA sponsored guerrilla training was integrated with the teachings of Islam Predominant themes were that Islam was a complete sociopolitical ideology that holy Islam was being violated by the atheistic Soviet troops and that the Islamic people of Afghanistan should reassert their independence by overthrowing the leftist Afghan regime propped up by Moscow PAKISTANS INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS Pakistans ISI was used as a gobetween The CIA covert support to the jihad operated indirectly through the Pakistani ISI ie the CIA did not channel its support directly to the Mujahideen In other words for these covert operations to be successful Washington was careful not to reveal the ultimate objective of the jihad which consisted in destroying the Soviet Union In the words of CIAs Milton Beardman We didnt train Arabs Yet according to Abdel Monam Saidali of the Alaram Center for Strategic Studies in Cairo bin Laden and the Afghan Arabs had been imparted with very sophisticated types of training that was allowed to them by the CIA CIAs Beardman confirmed in this regard that Ousmane bin Laden was not aware of the role he was playing on behalf of Washington In the words of bin Laden quoted by Beardman neither I nor my brothers saw evidence of American help Motivated by nationalism and religious fervor the Islamic warriors were unaware that they were fighting the Soviet Army on behalf of Uncle Sam While there were contacts at the upper levels of the intelligence hierarchy Islamic rebel leaders in theatre had no contacts with Washington or the CIA With CIA backing and the funneling of massive amounts of US military aid the Pakistani ISI had developed into a parallel structure wielding enormous power over all aspects of government The ISI had a staff composed of military and intelligence officers bureaucrats undercover agents and informers estimated at Meanwhile CIA operations had also reinforced the Pakistani military regime led by General Zia Ul Haq Relations between the CIA and the ISI Pakistans military intelligence had grown increasingly warm following General Zias ouster of Bhutto and the advent of the military regime During most of the Afghan war Pakistan was more aggressively antiSoviet than even the United States Soon after the Soviet military invaded Afghanistan in Zia ul Haq sent his ISI chief to destabilize the Soviet Central Asian states The CIA only agreed to this plan in October the CIA was more cautious than the Pakistanis Both Pakistan and the United States took the line of deception on Afghanistan with a public posture of negotiating a settlement while privately agreeing that military escalation was the best course THE GOLDEN CRESCENT DRUG TRIANGLE The history of the drug trade in Central Asia is intimately related to the CIAs covert operations Prior to the SovietAfghan war opium production in Afghanistan and Pakistan was directed to small regional markets There was no local production of heroin In this regard Alfred McCoys study confirms that within two years of the onslaught of the CIA operation in Afghanistan the PakistanAfghanistan borderlands became the worlds top heroin producer supplying percent of US demand In Pakistan the heroinaddict population went from near zero in to million by a much steeper rise than in any other nation CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade As the Mujahideen guerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan they ordered peasants to plant opium as a revolutionary tax Across the border in Pakistan Afghan leaders and local syndicates under the protection of Pakistan Intelligence operated hundreds of heroin laboratories During this decade of wideopen drugdealing the US Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to instigate major seizures or arrests US officials had refused to investigate charges of heroin dealing by its Afghan allies because US narcotics policy in Afghanistan has been subordinated to the war against Soviet influence there In the former CIA director of the Afghan operation Charles Cogan admitted the CIA had indeed sacrificed the drug war to fight the Cold War Our main mission was to do as much damage as possible to the Soviets We didnt really have the resources or the time to devote to an investigation of the drug trade I dont think that we need to apologize for this Every situation has its fallout There was fallout in terms of drugs yes But the main objective was accomplished The Soviets left Afghanistan IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR In the wake of the Cold War the Central Asian region is not only strategic for its extensive oil reserves it also produces three quarters of the Worlds opium representing multibillion dollar revenues to business syndicates financial institutions intelligence agencies and organized crime The annual proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade between and billion dollars represents approximately one third of the Worldwide annual turnover of narcotics estimated by the United Nations to be of the order of billion With the disintegration of the Soviet Union a new surge in opium production has unfolded According to UN estimates the production of opium in Afghanistan in coinciding with the build up of armed insurgencies in the former Soviet republics reached a record high of metric tons Powerful business syndicates in the former Soviet Union allied with organized crime are competing for the strategic control over the heroin routes The ISIs extensive intelligence militarynetwork was not dismantled in the wake of the Cold War The CIA continued to support the Islamic jihad out of Pakistan New undercover initiatives were set in motion in Central Asia the Caucasus and the Balkans Pakistans military and intelligence apparatus essentially served as a catalyst for the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of six new Muslim republics in Central Asia Meanwhile Islamic missionaries of the Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia had established themselves in the Muslim republics as well as within the Russian federation encroaching upon the institutions of the secular State Despite its antiAmerican ideology Islamic fundamentalism was largely serving Washingtons strategic interests in the former Soviet Union Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops in the civil war in Afghanistan continued unabated The Taliban were being supported by the Pakistani Deobandis and their political party the JamiatulUlemaeIslam JUI In JUI entered the government coalition of Prime Minister Benazzir Bhutto Ties between JUI the Army and ISI were established In with the downfall of the HezbIIslami Hektmatyar government in Kabul the Taliban not only instated a hardline Islamic government they also handed control of training camps in Afghanistan over to JUI factions And the JUI with the support of the Saudi Wahhabi movements played a key role in recruiting volunteers to fight in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union Jane Defense Weekly confirms in this regard that half of Taliban manpower and equipment originated in Pakistan under the ISI In fact it would appear that following the Soviet withdrawal both sides in the Afghan civil war continued to receive covert support through Pakistans ISI In other words backed by Pakistans military intelligence ISI which in turn was controlled by the CIA the Taliban Islamic State was largely serving American geopolitical interests The Golden Crescent drug trade was also being used to finance and equip the Bosnian Muslim Army starting in the early s and the Kosovo Liberation Army KLA In last few months there is evidence that Mujahideen mercenaries are fighting in the ranks of KLANLA terrorists in their assaults into Macedonia No doubt this explains why Washington has closed its eyes on the reign of terror imposed by the Taliban including the blatant derogation of womens rights the closing down of schools for girls the dismissal of women employees from government offices and the enforcement of the Sharia laws of punishment THE WAR IN CHECHNYA With regard to Chechnya the main rebel leaders Shamil Basayev and Al Khattab were trained and indoctrinated in CIA sponsored camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan According to Yossef Bodansky director of the US Congresss Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare the war in Chechnya had been planned during a secret summit of HizbAllah International held in in Mogadishu Somalia The summit was attended by Osama bin Laden and highranking Iranian and Pakistani intelligence officers In this regard the involvement of Pakistans ISI in Chechnya goes far beyond supplying the Chechens with weapons and expertise the ISI and its radical Islamic proxies are actually calling the shots in this war Russias main pipeline route transits through Chechnya and Dagestan Despite Washingtons perfunctory condemnation of Islamic terrorism the indirect beneficiaries of the Chechen war are the AngloAmerican oil conglomerates which are vying for control over oil resources and pipeline corridors out of the Caspian Sea basin The two main Chechen rebel armies respectively led by Commander Shamil Basayev and Emir Khattab estimated at strong were supported by Pakistans ISI which also played a key role in organizing and training the Chechen rebel army In the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence arranged for Basayev and his trusted lieutenants to undergo intensive Islamic indoctrination and training in guerrilla warfare in the Khost province of Afghanistan at Amir Muawia camp set up in the early s by the CIA and ISI and run by famous Afghani warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar In July upon graduating from Amir Muawia Basayev was transferred to MarkaziDawar camp in Pakistan to undergo training in advanced guerrilla tactics In Pakistan Basayev met the highest ranking Pakistani military and intelligence officers Minister of Defense General Aftab Shahban Mirani Minister of Interior General Naserullah Babar and the head of the ISI branch in charge of supporting Islamic causes General Javed Ashraf all now retired Highlevel connections soon proved very useful to Basayev Following his training and indoctrination stint Basayev was assigned to lead the assault against Russian federal troops in the first Chechen war in His organization had also developed extensive links to criminal syndicates in Moscow as well as ties to Albanian organized crime and the Kosovo Liberation Army KLA In according to Russias Federal Security Service FSB Chechen warlords started buying up real estate in Kosovo through several real estate firms registered as a cover in Yugoslavia Basayevs organisation has also been involved in a number of rackets including narcotics illegal tapping and sabotage of Russias oil pipelines kidnapping prostitution trade in counterfeit dollars and the smuggling of nuclear materials See Mafia linked to Albanias collapsed pyramids Alongside the extensive laundering of drug money the proceeds of various illicit activities have been funneled towards the recruitment of mercenaries and the purchase of weapons During his training in Afghanistan Shamil Basayev linked up with Saudi born veteran Mujahideen Commander Al Khattab who had fought as a volunteer in Afghanistan Barely a few months after Basayevs return to Grozny Khattab was invited early to set up an army base in Chechnya for the training of Mujahideen fighters According to the BBC Khattabs posting to Chechnya had been arranged through the SaudiArabian based International Islamic Relief Organisation a militant religious organisation funded by mosques and rich individuals which channeled funds into Chechnya CONCLUDING REMARKS Since the Cold War era Washington has consciously supported Ousmane bin Laden while at same time placing him on the FBIs most wanted list as the Worlds foremost terrorist While the Mujahideen are busy fighting Americas war in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union the FBI operating as a US based Police Force is waging a domestic war against terrorism operating in some respects independently of the CIA which has since the SovietAfghan war supported international terrorism through its covert operations In a cruel irony while the Islamic jihad featured by the Bush Adminstration as a threat to America is blamed for the terrorist assaults on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon these same Islamic organisations constitute a key instrument of US militaryintelligence operations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington the truth must prevail to prevent the Bush Adminstration together with its NATO partners from embarking upon a military adventure which threatens the

and radio shows some demanding a swift and brutal US response Anger fueled by images of Palestinians celebrating the attacks in the street prompted one local caller to say it was time to kill all the towel heads But scattered among the griefstricken and angry voices were a small number of Americans asking whether the United States has done anything to provoke such violence Its a question many people didnt appreciate Im appalled at the lack of patriotism said one caller who spoke out on KGNU radio Still its a question worth trying to answer Why is the United States despised John Wayne politics Local US policy experts and activists grappled with grief and shock Tuesday along with the rest of the country While they took pains to explain that they in no way excuse or condone Tuesdays violence some were willing to offer their insights into the reasons so many people hate America Understanding the motives behind terrorist attacks against the United States is hampered by the assumptions many Americans hold said Ira Chernus a professor of religious studies at CU One of those assumptions is that US intentions the world over are good even when the government or military makes mistakes The belief that were only trying to help makes it hard for us to understand why anyone would do something like this to us Chernus said Related to that assumption is the belief that the United States is both innocent and invulnerable which prevents Americans from listening to the message behind such events The important thing is to be able to listen insofar as we can to the people who carried out this thing Chernus said We start out with the assumption that theres no point in listening to what they have to say The general assumption is that if you listen to what they say that endorses the attack Chernus points out that the message of terrorists on trial for other acts of violence around the world has been left out of court coverage People never get a clear picture of whats bothering these people and why they were driven to such extremes While some critics claim that US policy is motivated by greed or aggression Chernus believes foreign policy since World War II has been focused on defending the country against perceived threats like communism and the Soviet Union Those efforts to protect and defend often extend far beyond US borders however forcing the United States into conflict with other peoples We believe the only way to defend the United States is to organize the world We step on other peoples toes every day in ways we cant understand Chernus said Its a stupid way to defend yourself because in the end you experience more risk According to David Barsamian host of the nationally broadcast program Alternative Radio risk to American lives comes as a result of rage generated by US foreign policy and economic and cultural hegemony Its directly related to its foreign policy and its perception as the primary agent and enforcer of the status quo of the global capitalist system said Barsamian Barsamian sat in his Boulder home Tuesday watching coverage of the very shocking attacks on television Whats extraordinary about these attacks is the level of sophistication Barsamian said Where is the CIA Where is the FBI Where are the tens of billions of dollars being spent Starbucks closes all stores internationally This is huge Look at the level of panic here Speculation since the attacks has centered on various Islamic fundamentalist groups particularly Saudi Arabian exile Osama Bin Laden and his followers While pointing out that we dont know who is responsible for the attacks Barsamian stressed there is a great deal of rage toward the United States in the Middle East US foreign policy is seen by many Middle Eastern people as being overwhelmingly onesided in favor of Israel he said Theres tremendous anger toward the United States and theres a tremendous irony in this If it is traced to Bin Laden hes a product of US foreign policy In an effort to drive the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan the US swallowed its repugnance toward Bin Laden and men like him who were trained and funded by the CIA in a bit of Cold War strategy that has had devastating consequences as the students turn their weapons against their teachers This is an example of blowback Barsamian said adding if it can be traced to this particular group which is not farfetched Joel Edelstein professor of political science at CUDenver and producer of programs at KGNU radio acknowledged that Israel has legitimate concerns about its safety Still the struggle in the Middle East has been over land with the United States supporting a policy that is devastating to Palestinians he said You have this ongoing degradation of Palestinians Edelstein said They really were forced out of their houses Their houses really were bulldozed The United States spends billion annually on aid to Israel which goes to support these actions and to defend Israels continued settlement on the West Bank Americans would not sit quiet if they were treated like the Palestinians are treated by the Israelis Edelstein said Barsamian said Israels policies build desperation in Palestinian people If you lose your land if you cannot feed your family if youve been culturally humiliated if youve been denigrated on all sides this creates a reaction and that reaction can take extreme forms he said Terrorism Barsamian said is the poor mans B But its not just US policy in the Middle East that makes the United States a target experts agree Nor is dissatisfaction with the United States limited to Muslims US indifference toward World Court rulings its refusal to fulfill its financial obligations to the United Nations and its global military presence also inspire antipathy in people around the world including Americas allies To Americans it seems perfectly normal that we have military bases in scores of countries but imagine if Thailand had bases in Canada Barsamian said conjuring up images of Thai fighters enforcing nofly zones over parts of the United States The US military presence is offensive to people around the world he said This is particularly true in the Middle East which has become a sort of floating military base with US warships continually stationed in waters surrounding the Persian Gulf This is arrogance This is imperial behavior Barsamian said The American imperial swagger that accompanies the US military only makes matters worse Barsamian said This swagger reveals itself in the US tendency to act unilaterally rejecting international opinion and even UN authority on issues like sanctions against Cuba the Kyoto Accord and nuclear weapons treaties International treaties are not us he said Bush has never met an international treaty he liked This is John Wayne politics Resentment toward the United States extends to Europe as well Any top dog faces resentment but some of it is rooted in quite strong political feeling Barsamian said Europeans are mystified and outraged by American use of capital punishment and the opposition of some Americans toward abortion And while European nations have tried to voice their opinions on US decisions and actions abroad the US government has not welcomed the feedback ignoring resolutions made by the European Parliament Were a rogue nation said Edelstein The European nations are looking at us in terms of putting missiles in space refusing to sign Kyoto Europe thinks were crazy Allies that used to vote with us or abstain from voting on controversial issues of importance to the United States are now voting against us as our isolation grows Edelstein said While Americans tend to view the United States as a force for freedom justice and democracy in the world many other peoples see the United States as an oppressor he said We are the sole hegemon Were returning to the concept of Manifest Destiny A world in poverty Not only does the United States export foreign policy It also exports its culture Barsamian said Theres not sensitivity to local culture and local traditions particularly in the Islamic world where tradition is stronger than it is in Europe This culture takes the form of Hollywood movies Starbucks and Burger Kings on street corners in places like Riyadh Saudi Arabia where American culture is considered suspect at best We tend to view the United States as the universal culture to which all others aspire said Edelstein This is based in part on misconceptions Americans have of their own country he said We think we have the highest wages which is not true Edelstein said We think we are the freest country which is debatable We tend to think we have the best democracy which is absurd Such blind faith in our own culture creates the mistaken belief that it is welcome everywhere In the United States culture is intimately tied to economy and the US government promotes the latter with a vengeance Barsamian said US diplomatic policy could be summed up this way Were going to do what we want Barsamian recalls a story Vandana Shiva shared with him during an interview Shiva a humanrights activist from India quoted a US trade representative speaking with Indian officials as saying If you dont open up your markets were going to break them open with a crowbar This is how the Mafia don speaks Barsamian said I often say if you want to understand US policy watch The Godfather Despite the effort put into the economy global capitalism has not delivered to many people around the globe Barsamian said It has not delivered the kind of benefits that are meaningful to segments of the population Having a Burger King around the corner is not meaningful Edelstein agrees The US government represents the wealthy in our own country he said And our friends are the wealthy in other countries You can see it in the development model we support through the IMF International Monetary Fund and World Bank This model ensures that a small percentage of people in developing countries move up financially but leaves the vast majority behind he said Intense protests against the IMF the World Bank and the World Trade Organization over the past two years indicate that some Americans are concerned about the connection between poverty and global development Edelstein said Carolyn Bninski a local activist who was arrested in April during the IMF protests in Washington DC said the current model of development accounts for about six million deaths worldwide each year We use economic power to impose policies on countries that benefit wealthy corporations in the United States but harm local people Bninski said A lot of people die slow deaths perhaps as a result of those policies I am in no way downplaying the horror of the terrorist attacks I think its a horrible tragedy But I think we need to start seeing our relationship to every life and everybody on this planet Scott Silber a local community organizer who has also participated in protests against the IMF World Bank and World Trade Organization said people from all segments of US society have become concerned about these economic policies People have been able to link the symptoms theyre fighting to global corporate power Silber said Those symptoms include violations of human rights workers rights the rights of women and indigenous people as well as the destruction of the environment and the blind pursuit of capital he said People are suffering Silber said The vast majority of the world is in poverty and the United States is on the benefiting end of that A call for empathy Bninski said she and other members of the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center fear the United States will retaliate blindly in a fury over Tuesdays attack resulting in the deaths of more innocent people The United States needs to go through legitimate international channels and to try people in a court of law thats legitimate Bninski said Its really important to reserve judgment and not to retaliate against people or groups of people Shes not the only one whos concerned Muslim students many of whom are American citizens by birth braced for an onslaught of hate mail threats and confrontations Muslim organizations across the country reported death threats and hate mail many pulling their Web sites to stem the tide of violent words But at CU where police have stepped up security and are prepared to protect Islamic students incidents have been minor Were all just holding each other said Amina Nawaz an American citizen and president of CUs Muslim Student Association Nawaz said some Muslims experienced heightened tensions in classes Tuesday One woman wearing the traditional hijab covering walked into her classroom where students were talking only to have the room fall silent when people saw her She could just feel everyones hatred boring into her Nawaz said But Nawaz said members of her organization are griefstricken over the attacks Were a part of the American community and we feel it just as strongly as anybody else she said Those who engineered the attacks dont reflect the values of Islam Nawaz said Shameless acts are not part of our religion she said Bninski said its time for Americans to learn to empathize with people who are suffering around the world While they connect to the suffering of other Americans they seem blind to the suffering of nonAmericans I think we have to think about every human life as being of equal value not just Americans Bninski said We need to start thinking of global citizens and think of the impact of US decisions on other people On Bninskis mind are the deaths of an estimated six million Iraqi children since due to USimposed sanctions and the destruction in Yugoslavia brought on by days of bombing I think of the images of Burmese workers on Americanowned pipelines with chains around their ankles said Silber I think of the workers I see every day all around me who are working hour days to survive and feed their families I think of the little children who are born into wartorn areas of the world where it seems like their lives are hopeless If only war werent profitable these kids wouldnt have to grow up in fear and suffering But most Americans dont make an effort to learn about the ways in which their nation contributes to tragedies in the world around them Chernus said Its willed ignorance he said Theres a cultural divide in the United States Theres a segment of our population that is able to perhaps imperfectly empathize with suffering in the world And there are those Americans who simply cant seem to relate Chernus fears Tuesdays horror will be written off as the work of unprovoked crazies and America will lose a chance to benefit from what could be a wakeup call If things were going right we would ask ourselves what role we may have played in the chain of events that led to this disaster If we were doing the right thing we would think of ourselves as part of a network of relationships Chernus said Its not a question of our fault or their fault but of how that network of relationships has gotten us to where we are today Barsamian said that discussions of US foreign policy will be kept out of the response to the attacks No ones going to go to the root causes not with corporate media acting as stenographers to power Barsamian said The media will say These are just genetically crazy people They were having bad hair days The media will focus selectively on Islamic fundamentalists leaving out mention of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait two very strict Muslim nations with which the United States has close political ties he predicted A constructive response Barsamian said would look more like this Start obeying international law Show respect for sensitivity for other cultures Stop bullying the world Stop acting like a Mafia don Work with difference Accept criticism Radically relook at our behavior in the Middle East Edelstein would like to see the United States respond by turning its effort inward For the American government to respond in a way that I would consider constructive would include the establishment of democracy in the United States And if the United States continues on its current path US foreign policy has not given people hope If you rob people of their dignity and selfrespect they have nothing Barsamian said Thats how you can become a suicide bomber Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just Thomas Jefferson Notes from Virginia US Foreign Interventions

from yesterday to today and i just heard now personally of all the responses ive seen come out of the left this is one of the calmest most rational wellthought out ones An optimistic activist account Transforming the unity of nationalism into a call for peace english by Stanley Call Mon Sep frontphparticleidgroupwebcast Friday night Whittier California I join one of the many candlelight flagwaving rallies and use a sign and dialogue to make the subtle shift to an antiwar demostration Coopting the Nationalist Fervor As I write this occasional honking horns and whoops can still be heard from the street below where women and children mostly Latinos are holding a rowdy candlelight vigil some with American flags The street was filled with carloads of young jubilant and rowdy people honking yelling and waving the flag I made a sign War will not bring Peace Dont Honk THINK Stop ALL terrorism including by the American Government and joined them At first I felt a little like I was competing with them I was upset by what I perceived as their insensitive nationalism and celebration when the United States has declared the first war of the st Century But I said hello showed them my sign answered their questions and stood quietly next to them on the corner holding up my sign and looking down solemnly Around the same time I got there two young boys arrived holding an American flag with a peace sign in place of stars Wouldve been better without the stripes too but hey I didnt join in the yelling Soon most of the people in passing cars were putting two fingers up for peace and some people quietly waved Many of the other people on the corner also started showing the peace sign It had become a nonviolent antiwar demonstration I learned through experience what I already knew intellectually that angry energy can be channeled for constructive uses and that people are most easily persuaded to do what is right when they feel theyve come to that decision on their own Imagine how different the scene would have been if I had started an angry counterdemonstration across the street I would have looked angry and crazy and would have been outnumbered Instead I got the support of a few in the group through a short discussion and was able to create the perception for passersby that EVERYBODY on that corner was demonstrating for peace This technique should be used more often It is similar to what agent provocateurs do to incite violence in a nonviolent crowd but with the opposite effect wwwgeocitiescomactionseed Call for a National March in Washington DC Saturday September Rally am at the White House National March Against War Racism Lets really help the September victims War racism are not the answer Dear Friends Our most heartfelt sympathies and condolences are with all those whose loved ones were lost or injured on September At this moment we would all like to take time to reflect to grieve to extend sympathy and condolences to all But we believe that we must do more We must act Unless we stop President Bush from carrying out a new wider war in the Middle East and beyond the number of innocent victims will grow from the thousands to the tens of thousands and possibly more A new wider US war in the Middle East can only lead to an escalating cycle of violence War is not the answer After the horrific killings of thousands of innocent civilians on Sept the Bush administration is moving in a very ominous direction In a chilling statement Bush administration spokespersons have called for ending states an unprecedented threat At the same time Arab American and Muslim people in the United States as well as other communities of color are facing racist attacks and harassment in their communities on their jobs and at mosques AntiArab and antiMuslim racism is a poison that should be repudiated The government is attempting to curb civil liberties and to create a climate in which it is impossible for progressive people to speak their mind The Bush administration is attempting to take advantage of this crisis to militarize US society with a vast expansion of police powers that is intended to severely restrict basic democratic rights On September we had planned to demonstrate against the Bush administrations reactionary foreign and domestic policy and the IMF and World Bank In light of the current crisis with its tragic consequences for so many thousands of people we have refocused the call for our demonstration to address the immediate danger posed by increased racism and the grave threat of a new war Now is the time for all people of conscience all people who oppose racism and war to come together If you believe in civil liberties and oppose racism and war join us on September in front of the White House We

September in the Guardian of London viewshtm Yesterdays attack brings home the fact that we cannot hide behind our peace and prosperity The evidence has been growing but our leaders did not want to see it The horrors of wars and deaths far away in the global south do not register But missile shields cannot protect us Powerful states cannot fully escape bricolage terrorism nail bombs elementary nuclear devices and homemade biological weapons The growth of debt and unemployment and the decline of traditional economic sectors has fed an illegal trade in people directed at the rich countries The diseases and pests of the global south are now in the global north as well TB is back in the US and the UK the encephalitisproducing Nile mosquito has arrived for the first time in the north As governments become poorer they depend more on the remittances of immigrants in the north and have little interest in managing emigration and illegal trafficking The pressures to be competitive make governments in poor countries cut their health education and social budgets further delaying development and stimulating emigration The rising debt poverty and disease in the south are beginning to reach deep into rich countries in the north We can no longer turn our backs on this misery If we dislike humanitarian reasons for addressing these issues we should at least be motivated by selfinterest We must now accept that markets cannot take care of everything Governments will have to govern more But we cannot return to the old system of countries surrounding themselves with protective walls It will take genuine multilateralism and internationalism radical innovations and new forms of collaboration with civil society and supranational institutions The violence of hunger and poverty the destruction of once fertile lands the oppression of weaker states by highly militarized ones persecution all these feed a complex slow but relentless movement towards the north The north creates much of the damage and the north has the resources to redress some of it Part of the challenge is actually to recognize the interconnectedness of forms of violence that we do not view as being connected or even as forms of violence We are suffering from a translation problem The language of poverty and misery is unclear and uncomfortable The language of yesterdays attacks is clear There are two problems in particular that must be addressed the debt trap and immigration The debt trap is far more significant than many in the north understand The focus is always on the amounts of the debts which are a small fraction of the overall global capital market now estimated at about trillion dollars But the debt trap will eventually ensnare the rich countries through the increase in illegal trafficking in people in drugs in arms through the reemergence of diseases we had thought were under control and through the further devastation of our fragile ecosystem The debt trap is now entangling more countries and it has reached middle income countries There are now about countries that are hyperindebted and unable to redress the situation It is no longer a matter of loan repayment but a fundamental new structural condition What is often overlooked or even unknown is that many of those debts are far more extreme than those that were considered as unmanageable levels of debt in the Latin American crisis of the s Debt to GNP ratios are especially high in Africa where they stood at compared with in Latin America and in Asia The IMF asks HIPCs to pay of their export earnings toward debt service In contrast in the Allies canceled of Germanys war debt and only insisted on of export earnings debt service These are the terms asked from Central Europe after Communism What can be done to pull these countries out of the trap Poor countries need to import goods and the West will only accept payment in dollars or other high value currencies This produces a trap that reproduces itself endlessly One of the few solutions to neutralize the trap is to allow countries to pay in their own currencies which would enable them to import needed goods for development and importantly eventually strengthen their currencies Few poor countries can avoid trade deficits of low and moderate income countries only had trade surpluses in the year These countries would like to export more as is shown by the recent setting up of a new African Trade Insurance Agency supporting exports to from and within Africa Such specialized and focused efforts are promising Most countries in the south are heavily dependent on imports of oil food and manufactured goods They need loans and once they have debts interest payments and other debt servicing costs escalate rapidly and their currencies are likely to devalue further Borrowing in the leading foreign currencies is a trap The government debts of poor countries and increasingly of middleincome countries as well need to be taken out of the global capital markets and placed in the domain of the interstate system J M Keynes proposed this in the s when the IMF was created And the IMF went in this direction with its plan to provide early financing before a crisis rather than bailing out rich countries investors The second great problem in immigration and illegal trafficking in people The growth of debt and its attendant economic griefs have created whole new migrations As the rich economies become richer they become more desirable places to be and have to raise their walls to keep immigrants and refugees out So they actually encourage the illegal trade in people We may think that the debt and growing poverty in the south have nothing to do with the violence in New York and Washington But they do The attacks are a language of last resort the oppressed and persecuted have used many languages to reach us so far but we seem unable to translate the meaning So a few have taken the personal responsibility to speak in a language that needs no translation An updated version of Saskia Sassens book The Global City is published by Princeton University Press Guardian Newspapers Limited The Sukkah the World Trade Center by Rabbi Arthur Waskow In when the nuclear arms race was in speedup mode The Shalom Center built a sukkah between the White House and the Soviet Embassy in Washington We focused on the line from the evening prayers Ufros alenu sukkat shlomekha Spread over all of us Your sukkah of shalom And we asked Why a sukkah Why does the prayer plead to God for a sukkah of shalom rather than Gods tent or house or palace of peace Because the sukkah is just a hut the most vulnerable of houses Vulnerable in time where it lasts for only a week each year Vulnerable in space where its roof must be not only leafy but leaky letting in the starlight and gusts of wind and rain For much of our lives we try to achieve peace and safety by building with steel and concrete and toughness Pyramids air raid shelters Pentagons World Trade Centers Hardening what might be targets and like Pharaoh hardening our hearts against what is foreign to us But the sukkah comes to remind us We are in truth all vulnerable If a hard rain gonna fall it will fall on all of us Americans have felt invulnerable The oceans our wealth our military power have made up what seemed an invulnerable shield We may have begun feeling uncomfortable in the nuclear age but no harm came to us Yet yesterday the ancient truth came home We all live in a sukkah Not only the targets of attack but also the instruments of attack were among our proudest possessions the sleek transcontinental airliners They availed us nothing Worse than nothing Even the greatest oceans do not shield us even the mightiest buildings do not shield us even the wealthiest balance sheets and the most powerful weapons do not shield us There are only wispy walls and leaky roofs between us The planet is in fact one interwoven web of life I MUST love my neighbor as I do myself because my neighbor and myself are interwoven If I hate my neighbor the hatred will recoil upon me What is the lesson when we learn that we all of us live in a sukkah How do we make such a vulnerable house into a place of shalom of peace and security and harmony and wholeness The lesson is that only a world where we all recognize our vulnerability can become a world where all communities feel responsible to all other communities And only such a world can prevent such acts of rage and murder If I treat my neighbors pain and grief as foreign I will end up suffering when my neighbors pain and grief curdle into rage But if I realize that in simple fact the walls between us are full of holes I can reach through them in compassion and connection Suspicion about the perpetrators of this act of infamy has fallen upon some groups that espouse a tortured version of Islam Whether or not this turns out to be so America must open its heart and mind to the pain and grief of those in the Arab and Muslim worlds who feel excluded denied unheard disempowered defeated This does not mean ignoring or forgiving whoever wrought such bloodiness Their violence must be halted their rage must be calmed and the pain behind them must be heard and addressed Instead of entering upon a war of civilizations we must pursue a planetary peace Shalom Arthur Rabbi Arthur Waskow Director The Shalom Center wwwshalomctrorg wwwFreeOurTimeorg A TRAGEDY FOR ALL HUMANITY A Statement by the Communist Party USA The terrorist attacks that killed and wounded thousands of innocent people Sept are crimes that call for universal worldwide condemnation At this writing the toll of dead and wounded is not known but it is certain to number in the thousands the deadliest terrorist attack ever The Communist Party USA expresses outrage and profound sorrow at this horrendous assault We unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms We extend heartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims including the thousands of office workers at both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and those who died in the crashes of the four planes We mourn the rescue workers hundreds of whom died in the line of duty in the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings Amid the carnage and the horror they displayed uncommon courage and self sacrifice as they struggled to save the wounded and dying The people have responded generously from ironworkers in their hardhats who raced to the scene to help search through the piles of rubble to the doctors and other medical workers who worked through the day and night to the thousands across the country who lined up to donate blood We urge that everyone who can participate in such efforts This tragedy has traumatized the nation The people understandably are in a state of shock and anger and are coming together to mourn just as we united in sorrow after the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City We must guard against a rush for military reprisals even before the perpetrators are known and apprehended There are calls for more military spending more intrusive surveillance both at home and abroad and curtailment of democratic rights Innocent Arab people both at home and abroad and immigrants across the US face a danger of racist and xenophobic attacks We call on the Bush Administration and all state and local authorities to take measures to guarantee everyones safety The danger is that the cycle of violence will spiral out of control with more death and destruction This moment calls for calm not hysteria initiatives for peace not war democracy not repression This crisis must be answered by a united world community of all nations and peoples The goal must be multilateral political solutions that eliminate the causes of violence and promote a just and equitable world the best and only true memorial to those who have died Other excellent sources for noncorporate independent news

not against America or American Im just against injustice enjoy Josianne From Herod Chris Date Mon Sep Subject FW Statement from Ghana Injustice Anywhere Injustice anywhere Knowing the risk of fighting against the currents of seemingly popular sentiment this is a suggestion that while we pray for the innocent victims of the events of last Tuesday let us also think very seriously about where we are in history and what we should be doing with our lives Here in Ghana across Africa and around the world every day mothers and fathers sisters and brothers and daughters and sons are dying as a direct result of American created directed and imposed policies and actions Daily American imperialism kills maims devastates and terrorizes the lives of normal innocent average people We are killed by policies which require that we pay a manufactured debt to a Wall Street banker before we pay to provide immunizations for our children We are killed by policies that require us to sell our businesses and resources to investors resulting in layoffs slave wages and our year old children selling water and oranges on the street for pennies We are killed by the dumping of Americanmade weapons into the hands of Americantrained soldiers gone crazy in the support of Americancontrolled oil in Nigeria sugar cane in Haiti diamonds in Sierra Leone and rubber in Liberia In the very same way on September many normal average innocent people lost their lives as a direct result of American imperialism Although it can be shocking it should not surprise us As Malcolm X said on another occasion Chickens come home to roost Perhaps more and more of us will continue to see that the masses of people normal average everyday folk all over the world are linked in our humanity We are linked in our reaction to the tragedy of innocent lives lost As a result of Tuesdays events many of us may also begin to see ourselves becoming increasingly linked in our susceptibility and vulnerability I also hope that we may also begin to see that wherever we may live in the world whatever language we speak whatever God we worship our lives are shaped in the extreme by the inhumane policies of a system which tremendously benefits just a few while leaving most of us clinging desperately to the vestiges of our humanity This same despicable system now attempts to continue its massive oppression of humanity by encouraging fostering and maintaining our ignorance keeping humanity divided and then distracted from the real cause of our suffering After highlighting the justifiable and understandable shock of average folk who have lost their innocence and their innocents we will also be shown images of people who celebrate the events that occurred in the US on September As usual they will simply show crowds rejoicing and the burning of American flags There will be no attempt to show or explain why so many in the world feel a justifiable and understandable hatred of America and its policies Many of us have lost our innocence long ago Many of us lost our land and control of our lives long ago We are fighting against America to get it back even within America Many of us have lost and continue to lose our mothers and fathers sisters and brothers and daughters and sons every day Whether we loose our neighbors or loved ones to malaria a crackoverdose AIDS dysentery zionist missiles or NATO bombers we understand the role that America and American policies play in these tragedies We have to understand why some people now celebrate when there is at least a sense that some consequence has fallen on America that the Goliath of the world does not always have its way This is not the first war of the st Century but rather a continuation of a war that started long ago Whether we know it or not whether we accept it or not we are in the midst of an ongoing war against injustice and oppression Despite imperialist attempts to portray everyone they kill as a crazed or fanatical demon most people in America do not celebrate the fact that Palestinians are losing their loved ones on a daily basis at the hands of Israelis with Americanmade weapons and an American financed military Most do not even know much less celebrate the fact that millions have been killed in the Congo and Central Africa as a direct result of first Europes and now Americas need to have unfettered access to its invaluable minerals and labor In the same way those who are rejoicing around the world today are not celebrating the death of innocent people in America Some are celebrating the possibility that maybe our own daily suffering and loss of life will soon end because of the recent events in America However this will not likely happen unless we are able to see through the cloud of dust imperialist media will use to hide the real human tragedy of our suffering The real commonality we all share as people even more now than we did a week ago When Americas imperialist leaders try to convince us to direct anger and vengeance toward this individual or that this group or that this nation or that one let us try to look at the real cause of the tragedy If we can get past the Voice of America CNN the New York Times BBC and all their satellite outlets maybe we can look for the root of the problem It is only then that we even have a chance of finding a cure The challenges of humanity can never be solved by trying to bomb or kill people into submission In the same way attempts to use the United Nations the International Monetary Fund the World Trade Organization or other socalled world bodies to legislate the majority of the world into accepting injustice will never succeed Elimination of human suffering can only come about through legitimate and honest humancentered education We have to seek an education that will enable us to truly understand our global interdependence an education that will lead to a new level of human enlightenment An enlightenment that enables us to see that when we lose loved ones to political violence in New York it is no different than when we lose loved ones to political violence in Freetown Belfast Sudan Somalia Palestine Iraq Afghanistan Panama Grenada and so many other places around the world where people have suffered at the hands of Americanled imperialism So as we rightly pray for and console the families of those innocents who lost their lives in New York let us also remember that as Dr Martin Luther King so eloquently stated Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere As long as there is injustice no one is safe We must fight to eliminate injustice only then will the violence subside When you kill someones mother or father or child is it not likely that some or one of the survivors may one day be bold enough to strike back at the one that they believe responsible Even to the point of killing his or herself in the process When we are bombarded with images rhetoric newspapers and even Email messages that encourage us to raise American flags and sing the praises of America we are witnessing and participating in a well orchestrated script designed to prepare us to blindly support retaliation against someone anyone Let us remember that those who will be killed in Americas next bombing exercise will be someones child someones mother someones fiancee someones school teacher Most people around the world would call it terrorism when bombs and missiles are mercilessly dropped on innocent people in Bagdad Kabul Tripoli Khartoum Hanoi or Hiroshima not only when they fall on America When we say terrorism must stop let us remind the American government and the people of America that all lives are sacred Please burn a candle for all of the victims of Americanled imperialism not just those killed in New York Pennsylvania and Washington DC on September If we want peace we must have justice Work for justice
