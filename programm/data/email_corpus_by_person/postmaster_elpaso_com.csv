XMSEmbeddedReport ContentType textplain charsetiso Thanks for the commnets Lynn Ive faxed you a copy of Plan B Ill let others chime in but ideally it seemsthat wed want to start the meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion But at a minimum wed want to get the process nailed down by very early next week Best Jeff LynnALednicky dynegycom To cc AM Subject Re Summary of Todays CallAgenda for Tomorrows Call Jeff Sorry I was unable to make the call yesterday Thanks for the summary My comments and questions are indicated below Please fax a copy of Plan B to be at You suggest starting the process in Sacramento next week Im not sure exactly what this means Are we saying we will have a proposal or that we will be advocating a processforum to get all the right parties at the table Did we set a time for the next call on Friday With regard to the Issues list here are a few extra items need to make clear that real price signals should be sent to all sectors not just those that wouldnt vote for Davis anyway as soon as possible I cannot imagine a situation in which the IOUs are returned to financial stability within months my guess is that it will be at least a year if IOUs are returned to the procurement role we need to make sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools ability to enter forward contracts options etc if IOUs are returned to the procurement role we also need to have assurances that the situation we have today wont happen again for example if the state assigns the CDWR contracts to the IOUs and three years from now the market price is less than the contract price what assurances does anyone have that the PUC will not try to make the IOUs absorb the difference If we want to go to a corenoncore approach why do we need to wait months it seems to me that we could start that process now As for legal claims and investigations we need to make clear that we want to resolve all state and federal claims the civil claims present a different set of challenges for resolution as for discounts on receivables Im not ready to commit one way or another however if there are discounts they must apply to all market participants not just the ones that Davis can get to the table Lynn on PM To LynnA ynegycom cc Subject Summary of Todays CallAgenda for Tomorrows Call Greetings n order to keep everyone in the loop the folks on todays call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldnt make it Apologies for any omissions inaccuracies etc Others who were on the call please chime in if Ive gotten anything wrong or missed anything Best Jeff SUMMARY Enron Duke El Paso and Williams were on the call as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group the Governors financial advisors On the subject of how the group would organize itself it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate A smaller group consisting of Duke El Paso Enron and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento meeting with policy makers and advocating whatever plan the group develops Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process that is the principals need to get in a room face to face for however long it takes to work out a resolution It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week and that it should take place in Sacramento It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible ie next week There was some discussion regarding the release today of Plan B Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison After that call I received a copy of Plan B If youd like a copy please send me your fax number Folks on the call agreed to have the next supplieronly callin meeting on Friday Finally Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ratings agency level presentation prepared by the end of the week The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates The Agenda for Tomorrows Call with the Governors Staff Item The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governors office wants to start tomorrows meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue Hoffman said that the Governors folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrows meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered If the draft is ready theyd like to discuss on the call tomorrow Item Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrows meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are The following is a brief outline which is not intended to be definitive but a starting point for discussion Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish realtime pricing implement demand buydown and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the powerbuying business as soon as possible eg once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness approximately months Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within months create a corenoncore market structure for electricity similar to Californias market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission generation etc Resolve outstanding legal claims investigations etc Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion
