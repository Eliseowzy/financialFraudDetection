not needed If you cannot turn off the entire computer turn off the monitor and the printer Disable the screensaver on your monitor and enable the power management tool on your PC Turn off lights in unoccupied rooms and halfdim lights in occupied rooms Send documents via email instead of fax Remove excess lights Many older office and warehouse buildings have more lighting then needed In many areas half the light may be sufficient to light the area When removing excess fluorescent tubes remember to disconnect the ballasts that serve them In the winter keep draperies and shades on southfacing windows open to allow sunlight to enter your home and close them at night to reduce the chill from cold windows For cell phone users charge your phone using a car adapter that hooks into the cigarette lighter instead of using the charger that plugs into a wall outlet Retrofit incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent CFL light bulbs Seventy percent of what comes off the watt bulb is heat not light If possible avoid using major household appliances washer dryer and oven during the peak periods of energy demand Install a clock thermostat You can program it to keep the temperature automatically set to degrees or less when the house is occupied and health permitting degrees or off at night Turn down the water heater temperature to the warm setting or about degrees and try to avoid wasting hot water Use coldwater wash cycle for more loads of laundry An electric toothbrush does not need to be plugged in all the time and wil l remain charged for days after being unplugged Connect your PC monitor fax machine and computer peripherals to one power strip and then turn off that power strip when not in use and every night Install separate switches for smaller areas Often in large buildings dozens of lights are controlled by a single switch and not all of them nee d to be on These lights can be rewired into smaller groups of lights on independent switches This way only those that are needed can be turned on Make sure warmair registers baseboard heaters and radiators are not blocked by furniture carpeting or drapes Switch off the drying cycle on your dishwasher Line dry your clothes instead of using a clothes dryer Reduce heating costs by closing a door to an unoccupied room or area that i s isolated from the rest of the office or house Dust off light bulbs Dirty greasy smoky light bulbs can reduce light output by as much as percent Youll avoid the tendency of switching to a stronger bulb which will use more energy Maintain the right temperature in your refrigerator and freezer Refrigerators can use up to of the total electricity in your home The refrigerator should be set between F C and F C The f reezer should be set between F C and F C Clean the condenser coils at least twice a year Dust and pet hair can buil d up and cause the refrigerator motor to work harder The coils are located o n the bottom or the backside of most models Take a shower instead of a bath The average bath uses twice as much hot water as a fiveminute shower Fax and copy only when really necessary Sometimes we take advantage of these common luxuries but there was a day when we didnt have them If you must make copies make all you need in one batch then turn the machine off if you know it wont be needed again soon Open freight doors only when needed When trucks are actively being loaded or unloaded leave the doors open As soon as the job is done close the doors to conserve energy Take the stairs instead of the elevator Youll save energy and get a little exercise to boot Turn your heaters down when youre using your fireplace and dont forget to close the damper when youre not using the fireplace Replace incandescent bulbs with fluorescent lamps and save on approximatel y percent of your lighting costs Always wash full loads in the dishwasher and airdry dishes on the energy saver setting Shorten the pumping cycle on your outdoor pool and shift it to offpeak demand times Enter and exit quickly Every time an exterior door opens a large amount o f heat escapes and cold air replaces it Open outside doors as little as possible and when you do do so quickly You also can use this as an excus e to send doortodoor solicitors on their way Switch off instant water heater in kitchen sink Circulate heated air Since warm air rises it tends to be trapped in the highest areas of your home A ceiling or portable fan running at a very low speed can help distribute warm air more evenly and reduce the desire to tur n the heat up Use task lighting If youre working diligently at a desk or workbench other light in the room could be turned off or dimmed Defrost food in the refrigerator Instead of defrosting food on the counter where it may spoil or in the microwave where it will use extra energy place it in the refrigerator hours before you need it This will help keep the temperature down in the refrigerator while it thaws Use microwaves for most cooking A microwave does small and medium cooking jobs more efficiently than an oven or range top Follow a recipe for suggested cooking time and dont cook foods longer than needed

conservation tips and incentive program s at epowerpageshomehtm Thanks for doing your part Justin Bradley Director of Energy Programs SVMG Turn off PCs monitors printers and copiers when not in use or not needed If you cannot turn off the entire computer turn off the monitor and the printer Disable the screensaver on your monitor and enable the power management tool on your PC Turn off lights in unoccupied rooms and halfdim lights in occupied rooms Send documents via email instead of fax Remove excess lights Many older office and warehouse buildings have more lighting then needed In many areas half the light may be sufficient to light the area When removing excess fluorescent tubes remember to disconnect the ballasts that serve them In the winter keep draperies and shades on southfacing windows open to allow sunlight to enter your home and close them at night to reduce the chill from cold windows For cell phone users charge your phone using a car adapter that hooks into the cigarette lighter instead of using the charger that plugs into a wall outlet Retrofit incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent CFL light bulbs Seventy percent of what comes off the watt bulb is heat not light If possible avoid using major household appliances washer dryer and oven during the peak periods of energy demand Install a clock thermostat You can program it to keep the temperature automatically set to degrees or less when the house is occupied and health permitting degrees or off at night Turn down the water heater temperature to the warm setting or about degrees and try to avoid wasting hot water Use coldwater wash cycle for more loads of laundry An electric toothbrush does not need to be plugged in all the time and wil l remain charged for days after being unplugged Connect your PC monitor fax machine and computer peripherals to one power strip and then turn off that power strip when not in use and every night Install separate switches for smaller areas Often in large buildings dozens of lights are controlled by a single switch and not all of them nee d to be on These lights can be rewired into smaller groups of lights on independent switches This way only those that are needed can be turned on Make sure warmair registers baseboard heaters and radiators are not blocked by furniture carpeting or drapes Switch off the drying cycle on your dishwasher Line dry your clothes instead of using a clothes dryer Reduce heating costs by closing a door to an unoccupied room or area that i s isolated from the rest of the office or house Dust off light bulbs Dirty greasy smoky light bulbs can reduce light output by as much as percent Youll avoid the tendency of switching to a stronger bulb which will use more energy Maintain the right temperature in your refrigerator and freezer Refrigerators can use up to of the total electricity in your home The refrigerator should be set between F C and F C The f reezer should be set between F C and F C Clean the condenser coils at least twice a year Dust and pet hair can buil d up and cause the refrigerator motor to work harder The coils are located o n the bottom or the backside of most models Take a shower instead of a bath The average bath uses twice as much hot water as a fiveminute shower Fax and copy only when really necessary Sometimes we take advantage of these common luxuries but there was a day when we didnt have them If you must make copies make all you need in one batch then turn the machine off if you know it wont be needed again soon Open freight doors only when needed When trucks are actively being loaded or unloaded leave the doors open As soon as the job is done close the doors to conserve energy Take the stairs instead of the elevator Youll save energy and get a little exercise to boot Turn your heaters down when youre using your fireplace and dont forget to close the damper when youre not using the fireplace Replace incandescent bulbs with fluorescent lamps and save on approximatel y percent of your lighting costs Always wash full loads in the dishwasher and airdry dishes on the energy saver setting Shorten the pumping cycle on your outdoor pool and shift it to offpeak demand times Enter and exit quickly Every time an exterior door opens a large amount o f heat escapes and cold air replaces it Open outside doors as little as possible and when you do do so quickly You also can use this as an excus e to send doortodoor solicitors on their way Switch off instant water heater in kitchen sink Circulate heated air Since warm air rises it tends to be trapped in the highest areas of your home A ceiling or portable fan running at a very low speed can help distribute warm air more evenly and reduce the desire to tur n the heat up Use task lighting If youre working diligently at a desk or workbench other light in the room could be turned off or dimmed Defrost food in the refrigerator Instead of defrosting food on the counter where it may spoil or in the microwave where it will use extra energy place it in the refrigerator hours before you need it This will help keep the temperature down in the refrigerator while it thaws Use microwaves for most cooking A microwave does small and medium cooking jobs more efficiently than an oven or range top Follow a recipe for suggested cooking time and dont cook foods longer than needed
