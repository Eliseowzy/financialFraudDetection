NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EnronAzurix Energy Management Services Agreement Thanks for the list of activities that will be performed for Azurix There are both US and Argentine tax issues that need to be addressed related to these services US Tax Issues Where will the services listed be performed Will the services be provided by an Enron affiliate or will they be subcontracted to third parties To the extent that the services are performed by Enron affiliates in Argentina there should be no issue with the income being subject to US tax However it should be noted that if an Enron Argentine entity provides the services but requires assistance from a US affiliate the income may be subject to US tax as well as Argentine taxes To avoid the US tax at the Argentine entity the Enron US entity could bill the Enron Argentine entity for services but the high Argentine withholding tax on services rendered in Argentina by offshore companies probably gives you a worse result Therefore we need to analyze the sourcing of the services to make sure that we have taken into account all possible US income tax exposure Argentine Tax Issues EAS I assume this is the new name for Enron International Argentina SA is a possible candidate for the entity to transact this business It has current losses and net operating loss carryforwards that would be utilized by any income generated by the EES activity Now is probably a good time to discuss with Argentine management the direction of the business to determine if EAS is an appropriate entity or whether we want to set up a special purpose entity I think that EAS is owned directly out of the US The only issue with using EAS is that it will be difficult to get any earnings generated by the EES project back to Corp or even out of Argentina for that matter difficult First it would be best to convert EAS from an SA to a limited company Secondly Enron Corp and Enron PIpeline Company which currently own of EAS would have to contribute their interests to a special purpose Cayman Island company This may or may not be able to be done without paying US tax If EAS has any appreciated assets such appreciation would be subject to US tax when contributed to the Cayman Island company Please arrange a time and we can discuss these issues in more detail Regards Lynn Andrea Calo PM To Lynn AvenENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re

Enron Tax has not been involved yet Brent Andrea and I tried to talk with Lynn Aven last week but unfortunately he was not available Also since the deal was only clearly outlined yesterday we didnt think it was necessary to pressure Lynn yet Initially we are thinking of using EAS however we will have to run it through tax first to see whether there are any tax implications If there are we will look into either creating an SPC or using an existing company if the corporate purpose allows Andrea B and I tried to contact you earlier today on the outside counsel issue but you were unreachable We spoke with Alberto Navarro Castex senior partner of AlfaroNavarro in Argentina which mainly works with the Exxel Group Andrea B met him some time ago at an event organized at Tozzini Freire in San Pablo since he is associated with this firm and thought his firm was of interest I have also met Alberto in the past and think his credentials are worth taking into account In addition to this the matter was discussed with Mike Guerriero and he believes that given the nature of the business being carried out by the Exxel Group in Argentina AlfaroNavarro would probably have the expertise to assist us in these transactions I just received their brochure which was faxed to the San Pablo office for your review Andrea and I would like to discuss this issue with Randy and you as soon as you

NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EnronAzurix Energy Management Services Agreement Thanks for the list of activities that will be performed for Azurix There are both US and Argentine tax issues that need to be addressed related to these services US Tax Issues Where will the services listed be performed Will the services be provided by an Enron affiliate or will they be subcontracted to third parties To the extent that the services are performed by Enron affiliates in Argentina there should be no issue with the income being subject to US tax However it should be noted that if an Enron Argentine entity provides the services but requires assistance from a US affiliate the income may be subject to US tax as well as Argentine taxes To avoid the US tax at the Argentine entity the Enron US entity could bill the Enron Argentine entity for services but the high Argentine withholding tax on services rendered in Argentina by offshore companies probably gives you a worse result Therefore we need to analyze the sourcing of the services to make sure that we have taken into account all possible US income tax exposure Argentine Tax Issues EAS I assume this is the new name for Enron International Argentina SA is a possible candidate for the entity to transact this business It has current losses and net operating loss carryforwards that would be utilized by any income generated by the EES activity Now is probably a good time to discuss with Argentine management the direction of the business to determine if EAS is an appropriate entity or whether we want to set up a special purpose entity I think that EAS is owned directly out of the US The only issue with using EAS is that it will be difficult to get any earnings generated by the EES project back to Corp or even out of Argentina for that matter difficult First it would be best to convert EAS from an SA to a limited company Secondly Enron Corp and Enron PIpeline Company which currently own of EAS would have to contribute their interests to a special purpose Cayman Island company This may or may not be able to be done without paying US tax If EAS has any appreciated assets such appreciation would be subject to US tax when contributed to the Cayman Island company Please arrange a time and we can discuss these issues in more detail Regards Lynn Andrea Calo PM To Lynn AvenENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re

Enron Tax has not been involved yet Brent Andrea and I tried to talk with Lynn Aven last week but unfortunately he was not available Also since the deal was only clearly outlined yesterday we didnt think it was necessary to pressure Lynn yet Initially we are thinking of using EAS however we will have to run it through tax first to see whether there are any tax implications If there are we will look into either creating an SPC or using an existing company if the corporate purpose allows Andrea B and I tried to contact you earlier today on the outside counsel issue but you were unreachable We spoke with Alberto Navarro Castex senior partner of AlfaroNavarro in Argentina which mainly works with the Exxel Group Andrea B met him some time ago at an event organized at Tozzini Freire in San Pablo since he is associated with this firm and thought his firm was of interest I have also met Alberto in the past and think his credentials are worth taking into account In addition to this the matter was discussed with Mike Guerriero and he believes that given the nature of the business being carried out by the Exxel Group in Argentina AlfaroNavarro would probably have the expertise to assist us in these transactions I just received their brochure which was faxed to the San Pablo office for your review Andrea and I would like to discuss this issue with Randy and you as soon as you get the chance to read the material Please give me a call if you have any further questions or comments Regards Andrea C Sami Arap PM To Andrea BertoneENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Andrea CaloENRON

purpose company to pursue EES type of deals in Argentina or have we already formed a SPC If Andrea Calo will be in Houston for the next two weeks and Andrea Bertone will be coordinating the prefeasibility legal studies of EnronOnLine in Brazil we need to approach Argentine counsel asap Please send me your thoughts with respect to local counsel as we need to discuss this issue shortly
