AM CST To James A nronXGate James nronXGate Mark E CT Rebecca nronXGate cc Federico nron Erwin nron Gabriela nron John nron Subject Re Notice of Meeting of Directors of TBS on March I thought it might be helpful to provide a little background on the reasons for the March board meeting By tomorrow morning Federico and his team will distribute talking points with details of the various matters listed on the agenda If you would find it useful Federico and I are available for an informational conferencecall in preparation for the board meeting which could be held on Friday March either at pm Houston time or at pm Houston time Please let us know of your preference TBS is a Cayman company whose principal purpose is to facilitate the supply of gas to the Cuiaba power plant in Brazil It is essentially a service company and its only assets are contractual rights related to the gas supply and transportation agreements Enron owns and Shell owns Until now the board has consisted of only Enron designees Shell has had a right to designate a board member since late and has recently designated Dr Johannes Walzebuck as their designee for TBS and to serve on other boards related to Cuiaba Until now the board functioned largely by unanimous written resolutions Shell is also minority shareholder of the assetowning entities related to the Cuiaba project EPE power plant co GasMat Brazilian side of pipeline spur and GasBol Bolivian side of pipeline spur Pursuant to various agreements Shell is obligated to fund its proportional share of the capital expenditures required to develop the project Essentially the agreements require that the parties consult from time to time to determine an Agreed Budget The project companies make monthly cash calls per the Agreed Budgets and the shareholders then fund the cash requirements Due to various construction problems and delays the main project entities EPE GasMat GasBol have seen significant increases in the proposed Agreed Budgets The once friendly operating relationship between Shell and the project companies has turned cold with Shell insisting on strict observance of contractual formalities objecting to proposed increases to the Agreed Budgets pending further consultations and defaulting on nearly MM of cash calls in the past few weeks Rebecca McDonald and Pete Weidler have become personally involved in discussions with senior representatives of Shell to resolve the problems It is these tensions with Shell that have led to us call for a live TBS board meeting instead of the more usual action by written resolutions We expect that Shell may vote against approving the budgets even though TBSs budget is quite small and has not increased beyond the level approved by Shell previously While Shell has a contractual right to object to increases at EPE GasMat GasBol and to decline to participate in further funding leading to their dilution they have no right to refuse to fund the obligations to which they have already agreed The board still can approve the budgets it deems necessary thus giving TBSs managers corporate authority to continue operations under the budgets Shell remains obligated to fund its proportionate share of the Agreed Budget for TBS notwithstanding any potential vote against the budget It is quite possible that Shell will not raise unnecessary obstacles in the TBS board meeting given the relatively small amounts at stake less than million Their real concerns lie in the asset owning companies However we must be prepared for potential noncooperation As indicated I understand that an informative presentation will be distributed to you late this evening and TBSs management will be available to answer your questions Friday afternoon If I can be of further assistance please let me know Best Regards Eddy Daniels Eddy Daniels PM To James nronXGate Mark E CT Rebecca nronXGate James A nronXGate cc Federico nron Nancy nron Denise AlmoinaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Notice of
