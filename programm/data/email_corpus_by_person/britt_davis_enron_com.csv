<19359463.1075861417017.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2001-11-19 09:41:29,In re FJ Representation Cc Chuck and I just got off the phone with Uriel Dutton about FJs representation FJs key concern appears to be a potential ethical conflict that may arise if a FJ continues to represent Enron Corp as it is currently doing with respect to IP matters and some asbestosis litigation and b FJ is tendered litigation or arbitration adverse to Enron Corp even if substantially unrelated to the current matters Dutton confirmed that he was aware of no such litigation or arbitration having been tendered to FJ Dutton advises that while under the Texas rules of ethics outside counsel can represent a party adverse to an existing client if the matters are not substantially related that is not necessarily true if the matter is in federal court in Texas or brought in the courts of other states Further even if a client such as Enron Corp is willing to give an advance general ethical waiver without knowledge of what future adverse matters FJ may take on such blind waivers my term are often not upheld Dutton believes however that with respect to matter handled for former clients it is generally the rule everywhere that there needs to be a substantial relationship between the matters for any potential ethical bar to arise In other words it sounds like FJ wants to remove at least Enron Corp from its list of current clients as soon as reasonably possible Dutton did say that with respect to the other FJ matters the bulk of which are related to Mariner there may be some accommodation that may be reached Dutton will speak further with his colleagues and get back with us I will call Prof Dzienkowski at the UT School of Law our speaker for many years at the Unit CLE ethics seminar and see if I can get some free advice about these issues I will of course only be speaking hypothetically I will keep you advised Britt

<15219959.1075861425937.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2001-11-26 11:03:10,In re FJ RepresentationBy telefax of November Uriel Dutton of FJ provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by handdelivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariners GC At present I am not sending this email to Mariners GC If there is someone else I need to send this email to please let me know Chuck and I have reviewed the letter believe it to be overly broad and hope that FJ is willing to negotiate further along the following lines On page third full paragraph second line we suggest inserting Enron Corp and between representation of and Enrons affiliates On page paragraph we are concerned about the third sentence which reads as follows Enron Corp agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of Enron Corp to comply with the agreements of the Enron Entities herein set forth We think although we do not know for sure that FJs concern is that FJ may become adverse in the future to some existing Enron entity that FJ does not currently represent or that does not currently exist and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on FJs current representation of Enron entities If this is the reason for the sentence we dont see how an existing Enron entity or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the Enron entity that is actually being represented We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp to cause all of its affiliates as defined in the letter agreement to comply with it Enron Corp may not have the power to require all its affiliates to comply Our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual Enron entities currently represented by FJ including Mariner On page lines from the top we find objectionable the language that begins Without limiting the foregoing It seems to us that here FJ wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though FJ is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter On pages paragraph we have a concern about the third sentence which reads as follows If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request it is expressly agreed and understood that FJ shall be entitled Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to an agreed course of action postmerger based on speculation as to what Dynegy may or may not do Our suggestion would be that we simply ask FJ to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement we are not requiring FJ to be liable for the rampup costs of new counsel for eg the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases in the event that Enron Corp cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pretrial We do not believe that rampup costs will be something FJ will agree to if we need FJ to take on the new Mariner matter Mariners GC called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether FJ was going to be able to represent Mariner on a new critical assetsale matter that is scheduled to close no later than December otherwise she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter Please let us have your comments as soon as possible Britt
<14732589.1075861426478.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2001-11-27 15:41:26,In re FJ Representation Cc Bob and I just spoke with Steve Susman I tried to mention the points you asked Here are his comments FJ probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson Susman believes that there is a hot potato rule that prevents FJ from doing so That being said Susman doesnt care if FJ represents Arthur Anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling Susman would not however agree to a broad advance ethical waiver as proposed by FJ He does not believe such waivers are effective Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who FJ wanted to represent I dont know whether FJ would agree to this or not Susman recognizes that we cannot force FJ to take on the new Mariner matter and that this is ultimately a riskbenefit decision for us to make and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldnt agree to Parenthetically I have received no comments on FJs proposed waiver letter Under the circumstances from his standpoint Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with FJ but that if FJ wont budge that we take something along the lines of what they have given us Bob let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts From my standpoint I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp agree to bind all the Enron entities and to the extent that it involves Enrons agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger as I set out in my earlier email My recommendation would be as set forth in my earlier email that only the Enron entities currently being represented by FJ sign it and be bound by it and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made I do not know whether FJ would be willing to make these changes or not Our biggest problem right now is timemanagement I know that Mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use I am willing to confer with Dutton ASAP to see what FJ would agree to and if he can agree in principle to send him a proposed draft agreement I believe he is out of the office but is checking his voicemail Please let me know what you want me to do Britt

will confirm that you have been retained on behalf of Enron Capital Trade Singapore Pte Ltd ECT in the abovereferenced alleged cargo contamination matter as its London solicitor Again you will be liaising with Neale Gregson of Watson Farleys office in Singapore who will continue to perform the factual development on this case for ECT subject to your direction and supervision Matt Lee ECTs inhouse attorney in Singapore will set up a telephone conference with you and Neale for some time tomorrow prior to opening of business in Houston In case you need to get in touch with him the telephone number I use for Matt is I believe Neals number is I will call you tomorrow at pm London time am Houston time to touch base with you FACTS The following is a thumbnail of the facts that have been reported to me I have not had a chance to run this summary past Matt and would be grateful for any corrections he might like to make ECT purchased a quantity of Elang Crude suitable for export from Phillips Petroleum Company Phillips and voyagechartered the MV PACIFIC VIRGO from Mitsubishi Corporation Mitsubishithe timecharterer to carry it from Phillips offshore loading facility in Indonesia to Thailand and the Phillipines for use by the buyer First Gas Power Corporation FGPC as compressor fuel There exists a longterm compressor fuel agreement between ECT and FGPC that contains several specifications that the product needed to pass The agreement between ECT and Phillips does not mention any of these specifications One of the specifications at issue from the ECTFGPC agreement is ASTM D which is used to test for the presence of certain metals According to ECTs surveyors ASTM D apparently does not produce test results that are sufficiently reproducible to be useful ECT has apparently been trying for some months to convince FGPC of this but without success FGPC reportedly advises that Seimens from whom it purchased the compressors at issue might void its warranty to FGPC if fuel is used that does not meet ASTM D A separate specification from the ECTFGPC agreement for sediments may also become at issue Months before the product at issue was loaded ECT had Elang Crude from this same facility tested to determine whether it would meet the FGPC specifications and found that the Elang Crude was onspec for ASTM D but offspec for sedimentation again a test separate and apart from ASTM D by almost double the allowed amount It is not clear why ECT decided to purchase product from Phillips despite this test It is unknown at this time whether this test included any of the product later loaded At some point prior to loading ECT did put the ship on notice that the cargo had to meet specifications for use as compressor fuel The ship responded by recommending that the tanks be Butterworthed at an extra cost per the CP to ECT of ECT declined apparently opting for a less expensive fresh water rinse Reportedly the ship then advised that it did not have sufficient fresh water to perform a fresh water as opposed to seawater rinse I am not sure what tank cleaning ultimately took place or who paid for it SGS ECTs surveyors did deliver a dry certificate to us before loading The ship loaded bbls per BL at the MODEC Venture Phillips floating offshore facility in Indonesia from June Testing of the shore tanks at loading revealed that the Elang Crude did meet the specifications in the FGPC contract ECT paid Phillips an FOB price of for the cargo After loading in Indonesia the ship then proceeded to Thailand where from June it offloaded bbls for storage for the eventual use of FGPC No quality testing of the product was apparently done aboard or ashore at that time The ship thereafter sailed to the Phillipines for offloading the remainder of the cargo Upon offloading in the Phillipines the cargo was found offspec for the presence of metals and sediment FGPC rejected the cargo Wilson Farley opined that FGPC was squarely within its contractual rights to do so ECT placed all potentially liable parties on notice and resold the cargo remaining on board to LG Caltex Caltex reportedly a Korean refinery on a CIF outturn basis for what I understand to be only a small approximately reduction in the value of the cargo ECT will not know exactly what it will be paid by the Korean refinery until the end of August as the purchase was based on an August price index That cargo discharged in Korea and received by Caltex directly into its crude oil storage facility on July It appears that Caltex did not do any quality inspection before this occurred No protest or objection to the quality of the cargo has been received from Caltex ECT is attempting to find another buyer for the Elang Crude currently in storage in Thailand as it is apparently unsuitable for FGPCs use there as well Matt will know whether that product has been tendered to and rejected by FGPC Mitsubishi has tendered an invoice for approximately freight for the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea and has submitted an invoice for approximately for demurrage for the voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines ECT has already paid approximately freight for the voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines Parenthetically two different charter parties were used one for the voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines and one for the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea A number of samples of the cargo were taken at the MODEC Venture in Thailand and the Phillipines at surveys that appear to have been jointly attended by ECT ECTs cargo underwriters and OwnersPI As I understand it the reports of the various analyses done to date are somewhat confusing A joint analysis is being planned to take place in Singapore Unfortunately the seals on a number of samples were broken by SGS our surveyors however my hope is that there are a number of other samples that can serve the same purpose ECT has also retained a Captain Sawant of PacMarine to act as an independent expert for us in this matter Captain Sawant has prepared a report and there is a Watson Farley memo containing notes of an interview of him As I understand his report Captain Sawant believes that the contamination probably took place aboard ship as a result of a inadequate cleaning of the tanks and b the cleansing properties of this condensate cargo A related issue of great importance to ECT is FGPCs position going forward regarding what I understand to be a longterm compressor fuel purchase agreement Under the agreement there are reportedly three alternative fuels which ECT may given certain conditions deliver to FGPC condensate gasoil and naptha Condensate is apparently the first choice but must meet ASTM D which ECT now feels is extremely difficult to do given the unreliability of the test Gasoil can reportedly only be used where ECT has been unable despite the use of due diligence to locate condensate that meets ASTM D If FGPC accepts gasoil as a substitute however then FGPC is responsible for paying a substantial tax on it that does not apply to condensate Naptha will reportedly cause ECT to lose money because of its lower Btu content Because of the problems with the MV PACIFIC VIRGO product ECT has reportedly contacted FGPC about accepting gasoil as a substitute I have heard that this will cause FGPC to become liable for a tax in the range of although this has not been confirmed Before agreeing to accept gasoil FGPC has requested a letter advising what due diligence efforts ECT has performed in order to secure product that does meet its specs Parenthetically I ask that Matt remind me who the ECT trader was who actually did this deal URGENT ISSUES Who to use as ECTs experts Neale has recommended Captain Richard Gregory of Noble Denton and Dr Eric Mullen of Burgoynes I do not know whether Neale intends to use Captain Sawant who has reportedly never testified I feel that the quality of ECTs experts will be of great significance in this case and want to make sure that whoever we use can in your opinion command the respect of a London arbitration tribunal in a proceeding against the ship or if necessary against the cargo underwriters If that means getting a Londonbased expert lets discuss it and get this issue resolved before the joint survey that is being scheduled to take place in the Phillipines Resolving ECTs insurance claim As you know Cliff Bennett of Mintons the same firm that Enron is using as its experts in the MV HAVMANN matter is following this matter for ECTs cargo underwriters I am told that Bennett has not been told by us about the presale product sampling My concern is that once he finds out he and the ship will raise inherent vice as a defense Please take a look at the cargo policy that I will be sending you by courier and a advise of any coverage issues you see and b give us your thoughts as to the best way of resolving ECTs claim quickly Whether ECT should file for arbitration before the ship does so You mentioned that the ship is likely to file an arbitration demand in the near future and seek an interim award of its freight claim Given that I would like your recommendation in very short order as to whether ECT should wait for that to happen and file a counterclaim or proceed with filing an original demand Whether ECT can raise the doctrines of impossibility of performance or frustration of performance or some other legal theory to challenge the use by FGPC of the ASTM D specification in this matter ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION This afternoon I will be faxing certain key documents to you and will send the rest by courier I am also asking that Matt telefax to you copies of the following documents Matt I apologize if you have already sent them to me ECTs purchase agreement with Phillips ECTs longterm agreement to supply fuel to FGPC and purchase orders or the like that particularly relate to this cargo A copy of the first charter party as soon as it is sent to us Anything which reflects the terms of the second charter party David we appreciate your availability and look forward to working with you Regards Britt Davis

need to get John Nowlans authority he is the ultimate business client before we send this message to Mitsubishi I am trying to meet with him tomorrow to get that authority Ill keep you closely advised as to my progress BKD Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM PM To cc Subject MV PACIFIC VIRGO Thanks for the detailed information you gave me in our lengthy telephone conversations today and the exchange of views I have not finished reading all the documents yet and set out some preliminary thoughts to cover the areas we discussed Experts I have no problem with Richard Gregory provided he is the one who does the work As for Dr Mullen of Burgoynes I do have some reservations He is principally in my view a fire expert whilst acknowledging he does have chemistry knowledge I wonder if he is the right man for a technical oil chemistry job My preferred choice is Mr Steve Jones of APC Petroleum in the UK I have used him before and found him clever and objective I know that John Minton for whom I have a high regard regards him well Britt has said that it is important we take the right decision here even if it means sending a UK chemist out to Singapore to attend the joint sampling Mr Jones therefore has my recommendation A potential problem is that he is on holiday from today returning to the office on Tuesday morning He is fairly available after then Since it is unlikely that the joint testing will take place this week nor the very early part of next week perhaps this is not a problem I assume the joint testing will be proceeded by agreement between the relevant nominated experts to the test programme Mr Jones if he is appointed can deal with this in the UK by liaising with Mr Bennett of MTD whom he knows and others I wonder if SGS should also be shown a proposed test programme and they should also attend the joint testing My own thinking is that Mr Bennett of MTD should perhaps prepare a test programme but you may have already dealt with this and taken other decisions Claim against time charterers I have looked at the advices Priority should be given to understanding fully the exchanges on the charterers cleaning instructions It may be worthwhile taking a statement from Enrons charterers representation who was responsible for giving the instructions and corresponding with owners It does seem that Enron was annoyed that the vessel did not have sufficient fresh water on board to carry out a water rinse which Enron wanted to order the vessel to carry out It seems that the vessel simply said that this was not an option because they did not have sufficient fresh water on board leaving Enron with no alternative but to load on top with strippingdraining encouraged perhaps by owners comment that the last cargo was Cossack crude and the loading operation was load on top basis ie no tank cleaning was performed prior to loading the cargo I think we need to explore carefully these telex exchanges before coming to a final view on the vessels responsiblity for the contamination assuming it is agreed that the cargo damage is attributable to the vessel and lack of cleaning a point MTD will be closely looking at with respect to the claim under the policy that underwriters anticipate At the moment these telex exchanges look favourable FreightDemurrage A long with others I agree that we should not pay this to time charterers Probably the time has arrived where we should be sending a message along the lines that the freight for the second leg and demurrage has been occasioned solely as a result of time charterers breach of their charter obligation Put simply cargo was delivered to them in a sound condition and discharged in a contaminated condition most probably because the tanks were not fit and suitable for the carriage of the cargo In our message perhaps we can suggest that further discussion on the matter should be put on hold until the outcome of the joint testing and the parties should be guided accordingly by the outcome In the event of any continuing disagreement the dispute will have to be resolved in arbitration Personally I think it may well be difficult to resist an application for an interim award for freight since it will be argued that freight for the second leg was paid on existing charterparty terms that I think provides that payment should be made without discount I think I am right in saying there was no separate charterparty entered into and we will also have to take a closer look at the messages with owners when the second leg was discussed The claim for demurrage will be easier to resist assuming it is attributable to the contamination Any demurrage that is not attributable to the contamination should probably be paid Claim against head owners under BL For reasons discussed we should explore the possibility of an arrest Britt would like WFW to ask Ang Partners if they are conflicted out and also how much it will cost to arrest including how much monies are to be advanced prior to securing an arrest Ang Partners are not to be instructed yet Your contract with FGPC This appears to be unrelated to the contamination in the sense that I note the cargo passed D with ashing methods used and failed on th July both with ashing and plain D methods For reasons probably connected with Siemens FGPC refuse to amend the contract which is obviously the sensible thing to do I assume by the way SGS are right when they say that ashing is a modification of the test method as opposed to a preparatory step or addition ie are SGS right in saying that the test method has not been complied with if ashing is used It may be that the way to look at this is to focus on mitigation It is obvious that Enron are boxed in and cannot find a condensate that using this test method will generate an accurate result It is hit and miss I have nof formed a view on how to proceed yet and am anxious to get this email off to you as it stands Regards DAVID BEST Please

we have an argument but it is too early to tell whether we have the better argument BKD Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM PM To cc Subject mv PACIFIC VIRGO From David Best You asked for a preliminary opinion following our telephone conference this morning on Enrons contractual remedies and exposures on the FGPC contract I am afraid the matter is complex and there is no straightforward answer First we should start with the contract which I have now read I am assuming the NDC date has passed but not the conversion date Article is an acknowledgment by the seller that the buyers preference is for condensate because of favourable tax considerations There is however an unfettered option given by Article to Enron to deliver alternative liquid fuel in the form of gasoil or naphtha meeting the quality specifications The quality specifications for liquid fuel are set out in Appendix A Article under the abbreviation T provides for a liquid fuel tax differential which is a price burden falling on Enron as part of the price formulation However in the event seller is unable to deliver condensate using reasonable commercial efforts but supplies another type of liquid fuel instead T shall be deemed to be zero for the first barrels in the aggregate of such other types of liquid fuel delivered in a contract year Other relevant Articles are buyers right to secure alternative supplies the whole of Article sellers default the whole of Article determination of quantity and quality mitigation of losses and a buyer shall be under no obligation to accept delivery of any quantity of liquid fuel which fails to meet the quality specifications No doubt there are other relevant Articles but the above seem the important ones to me The facts have been summarised already in numerous emails and correspondence and I certainly will not repeat them except to say that I think it is correct that It is simply not possible to buy condensate applying test method D for condensate For this reason for example your contract with Phillips Brothers for the PACIFIC VIRGO did not include this test method SGS consider D is wholly inappropriate for condensate and have said that modifying D with ashing is the preferred method to achieve higher reproduceability Indeed the previous two cargoes of condensate supplied to FGPC have been tested using ashing The gasoil has been nominated for August to replace the contaminated Elang arguably because of the lack of lead time to find suitable cargo of condensate but more probably because the trader in question understandably is concerned that a substitute condensate cargo may fail if the plain D test method is used FGCP have said in a recent email dated th July that FGCP will not hesitate to reject any cargo which fails to meet the guaranteed specification and which offers any possibility of invalidating any guarantees or warranties given by Siemens They are therefore not prepared to entertain any amendment to the contract Following our telephone conference and having read the contract I saw problems for Enron and decided to share my thoughts with John Lockey of Essex Court Chambers He is the barrister specialising in such problems often used by me and the firm for second opinions and obviously helpful on a case such as this We debated the subject at length and came to the following tentative conclusions which I shall put in bullet form He and I are available for discussion at am tomorrow at my office and I propose to call you at that time to hear your comments and to deal with any questions you may have on the following We think that it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts to justify zero tax for the first barrels of other types of liquid fuel in any contract year It seems to us that this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into and is not designed to provide effectively a letout because the contract simply cannot be complied with at all from its start FGPC will simply argue with some prospect of success that they entered into the contract and agreed its terms regarding pricing etc on the basis that Enron was able to supply condensate applying D This squares with what they have said in their recent email which I have quoted above The same email goes on to say The allowance for barrels was built into the LFPC to act as a safety valve only to be used should circumstances demand it If we are right about what we say above this means that Enron are in the invidious position of having to source condensate to avoid the tax not knowing whether it is going to meet D If SGS test using D and fail the cargo the contract supposedly gives FGPC an entitlement to reject Their cover costs could include gasoil with its additional tax as a cost since there is no available condensate for sale on the market applying D assuming we are right about this assumption in above It occurs to us that it may be possible to argue with some merit that Appendix B has to be construed to imply a term that D only applies to condensate if it is truly applicable to that grade You will note that Appendix B sets out a test method in one column and three grades gasoil naphtha and condensate in other columns If SGS are right that the test method is inappropriate they should not be testing against D for condensate Putting it another way the condensate could be on spec applying the appropriate ashing method and the test method set out in Appendix B will not necessarily determine this As you say it is hit and miss Objectively the intention of the parties must be to apply the appropriate test method or not to apply a test method if it is not capable of determining the contractual specification Applying this reasoning it means that Enron are not in breach by supplying a cargo of condensate in circumstances where the D test is simply not carried out because contractually it cannot apply As we say above we think SGS should not be carrying out this test at all if it is entirely inappropriate Indeed SGS who are jointly appointed should be instructed by Enron not to carry out the test There is some force for this in Article a which says that measurement of quantities and taking of samples for the purposes of determining the quality of liquid fuel in each shipment should be carried out in accordance with international standard practice at the time of the shipment in question It is not completely on point since the clause does not deal specifically with testing In the event that SGS confirm it is inappropriate to carry out the test and they simply do not test the buyer will be left without any test certificate that shows the cargo has failed to meet the quality specifications Should subsequently the buyer test on his own under D and it fails whilst SGS independently apply the ashing method and it passes we believe the buyers will be in difficulties in maintaining a lawful rejection Before this angle is pursued we think SGS should be contacted to confirm the test method is inappropriate We also think it is important that you and we have sight of the exact wording of the test method to see whether on its face it is inappropriate for condensate This would help to reinforce the contention that it is inapplicable to condensate in Appendix B Finally I should like to have sight of the Appendix Typical laboratory condensate analyses that is attached to the fuel supply plan that you faxed yesterday We look forward to speaking to you at am tomorrow Regards David Best Please reply to This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they

David asked to help him given the urgency and complexity of this dispute Deborah please print out and file BKD Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on AM AM To cc Subject mv PACIFIC VIRGO From David Best Following our telephone conference this morning the following advice can be given Please treat this advice as the joint advice of myself and Counsel John Lockey We give it in bullet form for the purposes of clarity The terms of the ASTM D do support the view that it is inappropriate to apply D to condensate The fact remains however that the contract defines the contractual specification by reference to D On the face of it Enron has promised a specification in accordance with test method D and has agreed to assume the risk tht the condensate does not satisfy the specification when tested in accordance with D The terms of Appendix to the Fuel Supply Plan seem to us to make it much more difficult to argue that the reference in Appendix B of the contract fo D means only that D applies to condensate to the extent that it is appropriate to use D for condensate The fact that Enron reported test results for condensate in Appendix to the Fuel Supply Plan by reference simply to test method D makes it very difficult to argue that when the parties concluded the contract they would have had in mind that D applies only to gasoil and would not apply or would only apply with modifications to condensate The terms of the Fuel Supply Planand of Appendix make it even more difficult to argue that the impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts Even though Enron is not contractually committed to the terms of the Fuel Supply Contract the fact is that Enron put forward typical specifications for condensate by reference to D The Fuel Supply Plan reemphasises the importance to the buyer of being provided with condensate in preference to naptha or gasoil Our understanding of SGS advice to Enron is that D does not envisage ashing and that it would be wrong to report a result by reference to test method D if the sample had been ashed before testing Should SGS provide a test certificate certifying a specification which is outside contractual specification applying Dwith a notation that condensate falls outside the scope of D as they suggest the buyers will still be able to reject because any verification is final conclusive and binding on the parties provided there is no manifest error If it is the case that applying D without any modifications to the ASTM methodology to portions of the sample condensate provided to the independent inspector would or may well produce different results in ppm for the same sample because of the volatility of condensate it seems to us to be strongly arguable that the independent inspector aware that his certification of noncompliance will be binding under the contract should simply refuse to certify a test result by reference to D It seems to us to be difficult in those circumstances for the inspector to conclude that a particular test result is reliable Furthermore if it is the case that it is not practically possible to certify quantities of elements below ppm using D on condensate then again the independent inspector should refuse to certify at those levels If the independent inspector refuses to certify by reference to D the buyer will have to decide whether to reject and take his chances of demonstrating that in fact the condensate was offspec by reference to D The absence of a certificate of compliance with specification does not seem to us to justify rejection If the buyer decides to reject an arbitrator would have to decide on all the evidence whether the cargo was offspec as measured by D The buyer would be running the risk that he could not justify the rejection with a potential exposure to Enrons costs It would be prudent in those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using D methodology in order to present an average and hopefully onspec result to counteract the test results produced by the buyer It would also be prudent in those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using SGS preferred method of testing condensate as these results could be used by Enron to require the buyer to take a rejected cargo in mitigation of the buyers loss or to submit to the arbitrators that the buyer should have mitigated by accepting retender of the rejected cargo when accompanied by an independent inspectors certification that the specs were met by reference to the much more appropriate methods for testing Contractually it is almost certainly not open to Enron to refuse to agree on the appointment of an independent inspector or to insist that the independent inspector should not test the sample of condensate using method D unless there are modifications to that method when applied to condensate However there does not appear to be any objection to Enron advising in advance that because the independent inspectors certificate is intended to be binding under the contract the independent inspector should not provide a result by reference to D unless satisfied that that result is truly representative of the qualities of the sample Turning to Enrons exposure to a tax liability on the nomination and shipment of gasoil we repeat our advice given in our e mail of nd August that it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts to justify zero tax It seems to us that this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into The onus is on Enron to demonstrate that it has used reasonable commercial efforts It is likely in our view that FGCP will set off against price a sum equivalent to the tax liability so that Enron is out of pocket with the regard to the nominated gasoil Unless Enron wishes to manage the contract by risking a rejection dispute each time condensate is delivered assuming SGS do not certify Enron may want try to renegotiate the contract It may be that the point we have raised in concerning the risk of an unlawful rejection by the buyer may be helpful in any such renegotiation Regards David Best PLEASE REPLY TO This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for

PRODUCT Matt Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best given that we already put underwriters on notice that there was contamination and given that we have worked closely with Mintons underwriters representatives I would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place in fact it looks like the final determination of ECTs total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey although I would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum The policy specifically requires under INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS that ECT file a claim in writing against the delivering carrier holding him responsible as soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is not apparent details can be furnished later Such action will not prejudice your insurance claim Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent policy I have already sent a copy to David I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the

Please see below Cliff Bennetts recommendations for joint testing I spoke briefly with Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in Thailand He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some time end Augustearly September premised on delivery and acceptance of the first Elang cargo and subject to First Gass consumption Cargo still not sold Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price but will be giving it somethought to arrive at an estimate The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec but principal reason for not delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D as a test method Summary of Thailand samples test results July Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue and Filterable Dirt Filterable Dirt was off spec at Carbon Residue was off spec at SGS Thailand suggested that the Carbon Residue result was questionable and recommended retesting There were however no other ship composite samples taken before discharge in Thailand Shoretank samples tested by

To Matthias Lee cc Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Matthias As per my email dd rd August to Eric from cargo Interests viewpoint it is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options open as possible Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of establishing the cause To that end I would recommend that you provide the other Parties with the test methods ASTM Dnumbers and state that these tests will be applied to retain samples from each of Pacific Virgo before after loading Australia all cargo Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Batangasnominated tanks if samples available Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Thainominated tanks Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas the samples upon which First Gas based their rejection Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas including bottom samples Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea including bottom samples Pacific Virgo any other samples that are available and that might progress the investigation Some testing may involve composites some individual samples This will to a degree depend on the labs ability to get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite If that cant be done it will have to be individuals Insofar as identifying the particulates should this prove necessary I think we need to keep all options open While it is always possible to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise better to keep the Parties together if possible But not at the expense of limiting the analysis ability to determine cause I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly But if you limit at the beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary it can all prove meaningless I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this It is in noones interest to do testing just for the sake of it and as far as I am concerned that is not on my agenda nor I am sure is it on Enrons But we must be realistic Depending upon the size of your potential claim have Underwriters been put on notice yet by the way it might be worth spending several K to get to the root of the matter rather than less

Samples for Testing Dear Cliff Would you be able to draw up a test programme based on your recommendations below with the view to circulate it to all parties including SGS for their agreement prior to joint testing I think such a preagreed programme would be most useful and would avoid any dispute on testing procedure subsequently Eric expects all the samples to arrive in Singapore within the next couple of days and send out the notice to all parties to attend joint testing sometime between August Thanks and best regards Matt Lee Forwarded by Eric TanSINECT on clifford bennett on To Eric Tan cc Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Eric My recommendations concerning joint testing are as follows Samples Ideally at least one set of sealed integrity traceable chain of custody samples from each stage of the shipment should be available at the joint testing The samples will be checked against the appropriate sampling records prior to testing If possible I think we should have samples from Loading Australia one set Pacific Virgos tanks after loading Discharge Thailand one set predischarge vessels tanks Thai parcel if the other Batangas tanks were sampled at this time these samples should be included Batangas one set vessels tanks on arrival plus one set vessels tanks from the most recent sampling before the vessel departed Batangas to include dead bottom samples Korea one set predischarge vessels tanks on arrival including any dead bottom samples Depending on exactly what samples are available testing may encompass both composites and in some cases individual tank samples where particulates are involved the composition of individual tank samples even in a laboratory can destroy the representivity of a sample This by the way is the reason for my concerns over sample decanting in Philippines evidence can be lost Testing I would suggest the laboratory of SGS Singapore because that is where the samples are being collated Provided the testing can be done to the appropriate standard and the methods are available any laboratory would do As advised previously the laboratory tests and the witnesses are there to ensure among other things that all is above board Test schedule As advised previously the basic methods I would recommend are Carbon residue ASTM D Carbon residue bottoms ASTM D Ash ASTM D BSW ASTM D V Na K Ca Pb ASTM D Filterable dirt ASTM D Please note that for filterable dirt ASTM D is not applicable as it is designed for insitu line samples ASTM D is a laboratory method that is essentially equivalent Both methods are intended for particulates in aviation fuels Anyway SGS Singapore can run ASTM D The above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples it will almost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples in duplicate Duplicates are necessary because standalone results are always open to doubt In any event duplicates are often a requirement of the test method and any reputable laboratory will run duplicates as a matter of course Duplicate samples should not mean twice the price Investigative testing This is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will be necessary To a degree it will be guided by what is found in the above spec testing My initial recommendation would be to check the solubility of the particulates particularly in aromatic solvent to check if organic and possibly in acid to check if inorganic If as has so far been reported the particulates are not aromatic solvent soluble and because they do not appear to contribute to the ash content of the fuel a best guess might be that they are carbon particles However we need to keep an open mind on this We might need to think about microscopy visible or electron on the particles Possibly also look at elemental analysis of the particles by eg energy dispersive Xray analysis I will give some further thought to what might be required by way of investigative analysis and revert At this stage I suggest that all options on the investigative side are kept open OwnersPI might not agree but realistically we cannot predict what we will find or what might need to be done until we start getting some spec test results and some simple particle solubilities done I trust this helps Please keep me advised regarding samplesjoint test matters Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd

same page as Janice with regard to testing although Id like to spin out my thoughts a bit In my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both D with ashing and D without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis Mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons Prior to the joint analysis Mitsubishi will be aware that a D without ashing is in the FGH contract and that b ECT believes D without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product Given this if ECT proposes to use only D with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D without ashing The same would apply I think if even if ECT proposed to use only D without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis The more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec Mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT to credibly take the position that only one test or the other D with ashing or D without ashing should be run in fact in light of what I believe is virtually inevitable Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to Mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi and not the other way around Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in Singapore I know that we nominated SGS Singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using SGSs lab As Janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with D with and without ashing Also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of the presale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo This latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with SGS about any of this I would suggest that you first confer with David or Neal Many thanks for your help Britt Again many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM Janice R CT AM To Britt NRON cc Alan CT Deborah nron Harry M CT Matthias CT Michael A CT Richard B CT Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt I agree w Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same method used at loadport regardless of whether ashing is proper or not Not for the reason you mention Mitsubishi may well argue about proper rejection but thats not likely a viable argument since the fact is that First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds for that rejection but for the sake of consistency It doesnt matter at all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo its no longer any of their concern Its Enrons risk and sole responsibility to deal w costs following rejection per the contract I hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or will happen on

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have

from the US of course Andrews email address is I appreciate any help you can give us at your negotiations on Wednesday with Exmar The best of all possible worlds is if both EGLI and Exmar could agree to withdrawdismiss their claims against each other and walk away from this case before year end If you wouldnt mind I would appreciate a short email from you regarding Exmars response during your meeting with them Many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM PM To cc Subject SANTA CLARA Britt I would summarise the main factsstatus of this matter as follows Enron voyage chartered SANTA CLARA from Exmar NV by a CP dated to carry cargo of mt more or less at owners option of propane from Houston to Dunkirk Under the Charterparty Enron had the option to load cargo either fully refrigerated or ambient or chilled On th February the Master advised Enron that the maximum quantity that the cargo could load at ambient temperature was mt having regard to the vessels pressure settings and the USCG and IMO Rules and Regulations The Master was in fact absolutely correct but Exmar tried to make out that the vessel could load the full charterparty quantity It is our case that in order to load more than mt the cargo was loaded at ambient temperature Exmar refrigerated the cargo as it came on board to reduce the volume This caused the loading to be excessively slow We say this method of loading was actually illegal It was only by loading illegally in this way that Exmar could load more than mt at the required pressure setting We also say it was an express term of the charterparty that the entire contractual cargo could be loaded within the contractual lay time The vessel also had to raise the temperature and discharge causing further delays There was great commerical pressure on Enron at the time The market for propane was falling rapidly in March the end of the Northern European winter and Enron had arranged the on sale of a minimum quantity of mt on CIF terms based on an expected loading of stth March Enron were extremely concerned that this would lead purchasers Vitol to repudiate the sale contract leading to a very substantial trading loss Vitol did try to repudiate the sale contract due to the loading delays and this developed into a very major trading dispute with Vitol which we eventually won in the House of Lords Exmar made out that slow loading was due to low back pressure in his Enterprise loading lines We believe this is wrong but at this distance in time it is difficult to get clear evidence In the circumstances on th March to try and speed up loading Enron agreed that the minimum cargo of mt should be loaded and agreed to pay Exmar deadfreight on the balance in the sum of US Furthermore because of the slow loading of the vessel the Enterprise Terminal had to throw SANTA CLARA off berth This would have caused a very substantial delay and might have justified Vitol in throwing over the sales contract In the circumstances Enron negotiated an agreement with another vessel DONAU to permit SANTA CLARA to be loaded ahead of DONAU The sum paid to DONAU amounted to US We believe the DONAU was also operated by Exmar Accordingly Enron deny liability for demurrage for the extended loading which Exmar have claimed in the sum of US and Enron have counterclaimed a total of US ie the deadfreight and DONAU payments Exmar are represented by London Solicitors Lawrence Graham where the matter is being handled by Mike Lax and his assistant Stuart Dench Lawrence Graham have always sought to charactercise this claim as a straightforward demurrage dispute and suggest that we have invented the technical arguments after the event However we consider there is merit in our case and that if the arbitrators properly understand the expert evidence we have reasonable prospects of successfully defending the demurrage claim and establishing the counterclaim There is of course however an inevitable litigation risk in pursuing the matter to an arbitration and we have to some extent been inconvenienced by the loss of our original expert Mr Ivor Jorstad who sadly passed away earlier this year Also some costs will be irrecoverable if we win approximately two thirds of our costs should be recoverable If you have any further queries please do not hesitate to ring me and I would of course be pleased to speak

Matt if any of this appears inaccurate to you dont hesitate to point it out The pending joint survey a The joint survey has yet to be scheduled The reason for the delay is an issue concerning whether SGSs Singapore laboratory has the resourcescompetence to carry out the joint analysis Steve Jones ECTs choice of chemist is communicating with SGS in order to make this determination Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing Jones feels strongly that it will be most costeffective for ECT to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination I and Matt have personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT is looking for the quickest most costeffective resolution to this dispute with Mitsubishi Because of the issue with SGS Jones has waited until now to send the proposed testing program to Technichem Mitsubishis choice of surveyorchemist in a previous report I mentioned that the testing program had already been sent to Technichem this now turns out not to be the case By today Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem in order to get the ball rolling and with the expectation that Technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate b If things go well with SGS Jones anticipates scheduling a joint analysis about twothree weeks from now Jones plan to personally attend the joint survey on our behalf given the complexity of the testing methods Even after that testing Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessels inert gas system Costs a Surveyorschemists Jones advises that to date he and his firm have spent a total of about days at pounds per day for a total of approximately pounds or roughly at the current USDpounds exchange rate of pound Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard now with ITSCaleb Brett who specializes in the type of testing at issue Jones estimates that Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter at a daily rate of lbs or Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey begins he will spend about two more days and Goddard will spend about another onehalf day This totals about pounds or For the actual joint testing Jones estimates that he will spend about twelve days straight including transit time Goddard would not attend but would be available by telephone if Jones had a question Twelve days time amounts to pounds or not including aire fare room and board Afterwards for the additional testing in England to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt Jones estimates another pounds for the cost of the lab he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure which he believes could be completed in about two days If he attended both days this additional testing in England would run to another pounds or b Other experts SGS and Caleb Bretts costs to date are being compiled by Matt SGS will spend another SGD purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing and bill for another SGD for prejointanalysis development work basically practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO This comes to a total of SGD or about to prepare for the joint analysis based on the current reported SGDUSD exchange rate of SGS estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD or about Captain Sawant of PacMarine one of our ship operations experts will be charging us SGD or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report Captain Gregory of Noble Denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time c Attorneys David Best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about This is subject to being adjusted up or down once Best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill I imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on the FGH issue Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing Neale Gregsons firm Watson Farley has incurred fees and expense to date of SGD or about Matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter Matt will be asking Gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter My and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately This also includes time spent on the FGH matter although pursuant to Alans instructions I am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised d Summary of Costs In sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date and once David Best comes back from vacation on September and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the FGH matter Another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in Singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in London after the joint analysis is done if Steve Jones determines that such further testing is necessary Recent Sale of Thailand cargo a You will recall that the bulk of the product from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to FGH given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines which was tendered to FGH who rejected it Samples from the shore tanks in Thailand have recently been tested by SGSs laboratory in the US and reportedly found on spec All of the Thailand product has recently been sold to Caltex Singapore for delivery September reportedly for use in Caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by Caltex very low b Unfortunately Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index Lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the Elang crude ECT has sustained until then We were previously told that the product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about For my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand I am using the working hypothesis that ECTs total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO is in the range of Again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate Expert witness supplemental opinion At my request Captain Sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ECTs instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water Captain Sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred While we can protect Captain Sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue Despite this however ECT still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi

acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the abovereferenced new matter which concerns a thirdparty attachment of a load of aluminum worth about million and owned by MG Metals I read the file you gave me and have spoken with Arthur Taylor the inhouse attorney for MG USA who was monitoring this file Tim Mullin and Scott Haiber our outside counsel at Miles Stockbridge in Baltimore and Martin Stanley the London trader whose deal this was I will shortly be receiving a complete copy of Miles Stockbridges correspondence and pleading files You have already sent to me various emails in this matter which I understand that Martin had forwarded to you FACTS AND STATUS Briefly stated the significant facts are as follows On June Base Metals obtained an ex parte attachment order from the US District Court for the District of Maryland Northern Division for a cargo of aluminum previously purchased by MG Metals from a third party and being discharged in the Port of Baltimore Base Metals contends that the attachment was required because a the aluminum was actually still owned by OJSC a Russian smelter and the only named defendant in the underlying suit or b that the aluminum had been fraudulently conveyed to MG Metals However MG Metals has never been listed as a defendant in the case The aluminum was in fact attached by Base Metals per the order The underlying lawsuit by Base Metals a trading company against OJSC the Russian smelter seeks to confirm an international arbitration award obtained in Moscow late last year of approximately That arbitration reportedly arose out of the breach by OJSC of a long term output contract between OJSC and Base Metals pursuant to which Base Metals apparently had the right to market most or all the production from OJSC That breach has reportedly put Base Metals virtually out of business OJSC has reportedly very recently been served by Base Metals with the Maryland federal lawsuit but has not appeared On July the Court granted MG Metals emergency motion to allow the sale of the aluminum provided that the sale proceeds were placed into an interest bearing escrow account Reportedly all the previouslyattached aluminum has been sold and approximately million of sales proceeds have been deposited into the escrow account Additional sale proceeds are anticipated to be deposited in the near future with the total running in the range of about million On July MG Metals served a motion to vacate the order establishing the escrow account and a request for an expedited hearing The first reason set forth in the motion is that Base Metals could not prove that OJSC owned the metal given that MG Metals is shown as the shipper on the relevant straight bills of lading has all the necessary purchase and sale documents from an intermediate buyer and has reportedly paid fair market value to that intermediate buyer for the aluminum The second reason is that MG Metals solvency obviates the need for an escrow account Base Metals has filed a response with supporting affidavits contending that the aluminum was fraudulently transferred to MG Metalsand that MG Metals was actually aware of this This awareness allegedly arose at least in part as the result of a warning from a representative of Base Metals to a representative of MG Metals about the takeover of the Russian smelter through a corruption of the Russian bankruptcy process by Russian competitors in the metals business For strategy reasons even though MG Metals advises that this conversation never took place and that all it was aware of were rumours that frequently come out of Russia MG Metals has not chosen to file affidavits controverting its alleged knowledge This is because Base Metals lead law firm in Philadelphia is composed primarily of Russian immigrants and appears to be tied to a law firm located in Russia Clearly Base Metals is better prepared than us to obtain information from Russia For that reason we are trying to keep turning this case into a swearing match about what MG Metals knew was happening in Russia by focusing on other arguments such as the solvency argument Along these lines MG Metals will also shortly file a supplemental pleading arguing that Base Metals failed to effect service on OJSC within the day time period allowed under the applicable Maryland attachment procedure voiding the attachment The service issue is not as strong as the solvency argument as there is no Maryland law that holds that the failure to serve process within the day period on the defendant in the underlying suit is in fact lethal to an attachment related to that suit Based on the solvency argument Miles and Stockbridge believe that MG Metals has a better than even chance of prevailing on its motion to vacate the escrow account The Courts ruling on the attachment issue is obviously pivotal to us in this matter I will report immediately once the Court rules Parenthetically Mark Gately the Miles Stockbridge partner originally on this file has left that firm for the Baltimore office of Hogan Hartson Martin has asked that the file stay with Miles Stockbridge the partner in charge will now be Tim Mullen and that Mark who signed all the pleadings and attended all the hearings to date as MGs first chair attorney be used as necessary but that we not be charged for two law firms In speaking with Tim Mullin the partner in charge now at Miles Stockbridge I am not sure that he is aware of the last caveat re not being charged for two law firms although he mentioned that he would recommend that Mark be involved for no more than one more hearing after which his presence would not be necessary You should also be aware that Base Metals has filed proceedings to confirm the arbitration award and attach aluminum from OJSC elsewhere in the US The aluminum involved in the other proceedings is not owned by MG Metals According to Martin Base Metals being virtually out of business does not have a lot of money to pursue litigation I would be grateful if Martin andor Arthur would correct me if any of the foregoing is in error With regard to further reporting I understand that I am to keep you Marcus and Martin closely advised I am awaiting confirmation from Arthur that he is agreeable to transitioning out of the file under which circumstances he will not be included in any future reports and Arthur if my

identified the Adkins payment errors Im sorry but I dont have any documented audit findings Any correspondence I did have was l ost in the conversion to Outlook I do still maintain my Supplier Referenc e Book but I dont think it would be much help However I did review the CGAS IF pricing the for the year prior to the deal Only one month during that time was the index price higher than the contracted In fact they were considerably lower Also Ive reviewed the settlement statement s it appears we paid Mr Adkins for three months before the error was caug ht The first month was paid at

writte n legal analysis Adkins does not want to drop the claim Farrell told you and me that he thought the mere sending of your confirm did not overweig h the months that ENA paid Adkins under the index price which established in Farrells view a course of dealing between the parties that made the ind ex price the correct price During this short telephone conference Farrel l never said whether his client had received the confirmation Of course our position is that whether Adkins telefax machine printed out the confir mation is irrelevant we have the evidence necessary to show that we sent i t Farrell told us that he expected to send us a response next week contin uing his demand for arbitration He did not say whether there would be any settlement offer in the letter I will advise you as soon as I receive Fa rrells letter I would be very pleased to arbitrate this for you as your trial counsel I believe that Farrell is correct in stating that there are sufficient fa cts to create a course of performance issue on which arbitrators could rul e in favor of Adkins However I believe that we have a persuasive argumen t that ENA paid the incorrect price only as a result of a clerical error In order to support this argument we also need to develop the following Did Franklin Adkins do or not do anything as the result of receipt o f payment of the index price for a period of time that disadvantaged him The timing of when Adkins first realized he was being paid the index price may be critical I need to speak to the right person about how we would h ave made payment and what business documents were sent to Adkins after the confirm was telefaxed and get copies of all those documents Could someon e tell me who that would be Did ENA correct the price before or after the spot

Steve Knight of Philchem about this Should you and I set up a time to discuss I think we need to go forward with the claim against Underwriters as soon as possible but at the same time I dont recommend a going forward on a thirdparty action against either Baytank or Philchem and b I think we need to dissuade Underwriters from thinking about a subrogation against Baytank or Philchem Let me know when youd like to talk Britt Original Message From Davis Britt Sent Thursday September PM To Sanders Richard B Cc Bahner Rita Zikes Becky Edison Andrew Subject FW In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters Importance High Richard I apologize for not getting back to you more quickly on this frankly I keep hoping I can think of a clear solution to this problematic file but with no success We are coming up on a Texas twoyear tort statute of limitions in November My previous email to you details what a can of worms this matter is for us Since that email I have focused my review on the very troublesome boomerang indemnity aspect of this matterwhether anything we recover from Baytank or Underwriters we might have to turn right around and pay back to Philchem if as is likely Philchem gets sued by Baytank for indemnity and if Philchem then sues us for breach of our marketing agreement with Philchem My conclusion is that we in fact do run a substantial risk of that happening based on my view of Baytanks explicit indemnity rights against Philchem under the Terminalling Agreement between them and the clear intent of the Enron and Philchem in the Marketing Agreement for Philchem not to be liable for anything except pollution liability hazardous waste disposal etc While this intent is not specifically spelled out Janice Moore who wrote EnronPhilchem contract told me this was the only reason for the contract otherwise Enron would have entered into the Terminalling Agreement directly with Baytank and Steve Knight with Philchem never loses the chance to say that Enron and Philchem were partners Philchem was basically acting as the marketing arm of Enron for this product John Nowlan was involved in the drafting of the Marketing Agreement I havent spoken to him about it All this is of course assuming that Baytank couldnt either a get a noduty summary judgment granted against Enron if Enron filed a tort claim against Baytank or b at least have the damage limitation provisions of the terminalling agreement applied to such a tort claim Under b Enron probably couldnt recover more from Baytank than what Enron could get from Underwriters My recommendationgo get as much as we can from Underwriters but do everything we can to dissuade them from pursuing a subrogation action against Philchem and I think there is what amounts to a waiver of subrogation clause there anyway or a subrogation action against Baytank which will undoubtedly trigger an indemnity action against Philchem Of course this will probably limit us to a recovery of about K at best and we have this matter on our books for about K Parenthetically I just got a call from Steve Knight of Philchem a week or so ago Although Philchem has stopped doing business he is keeping a reserve in case we decide to sue him and wants his accountants to be able to let it go We might be able to get a small settlement out of him to add to whatever we get from Underwriters Let me know what you think I havent given this news to Steve Elliott yet Britt PS to Andy I dont know if this is now one of your files so I am reporting to you on it as well Original Message From Davis Britt Sent Friday June PM To Sanders Richard B Cc Bahner Rita Zikes Becky Subject In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters Importance High Richard This is the styrene monomer contamination claim that arose in November of and that involves Philchem and Baytank Steve Elliott is the trader We probably have the claim on our books valued at around It continues to be problematic Heres the big picture for Enron Petrochemicals recovery prospects Underwriters are correctly relying on the declared value provisions of our policy to limit Enrons total recovery to about this is what Underwriters adjuster said she would consider settling for at one time subject to receipt of additional documentation I have also seen subsequent correspondence from her in January of this year where she says that due to prejudice to her third party rights she would only consider settling for about To the extent Underwriters pay they are probably entitled to subrogate and get their money back first Philchems contract with Enron Petrochemicals contains onerous for us limitation of damages clauses I am told that the only reason for the EnronPhilchem contract was to prevent Enron from being in privity with Baytank and potentially having some exposure for spills Otherwise Philchem basically acts as Enrons marketing arm Consequently Philchem was allowed to effectively insulate itself from liability in a situation like this First to the extent Underwriters have paid us we cant recover such payments again from Philchem and neither can Underwriters Second to the extent that Baytank isnt liable to us for damages we have to pay it Last the only liability theory explicitly mentioned by the contract is based on negligence and it would be very difficult for us to prove Philchem was negligent unless that negligence could be imputed from Baytank which I dont think is likely Philchems contract with Baytank also contains onerous for Philchem and us limitation of damages clauses as well That contract explicitly limits Philchems recovery to a causes of action based on negligence for b the lesser of the actual cost of the product to Philchem or a certain dollar amount whichever is less My gut is that these provisions may limit EnronPhilchem to even less than what Enron could recover from Underwriters and of course the Underwriters would get the first anyway Because of these substantial problems I am working on a direct tort action by Enron Petrochemicals against Baytank There are however substantial problems with that approach as well as follows Does Baytank owe Enron Petrochemicals a duty According to Steve Elliott Baytank may not have known it was Enrons product I would need evidence of custom and practice in the industry that Baytank customarily contracts with parties who put product owned by others in Baytanks tanks with same or similar contract language There is also language in the contract that states that as between Philchem and Baytank Philchem retains the title to the property at all times That language probably wasnt meant to apply to this situation but I could see Baytanks lawyers saying it means that Philchem could only put product to which it had title in Baytanks tanks Is Enron bound by the limitations of remedies clauses in the PhilchemBaytank contract under some partnership joint venturer principalagent third part obligor or other theory The EnronPhilchem contract expressly denies that it creates a partnership joint venture or principalagent relationship but I think a Courtjury will really be leaning in Baytanks favor once it becomes aware of the primary reason for the EnronPhilchem contract to insulate Enron from possible liability for a spill while otherwise giving Enron the benefit of the Baytank contract The EnronPhilchem contract in fact attaches a copy of the executed PhilchemBaytank contract Will even an otherwise valid direct tort action against Baytank ultimately boomerang on Enron through the indemnity clauses in both contracts This is huge It makes no sense for Enron to go after Baytank and spend substantial attorneys fees if Enron will ultimately have to pay back any recovery to Philchem It gets worse if you consider Underwriters subrogation rights Supposed Enron gets paid by Underwriters and Enron recovers from Baytank Underwriters keep the Baytank goes after Philchem who goes after us If Im right on the indemnity boomerang Enron would actually pay what it recovered from Underwriters to Philchem If this is correct our best case may be to get our insurance claim paid and discourage Underwriters from going after Baytank I will keep you advised Britt

<11732897.1075853241117.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2000-10-19 09:28:00,In re ICTS Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Nicole and Bob I have had some preliminary legal research done on whether Enron Metals has a prelitigation duty to contest the various allegedly unpaid bills received from the various ICTSrelated carriers in order to preserve its legal defenses if litigation is filed by one or more of those carriers It does appear that in order to preserve its right to contest these bills in a later legal proceeding Enron Metals should send a notice in writing to each of the carriers who have sent it unpaid bills simply stating that Enron Metals contests them This should be done such that the carrier receives the notice of contest within days after MG Metals has received the unpaid bill Telefax appears to be a legally sufficient means of communicating this notice However this is not the end of the strategy consideration It also appears from our preliminary legal research that Enron Metals may in fact be secondarily liable for the unpaid bills even if Enron Metals already paid in full in advance to ICTS its shipping agent This may apply even if ICTS mistakenly failed to request sufficient payment from Enron Metals to begin with ie a situation where ICTS thought it could get a carrier to transport a load for and asked for and received in payment from Enron Metals but had to agree to pay to get the load transported Last I believe Bob mentioned that there are in fact unpaid carriers bills for which Enron Metals has not paid ICTS at all given the realistic fear that once ICTS has Enron Metals money that money may not get repaid to the carrier In other words assuming that the bills are in fact factually accurate were timely billed and were accurately calculated using the applicable tariff rates all of which may be important potential defenses that I have not investigated then Enron Metals may not have any legal defenses and sending the day notice to the carriers may ultimately do nothing to help Enron Metals if the carrier elects to file some legal action Worse if Enron Metals has not already sent out such letters doing so now may attract attention by these carriers who otherwise may have backburnered these claims On the other hand sending such letters may and I repeat may deter some of the carriers if the carriers are aware of substantial problems with their bills I will have my secretary Deborah Shahmoradi call each of you to arrange for a telephone conference for tomorrow or Monday to discuss this Britt PSRichard this is just FYI you dont need to be in on the telephone conference

acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the abovereferenced new matter which concerns a thirdparty attachment of a load of aluminum worth about million and owned by MG Metals I read the file you gave me and have spoken with Arthur Taylor the inhouse attorney for MG USA who was monitoring this file Tim Mullin and Scott Haiber our outside counsel at Miles Stockbridge in Baltimore and Martin Stanley the London trader whose deal this was I will shortly be receiving a complete copy of Miles Stockbridges correspondence and pleading files You have already sent to me various emails in this matter which I understand that Martin had forwarded to you FACTS AND STATUS Briefly stated the significant facts are as follows On June Base Metals obtained an ex parte attachment order from the US District Court for the District of Maryland Northern Division for a cargo of aluminum previously purchased by MG Metals from a third party and being discharged in the Port of Baltimore Base Metals contends that the attachment was required because a the aluminum was actually still owned by OJSC a Russian smelter and the only named defendant in the underlying suit or b that the aluminum had been fraudulently conveyed to MG Metals However MG Metals has never been listed as a defendant in the case The aluminum was in fact attached by Base Metals per the order The underlying lawsuit by Base Metals a trading company against OJSC the Russian smelter seeks to confirm an international arbitration award obtained in Moscow late last year of approximately That arbitration reportedly arose out of the breach by OJSC of a long term output contract between OJSC and Base Metals pursuant to which Base Metals apparently had the right to market most or all the production from OJSC That breach has reportedly put Base Metals virtually out of business OJSC has reportedly very recently been served by Base Metals with the Maryland federal lawsuit but has not appeared On July the Court granted MG Metals emergency motion to allow the sale of the aluminum provided that the sale proceeds were placed into an interest bearing escrow account Reportedly all the previouslyattached aluminum has been sold and approximately million of sales proceeds have been deposited into the escrow account Additional sale proceeds are anticipated to be deposited in the near future with the total running in the range of about million On July MG Metals served a motion to vacate the order establishing the escrow account and a request for an expedited hearing The first reason set forth in the motion is that Base Metals could not prove that OJSC owned the metal given that MG Metals is shown as the shipper on the relevant straight bills of lading has all the necessary purchase and sale documents from an intermediate buyer and has reportedly paid fair market value to that intermediate buyer for the aluminum The second reason is that MG Metals solvency obviates the need for an escrow account Base Metals has filed a response with supporting affidavits contending that the aluminum was fraudulently transferred to MG Metalsand that MG Metals was actually aware of this This awareness allegedly arose at least in part as the result of a warning from a representative of Base Metals to a representative of MG Metals about the takeover of the Russian smelter through a corruption of the Russian bankruptcy process by Russian competitors in the metals business For strategy reasons even though MG Metals advises that this conversation never took place and that all it was aware of were rumours that frequently come out of Russia MG Metals has not chosen to file affidavits controverting its alleged knowledge This is because Base Metals lead law firm in Philadelphia is composed primarily of Russian immigrants and appears to be tied to a law firm located in Russia Clearly Base Metals is better prepared than us to obtain information from Russia For that reason we are trying to keep turning this case into a swearing match about what MG Metals knew was happening in Russia by focusing on other arguments such as the solvency argument Along these lines MG Metals will also shortly file a supplemental pleading arguing that Base Metals failed to effect service on OJSC within the day time period allowed under the applicable Maryland attachment procedure voiding the attachment The service issue is not as strong as the solvency argument as there is no Maryland law that holds that the failure to serve process within the day period on the defendant in the underlying suit is in fact lethal to an attachment related to that suit Based on the solvency argument Miles and Stockbridge believe that MG Metals has a better than even chance of prevailing on its motion to vacate the escrow account The Courts ruling on the attachment issue is obviously pivotal to us in this matter I will report immediately once the Court rules Parenthetically Mark Gately the Miles Stockbridge partner originally on this file has left that firm for the Baltimore office of Hogan Hartson Martin has asked that the file stay with Miles Stockbridge the partner in charge will now be Tim Mullen and that Mark who signed all the pleadings and attended all the hearings to date as MGs first chair attorney be used as necessary but that we not be charged for two law firms In speaking with Tim Mullin the partner in charge now at Miles Stockbridge I am not sure that he is aware of the last caveat re not being charged for two law firms although he mentioned that he would recommend that Mark be involved for no more than one more hearing after which his presence would not be necessary You should also be aware that Base Metals has filed proceedings to confirm the arbitration award and attach aluminum from OJSC elsewhere in the US The aluminum involved in the other proceedings is not owned by MG Metals According to Martin Base Metals being virtually out of business does not have a lot of money to pursue litigation I would be grateful if Martin andor Arthur would correct me if any of the foregoing is in error With regard to further reporting I understand that I am to keep you Marcus and Martin closely

to withdrawdismiss their claims against each other and walk away from this case before year end If you wouldnt mind I would appreciate a short email from you regarding Exmars response during your meeting with them Many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM PM To cc Subject SANTA CLARA Britt I would summarise the main factsstatus of this matter as follows Enron voyage chartered SANTA CLARA from Exmar NV by a CP dated to carry cargo of mt more or less at owners option of propane from Houston to Dunkirk Under the Charterparty Enron had the option to load cargo either fully refrigerated or ambient or chilled On th February the Master advised Enron that the maximum quantity that the cargo could load at ambient temperature was mt having regard to the vessels pressure settings and the USCG and IMO Rules and Regulations The Master was in fact absolutely correct but Exmar tried to make out that the vessel could load the full charterparty quantity It is our case that in order to load more than mt the cargo was loaded at ambient temperature Exmar refrigerated the cargo as it came on board to reduce the volume This caused the loading to be excessively slow We say this method of loading was actually illegal It was only by loading illegally in this way that Exmar could load more than mt at the required pressure setting We also say it was an express term of the charterparty that the entire contractual cargo could be loaded within the contractual lay time The vessel also had to raise the temperature and discharge causing further delays There was great commerical pressure on Enron at the time The market for propane was falling rapidly in March the end of the Northern European winter and Enron had arranged the on sale of a minimum quantity of mt on CIF terms based on an expected loading of stth March Enron were extremely concerned that this would lead purchasers Vitol to repudiate the sale contract leading to a very substantial trading loss Vitol did try to repudiate the sale contract due to the loading delays and this developed into a very major trading dispute with Vitol which we eventually won in the House of Lords Exmar made out that slow loading was due to low back pressure in his Enterprise loading lines We believe this is wrong but at this distance in time it is difficult to get clear evidence In the circumstances on th March to try and speed up loading Enron agreed that the minimum cargo of mt should be loaded and agreed to pay Exmar deadfreight on the balance in the sum of US Furthermore because of the slow loading of the vessel the Enterprise Terminal had to throw SANTA CLARA off berth This would have caused a very substantial delay and might have justified Vitol in throwing over the sales contract In the circumstances Enron negotiated an agreement with another vessel DONAU to permit SANTA CLARA to be loaded ahead of DONAU The sum paid to DONAU amounted to US We believe the DONAU was also operated by Exmar Accordingly Enron deny liability for demurrage for the extended loading which Exmar have claimed in the sum of US and Enron have counterclaimed a total of US ie the deadfreight and DONAU payments Exmar are represented by London Solicitors Lawrence Graham where the matter is being handled by Mike Lax and his assistant Stuart Dench Lawrence Graham have always sought to charactercise this claim as a straightforward demurrage dispute and suggest that we have invented the technical arguments after the event However we consider there is merit in our case and that if the arbitrators properly understand the expert evidence we have reasonable prospects of successfully defending the demurrage claim and establishing the counterclaim There is of course however an inevitable litigation risk in pursuing the matter to an arbitration and we have to some extent been inconvenienced by the loss of our original expert Mr Ivor Jorstad who sadly passed away earlier this year Also some costs will be irrecoverable if we win approximately two thirds of our costs should be recoverable If you have any further queries please do not hesitate to ring me and I would of course be pleased to speak

need to get John Nowlans authority he is the ultimate business client before we send this message to Mitsubishi I am trying to meet with him tomorrow to get that authority Ill keep you closely advised as to my progress BKD Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM PM To cc Subject MV PACIFIC VIRGO Thanks for the detailed information you gave me in our lengthy telephone conversations today and the exchange of views I have not finished reading all the documents yet and set out some preliminary thoughts to cover the areas we discussed Experts I have no problem with Richard Gregory provided he is the one who does the work As for Dr Mullen of Burgoynes I do have some reservations He is principally in my view a fire expert whilst acknowledging he does have chemistry knowledge I wonder if he is the right man for a technical oil chemistry job My preferred choice is Mr Steve Jones of APC Petroleum in the UK I have used him before and found him clever and objective I know that John Minton for whom I have a high regard regards him well Britt has said that it is important we take the right decision here even if it means sending a UK chemist out to Singapore to attend the joint sampling Mr Jones therefore has my recommendation A potential problem is that he is on holiday from today returning to the office on Tuesday morning He is fairly available after then Since it is unlikely that the joint testing will take place this week nor the very early part of next week perhaps this is not a problem I assume the joint testing will be proceeded by agreement between the relevant nominated experts to the test programme Mr Jones if he is appointed can deal with this in the UK by liaising with Mr Bennett of MTD whom he knows and others I wonder if SGS should also be shown a proposed test programme and they should also attend the joint testing My own thinking is that Mr Bennett of MTD should perhaps prepare a test programme but you may have already dealt with this and taken other decisions Claim against time charterers I have looked at the advices Priority should be given to understanding fully the exchanges on the charterers cleaning instructions It may be worthwhile taking a statement from Enrons charterers representation who was responsible for giving the instructions and corresponding with owners It does seem that Enron was annoyed that the vessel did not have sufficient fresh water on board to carry out a water rinse which Enron wanted to order the vessel to carry out It seems that the vessel simply said that this was not an option because they did not have sufficient fresh water on board leaving Enron with no alternative but to load on top with strippingdraining encouraged perhaps by owners comment that the last cargo was Cossack crude and the loading operation was load on top basis ie no tank cleaning was performed prior to loading the cargo I think we need to explore carefully these telex exchanges before coming to a final view on the vessels responsiblity for the contamination assuming it is agreed that the cargo damage is attributable to the vessel and lack of cleaning a point MTD will be closely looking at with respect to the claim under the policy that underwriters anticipate At the moment these telex exchanges look favourable FreightDemurrage A long with others I agree that we should not pay this to time charterers Probably the time has arrived where we should be sending a message along the lines that the freight for the second leg and demurrage has been occasioned solely as a result of time charterers breach of their charter obligation Put simply cargo was delivered to them in a sound condition and discharged in a contaminated condition most probably because the tanks were not fit and suitable for the carriage of the cargo In our message perhaps we can suggest that further discussion on the matter should be put on hold until the outcome of the joint testing and the parties should be guided accordingly by the outcome In the event of any continuing disagreement the dispute will have to be resolved in arbitration Personally I think it may well be difficult to resist an application for an interim award for freight since it will be argued that freight for the second leg was paid on existing charterparty terms that I think provides that payment should be made without discount I think I am right in saying there was no separate charterparty entered into and we will also have to take a closer look at the messages with owners when the second leg was discussed The claim for demurrage will be easier to resist assuming it is attributable to the contamination Any demurrage that is not attributable to the contamination should probably be paid Claim against head owners under BL For reasons discussed we should explore the possibility of an arrest Britt would like WFW to ask Ang Partners if they are conflicted out and also how much it will cost to arrest including how much monies are to be advanced prior to securing an arrest Ang Partners are not to be instructed yet Your contract with FGPC This appears to be unrelated to the contamination in the sense that I note the cargo passed D with ashing methods used and failed on th July both with ashing and plain D methods For reasons probably connected with Siemens FGPC refuse to amend the contract which is obviously the sensible thing to do I assume by the way SGS are right when they say that ashing is a modification of the test method as opposed to a preparatory step or addition ie are SGS right in saying that the test method has not been complied with if ashing is used It may be that the way to look at this is to focus on mitigation It is obvious that Enron are boxed in and cannot find a condensate that using this test method will generate an accurate result It is hit and miss I have nof formed a view on how to proceed yet and am anxious to get this email off to you as it stands Regards DAVID BEST Please

we have an argument but it is too early to tell whether we have the better argument BKD Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM PM To cc Subject mv PACIFIC VIRGO From David Best You asked for a preliminary opinion following our telephone conference this morning on Enrons contractual remedies and exposures on the FGPC contract I am afraid the matter is complex and there is no straightforward answer First we should start with the contract which I have now read I am assuming the NDC date has passed but not the conversion date Article is an acknowledgment by the seller that the buyers preference is for condensate because of favourable tax considerations There is however an unfettered option given by Article to Enron to deliver alternative liquid fuel in the form of gasoil or naphtha meeting the quality specifications The quality specifications for liquid fuel are set out in Appendix A Article under the abbreviation T provides for a liquid fuel tax differential which is a price burden falling on Enron as part of the price formulation However in the event seller is unable to deliver condensate using reasonable commercial efforts but supplies another type of liquid fuel instead T shall be deemed to be zero for the first barrels in the aggregate of such other types of liquid fuel delivered in a contract year Other relevant Articles are buyers right to secure alternative supplies the whole of Article sellers default the whole of Article determination of quantity and quality mitigation of losses and a buyer shall be under no obligation to accept delivery of any quantity of liquid fuel which fails to meet the quality specifications No doubt there are other relevant Articles but the above seem the important ones to me The facts have been summarised already in numerous emails and correspondence and I certainly will not repeat them except to say that I think it is correct that It is simply not possible to buy condensate applying test method D for condensate For this reason for example your contract with Phillips Brothers for the PACIFIC VIRGO did not include this test method SGS consider D is wholly inappropriate for condensate and have said that modifying D with ashing is the preferred method to achieve higher reproduceability Indeed the previous two cargoes of condensate supplied to FGPC have been tested using ashing The gasoil has been nominated for August to replace the contaminated Elang arguably because of the lack of lead time to find suitable cargo of condensate but more probably because the trader in question understandably is concerned that a substitute condensate cargo may fail if the plain D test method is used FGCP have said in a recent email dated th July that FGCP will not hesitate to reject any cargo which fails to meet the guaranteed specification and which offers any possibility of invalidating any guarantees or warranties given by Siemens They are therefore not prepared to entertain any amendment to the contract Following our telephone conference and having read the contract I saw problems for Enron and decided to share my thoughts with John Lockey of Essex Court Chambers He is the barrister specialising in such problems often used by me and the firm for second opinions and obviously helpful on a case such as this We debated the subject at length and came to the following tentative conclusions which I shall put in bullet form He and I are available for discussion at am tomorrow at my office and I propose to call you at that time to hear your comments and to deal with any questions you may have on the following We think that it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts to justify zero tax for the first barrels of other types of liquid fuel in any contract year It seems to us that this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into and is not designed to provide effectively a letout because the contract simply cannot be complied with at all from its start FGPC will simply argue with some prospect of success that they entered into the contract and agreed its terms regarding pricing etc on the basis that Enron was able to supply condensate applying D This squares with what they have said in their recent email which I have quoted above The same email goes on to say The allowance for barrels was built into the LFPC to act as a safety valve only to be used should circumstances demand it If we are right about what we say above this means that Enron are in the invidious position of having to source condensate to avoid the tax not knowing whether it is going to meet D If SGS test using D and fail the cargo the contract supposedly gives FGPC an entitlement to reject Their cover costs could include gasoil with its additional tax as a cost since there is no available condensate for sale on the market applying D assuming we are right about this assumption in above It occurs to us that it may be possible to argue with some merit that Appendix B has to be construed to imply a term that D only applies to condensate if it is truly applicable to that grade You will note that Appendix B sets out a test method in one column and three grades gasoil naphtha and condensate in other columns If SGS are right that the test method is inappropriate they should not be testing against D for condensate Putting it another way the condensate could be on spec applying the appropriate ashing method and the test method set out in Appendix B will not necessarily determine this As you say it is hit and miss Objectively the intention of the parties must be to apply the appropriate test method or not to apply a test method if it is not capable of determining the contractual specification Applying this reasoning it means that Enron are not in breach by supplying a cargo of condensate in circumstances where the D test is simply not carried out because contractually it cannot apply As we say above we think SGS should not be carrying out this test at all if it is entirely inappropriate Indeed SGS who are jointly appointed should be instructed by Enron not to carry out the test There is some force for this in Article a which says that measurement of quantities and taking of samples for the purposes of determining the quality of liquid fuel in each shipment should be carried out in accordance with international standard practice at the time of the shipment in question It is not completely on point since the clause does not deal specifically with testing In the event that SGS confirm it is inappropriate to carry out the test and they simply do not test the buyer will be left without any test certificate that shows the cargo has failed to meet the quality specifications Should subsequently the buyer test on his own under D and it fails whilst SGS independently apply the ashing method and it passes we believe the buyers will be in difficulties in maintaining a lawful rejection Before this angle is pursued we think SGS should be contacted to confirm the test method is inappropriate We also think it is important that you and we have sight of the exact wording of the test method to see whether on its face it is inappropriate for condensate This would help to reinforce the contention that it is inapplicable to condensate in Appendix B Finally I should like to have sight of the Appendix Typical laboratory condensate analyses that is attached to the fuel supply plan that you faxed yesterday We look forward to

David asked to help him given the urgency and complexity of this dispute Deborah please print out and file BKD Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on AM AM To cc Subject mv PACIFIC VIRGO From David Best Following our telephone conference this morning the following advice can be given Please treat this advice as the joint advice of myself and Counsel John Lockey We give it in bullet form for the purposes of clarity The terms of the ASTM D do support the view that it is inappropriate to apply D to condensate The fact remains however that the contract defines the contractual specification by reference to D On the face of it Enron has promised a specification in accordance with test method D and has agreed to assume the risk tht the condensate does not satisfy the specification when tested in accordance with D The terms of Appendix to the Fuel Supply Plan seem to us to make it much more difficult to argue that the reference in Appendix B of the contract fo D means only that D applies to condensate to the extent that it is appropriate to use D for condensate The fact that Enron reported test results for condensate in Appendix to the Fuel Supply Plan by reference simply to test method D makes it very difficult to argue that when the parties concluded the contract they would have had in mind that D applies only to gasoil and would not apply or would only apply with modifications to condensate The terms of the Fuel Supply Planand of Appendix make it even more difficult to argue that the impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts Even though Enron is not contractually committed to the terms of the Fuel Supply Contract the fact is that Enron put forward typical specifications for condensate by reference to D The Fuel Supply Plan reemphasises the importance to the buyer of being provided with condensate in preference to naptha or gasoil Our understanding of SGS advice to Enron is that D does not envisage ashing and that it would be wrong to report a result by reference to test method D if the sample had been ashed before testing Should SGS provide a test certificate certifying a specification which is outside contractual specification applying Dwith a notation that condensate falls outside the scope of D as they suggest the buyers will still be able to reject because any verification is final conclusive and binding on the parties provided there is no manifest error If it is the case that applying D without any modifications to the ASTM methodology to portions of the sample condensate provided to the independent inspector would or may well produce different results in ppm for the same sample because of the volatility of condensate it seems to us to be strongly arguable that the independent inspector aware that his certification of noncompliance will be binding under the contract should simply refuse to certify a test result by reference to D It seems to us to be difficult in those circumstances for the inspector to conclude that a particular test result is reliable Furthermore if it is the case that it is not practically possible to certify quantities of elements below ppm using D on condensate then again the independent inspector should refuse to certify at those levels If the independent inspector refuses to certify by reference to D the buyer will have to decide whether to reject and take his chances of demonstrating that in fact the condensate was offspec by reference to D The absence of a certificate of compliance with specification does not seem to us to justify rejection If the buyer decides to reject an arbitrator would have to decide on all the evidence whether the cargo was offspec as measured by D The buyer would be running the risk that he could not justify the rejection with a potential exposure to Enrons costs It would be prudent in those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using D methodology in order to present an average and hopefully onspec result to counteract the test results produced by the buyer It would also be prudent in those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using SGS preferred method of testing condensate as these results could be used by Enron to require the buyer to take a rejected cargo in mitigation of the buyers loss or to submit to the arbitrators that the buyer should have mitigated by accepting retender of the rejected cargo when accompanied by an independent inspectors certification that the specs were met by reference to the much more appropriate methods for testing Contractually it is almost certainly not open to Enron to refuse to agree on the appointment of an independent inspector or to insist that the independent inspector should not test the sample of condensate using method D unless there are modifications to that method when applied to condensate However there does not appear to be any objection to Enron advising in advance that because the independent inspectors certificate is intended to be binding under the contract the independent inspector should not provide a result by reference to D unless satisfied that that result is truly representative of the qualities of the sample Turning to Enrons exposure to a tax liability on the nomination and shipment of gasoil we repeat our advice given in our e mail of nd August that it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts to justify zero tax It seems to us that this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into The onus is on Enron to demonstrate that it has used reasonable commercial efforts It is likely in our view that FGCP will set off against price a sum equivalent to the tax liability so that Enron is out of pocket with the regard to the nominated gasoil Unless Enron wishes to manage the contract by risking a rejection dispute each time condensate is delivered assuming SGS do not certify Enron may want try to renegotiate the contract It may be that the point we have raised in concerning the risk of an unlawful rejection by the buyer may be helpful in any such renegotiation Regards David Best PLEASE REPLY TO This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for

<6127116.1075853247526.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2000-08-10 09:28:00,Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Im on the same page as Janice with regard to testing although Id like to spin out my thoughts a bit In my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both D with ashing and D without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis Mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons Prior to the joint analysis Mitsubishi will be aware that a D without ashing is in the FGH contract and that b ECT believes D without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product Given this if ECT proposes to use only D with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D without ashing The same would apply I think if even if ECT proposed to use only D without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis The more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec Mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT to credibly take the position that only one test or the other D with ashing or D without ashing should be run in fact in light of what I believe is virtually inevitable Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to Mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi and not the other way around Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in Singapore I know that we nominated SGS Singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using SGSs lab As Janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with D with and without ashing Also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of the presale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo This latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with SGS about any of this I would suggest that you first confer with David or Neal Many thanks for your help Britt Again many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM Janice R CT AM To Britt NRON cc Alan CT Deborah nron Harry M CT Matthias CT Michael A CT Richard B CT Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt I agree w Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same method used at loadport regardless of whether ashing is proper or not Not for the reason you mention Mitsubishi may well argue about proper rejection but thats not likely a viable argument since the fact is that First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds for that rejection but for the sake of consistency It doesnt matter at all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo its no longer any of their concern Its Enrons risk and sole responsibility to deal w costs following rejection per the contract I hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or will happen on

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have his input for the contamination issue Your views and guidance would be most appreciated Thanks and regards Matt I also note Janices preference to source for US experts to assist us on the D issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able to for

Matt if any of this appears inaccurate to you dont hesitate to point it out The pending joint survey a The joint survey has yet to be scheduled The reason for the delay is an issue concerning whether SGSs Singapore laboratory has the resourcescompetence to carry out the joint analysis Steve Jones ECTs choice of chemist is communicating with SGS in order to make this determination Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing Jones feels strongly that it will be most costeffective for ECT to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination I and Matt have personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT is looking for the quickest most costeffective resolution to this dispute with Mitsubishi Because of the issue with SGS Jones has waited until now to send the proposed testing program to Technichem Mitsubishis choice of surveyorchemist in a previous report I mentioned that the testing program had already been sent to Technichem this now turns out not to be the case By today Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem in order to get the ball rolling and with the expectation that Technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate b If things go well with SGS Jones anticipates scheduling a joint analysis about twothree weeks from now Jones plan to personally attend the joint survey on our behalf given the complexity of the testing methods Even after that testing Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessels inert gas system Costs a Surveyorschemists Jones advises that to date he and his firm have spent a total of about days at pounds per day for a total of approximately pounds or roughly at the current USDpounds exchange rate of pound Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard now with ITSCaleb Brett who specializes in the type of testing at issue Jones estimates that Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter at a daily rate of lbs or Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey begins he will spend about two more days and Goddard will spend about another onehalf day This totals about pounds or For the actual joint testing Jones estimates that he will spend about twelve days straight including transit time Goddard would not attend but would be available by telephone if Jones had a question Twelve days time amounts to pounds or not including aire fare room and board Afterwards for the additional testing in England to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt Jones estimates another pounds for the cost of the lab he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure which he believes could be completed in about two days If he attended both days this additional testing in England would run to another pounds or b Other experts SGS and Caleb Bretts costs to date are being compiled by Matt SGS will spend another SGD purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing and bill for another SGD for prejointanalysis development work basically practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO This comes to a total of SGD or about to prepare for the joint analysis based on the current reported SGDUSD exchange rate of SGS estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD or about Captain Sawant of PacMarine one of our ship operations experts will be charging us SGD or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report Captain Gregory of Noble Denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time c Attorneys David Best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about This is subject to being adjusted up or down once Best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill I imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on the FGH issue Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing Neale Gregsons firm Watson Farley has incurred fees and expense to date of SGD or about Matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter Matt will be asking Gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter My and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately This also includes time spent on the FGH matter although pursuant to Alans instructions I am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised d Summary of Costs In sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date and once David Best comes back from vacation on September and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the FGH matter Another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in Singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in London after the joint analysis is done if Steve Jones determines that such further testing is necessary Recent Sale of Thailand cargo a You will recall that the bulk of the product from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to FGH given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines which was tendered to FGH who rejected it Samples from the shore tanks in Thailand have recently been tested by SGSs laboratory in the US and reportedly found on spec All of the Thailand product has recently been sold to Caltex Singapore for delivery September reportedly for use in Caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by Caltex very low b Unfortunately Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index Lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the Elang crude ECT has sustained until then We were previously told that the product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about For my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand I am using the working hypothesis that ECTs total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO is in the range of Again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate Expert witness supplemental opinion At my request Captain Sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ECTs instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water Captain Sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred While we can protect Captain Sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue Despite this however ECT still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi

<30591681.1075853247885.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2000-11-07 23:58:00,In re MV PACIFIC VIRGO Cc I have spoken with David Best about the difficulty Paul Henking has encountered so far with getting any agreement from Mitsubishi to delay both the joint surveytesting and arbitration in hopes of a settlement As I understand Pauls suggestion Paul wants to switch fronts and press our cargo underwriters to pay us off and handle the arbitration themselves Paul if I have misstated your strategy please let me know I understand from Pauls email that he does not think Mitsubishi will settle prior to arbitration and joint testing Unfortunately while we want to consider all options neither David nor I think that this approach will succeed We believe that our cargo underwriters response to our claim will be that they too want us to proceed with the joint testing before they will consider paying anything on this claim We should also all recall that ECT performed a presale survey of product from the same location that was offspec Although we do not think that either Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are yet aware of that survey such a survey would seem to raise an inherent vice issue in both proceedings Last until at least the joint testing has been done I think that the cargo underwriters would require us to act as a prudent uninsured ie to name an arbitrator and vigorously litigate our claims Of particular note Steve Jones our expert chemist has notified us that the samples taken for joint testing have a shelflife that may be coming to an end in the near future If the samples begin to turn before the joint testing has taken place the delay of the testing could be used against us in the arbitration Parenthetically it also appears that a representative of the shipowners PI club wants to be involved in the testing It may be that Mitsubishi as the vessels charterer has placed the head owner on notice of our claim against Mitsubishi and of Mitsubishis potential claim for indemnification against the head owner Under the circumstances David and I agree that we should get the joint testing scheduled and done as soon as possible David and I have also spoken about Pauls idea of advancing payment to Mitsubishi for the freight claim of and agreeing to revert to Mitsubishi regarding the demurrage claim by the end of November I assume that Paul means that we would in fact pay what we believe we owed on the demurrage claim at or near that time and that all these amounts would be paid on a without prejudice basis ie that ECT could later pursue recovery of those amounts in arbitration against Mitsubishi The obvious downside of payment is that we lose our best potential leverage for bringing Mitsubishi to the bargaining table but Mitsubishi has resisted that leverage so far We are very exposed to advance payment of freight and demurrage subject to our later right of counterclaim if we can successfully assert that the ship was at fault By paying now we can avoid the attorneys fees and hopefully some or all of the interest that would go with an interim award to Mitsubishi I have not been advised of any anticipated problem with getting Mitsubishi to fund a substantial arbitration award should ECT be successful in proving its contamination claim and recouping the freight and demurrage paid Under these difficult circumstances both David and I agree with Pauls suggestion that we pay the freight and demurrage up front without prejudice but only after we have informally discussed this on a solictortosolicitor basis so that there is no misunderstanding of ECTs intent to pursue the contamination claim and after a tribunal has been agreed to and any other concessions extracted that we can think of This will prevent Mitsubishi from dragging its feet after we make this payment David and I have spoken about the choice of arbitrators for this singlearbitrator proceeding He and Neale agree that using a QC would give us the best shot at a wellthoughtthrough legal opinion and here our best argument may be simply to argue that Mitsubishi has not borne its legal burden to provide a cargoworthy ship Based on David and Neales suggestion I have asked David to approach Mitsubishis solicitors on an informal basis to discuss three QCs that David and Neale find acceptable and determine whether Mitsubishis solicitors also find them acceptable Once that occurs I will revert back to each of you with a recommendation of a single arbitrator That should hopefully occur today or tomorrow I will continue to keep you advised Britt

<22411104.1075853247987.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,britt.davis@enron.com,2001-01-23 05:09:00,Re PACIFIC VIRGO Cc FYI Per my voicemail of a moment ago while I appreciate Matt having raised the possibility of ECT making a bad situation worse by finding a bug I am not inclined to stop the testing I agree with David Bests sense that if there is a bug in the product at the time it was loaded from the suppliers mooring facility and if Mitsubishi or an enduser comes after ECT with a claim that eg the bug contaminated the ships later cargoes the presence of bug in the product would seem to give us a pretty good argument against the supplier in this case a Phillips entity Please also keep in mind that our testing is not just for a bug but also to see whether the possibility of the aging of the cargo may have caused the loadport samples to fail If we stop the testing now our chances of recovering any settlement from Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are remote In fact Jim Studdert just advised that he spoke with the local adjuster for our cargo underwritersand was told I dont think it was an insurable claim if it was contaminated when it was loaded aboard the ship This statement was not a surprise to Jim or me By copy of this I wonder if Mike could send to me a copy of the general terms and conditions that David Best references below Britt PM To cc Subject PACIFIC VIRGO We are into the third day of testing in a series of analytical tests that will be complete on Friday with full results available by the middle of next week It is not possible at this stage to point a finger at anyone since testing is only midway Matt Lee has raised a concern about carrying on testing particularly biological testing to be undertaken on Friday if it is only going to expose Enron further without any recourse against the suppliers Were the testing to stop now we will have incomplete analyses with two sets of loadport data that are in conflict This will make the chances of a recovery against ship and suppliers very difficult in my view Jim Studdert has offered the opinion that it would be very difficult to make a recovery from underwriters with the results as they are at present Steve Jones inclination is to carry on to try and get a firmer view It may be that the ship is still the villain of the piece because even the loadport results that have just come out do not match the kind of filterable dirt that is present in the discharge samples ie there is an increase Biological contamination if present could also mean involvement of the ship particularly if the loadport results are clean or not nearly as bad as the discharge port results On the other hand if biological contamination is shown to be present in the loadport samples at the same kind of level as the discharge port samples clearly the finger points straight at the suppliers and not at underwriters and at the ship I think the suppliers will have a case to answer bearing in mind they contracted to sell Elang blend ultralight crude oil of normal export quality at time and place of loading I will be surprised if normal export quality means that the cargo can carry bugs Can someone fax to me the Enron General Terms Conditions applicable to crude oil petroleum and petrochemical transactions effective st January which are incorporated in the Phillips Petroleum Contract with Enron Capital Trade Resources Singapore I should like to take a look at them Were we to break now midway through the anlaysis I am sure underwriters expert would immediately talk to his principals who will ask the obvious question why we stopped To this extent I think we shall have to carry on to try to get nearer to the truth or something that approaches it If anybody has different views and wants to stop right now will they please let me know immediately Regards David Best This email and any attachments are confidential and may also be privileged If you are not the named recipient please notify the sender immediately and do not disclose the contents to any other person use it for any purpose or store or copy the information In the event of any technical difficulty with this email please contact the sender or the London IT Department on Clyde Co Eastcheap London ECM JP Tel Fax Clyde Co Guildford Beaufort House Chertsey Street Guildford GU HA Tel Fax EMail Internet

will confirm that you have been retained on behalf of Enron Capital Trade Singapore Pte Ltd ECT in the abovereferenced alleged cargo contamination matter as its London solicitor Again you will be liaising with Neale Gregson of Watson Farleys office in Singapore who will continue to perform the factual development on this case for ECT subject to your direction and supervision Matt Lee ECTs inhouse attorney in Singapore will set up a telephone conference with you and Neale for some time tomorrow prior to opening of business in Houston In case you need to get in touch with him the telephone number I use for Matt is I believe Neals number is I will call you tomorrow at pm London time am Houston time to touch base with you FACTS The following is a thumbnail of the facts that have been reported to me I have not had a chance to run this summary past Matt and would be grateful for any corrections he might like to make ECT purchased a quantity of Elang Crude suitable for export from Phillips Petroleum Company Phillips and voyagechartered the MV PACIFIC VIRGO from Mitsubishi Corporation Mitsubishithe timecharterer to carry it from Phillips offshore loading facility in Indonesia to Thailand and the Phillipines for use by the buyer First Gas Power Corporation FGPC as compressor fuel There exists a longterm compressor fuel agreement between ECT and FGPC that contains several specifications that the product needed to pass The agreement between ECT and Phillips does not mention any of these specifications One of the specifications at issue from the ECTFGPC agreement is ASTM D which is used to test for the presence of certain metals According to ECTs surveyors ASTM D apparently does not produce test results that are sufficiently reproducible to be useful ECT has apparently been trying for some months to convince FGPC of this but without success FGPC reportedly advises that Seimens from whom it purchased the compressors at issue might void its warranty to FGPC if fuel is used that does not meet ASTM D A separate specification from the ECTFGPC agreement for sediments may also become at issue Months before the product at issue was loaded ECT had Elang Crude from this same facility tested to determine whether it would meet the FGPC specifications and found that the Elang Crude was onspec for ASTM D but offspec for sedimentation again a test separate and apart from ASTM D by almost double the allowed amount It is not clear why ECT decided to purchase product from Phillips despite this test It is unknown at this time whether this test included any of the product later loaded At some point prior to loading ECT did put the ship on notice that the cargo had to meet specifications for use as compressor fuel The ship responded by recommending that the tanks be Butterworthed at an extra cost per the CP to ECT of ECT declined apparently opting for a less expensive fresh water rinse Reportedly the ship then advised that it did not have sufficient fresh water to perform a fresh water as opposed to seawater rinse I am not sure what tank cleaning ultimately took place or who paid for it SGS ECTs surveyors did deliver a dry certificate to us before loading The ship loaded bbls per BL at the MODEC Venture Phillips floating offshore facility in Indonesia from June Testing of the shore tanks at loading revealed that the Elang Crude did meet the specifications in the FGPC contract ECT paid Phillips an FOB price of for the cargo After loading in Indonesia the ship then proceeded to Thailand where from June it offloaded bbls for storage for the eventual use of FGPC No quality testing of the product was apparently done aboard or ashore at that time The ship thereafter sailed to the Phillipines for offloading the remainder of the cargo Upon offloading in the Phillipines the cargo was found offspec for the presence of metals and sediment FGPC rejected the cargo Wilson Farley opined that FGPC was squarely within its contractual rights to do so ECT placed all potentially liable parties on notice and resold the cargo remaining on board to LG Caltex Caltex reportedly a Korean refinery on a CIF outturn basis for what I understand to be only a small approximately reduction in the value of the cargo ECT will not know exactly what it will be paid by the Korean refinery until the end of August as the purchase was based on an August price index That cargo discharged in Korea and received by Caltex directly into its crude oil storage facility on July It appears that Caltex did not do any quality inspection before this occurred No protest or objection to the quality of the cargo has been received from Caltex ECT is attempting to find another buyer for the Elang Crude currently in storage in Thailand as it is apparently unsuitable for FGPCs use there as well Matt will know whether that product has been tendered to and rejected by FGPC Mitsubishi has tendered an invoice for approximately freight for the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea and has submitted an invoice for approximately for demurrage for the voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines ECT has already paid approximately freight for the voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines Parenthetically two different charter parties were used one for the voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines and one for the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea A number of samples of the cargo were taken at the MODEC Venture in Thailand and the Phillipines at surveys that appear to have been jointly attended by ECT ECTs cargo underwriters and OwnersPI As I understand it the reports of the various analyses done to date are somewhat confusing A joint analysis is being planned to take place in Singapore Unfortunately the seals on a number of samples were broken by SGS our surveyors however my hope is that there are a number of other samples that can serve the same purpose ECT has also retained a Captain Sawant of PacMarine to act as an independent expert for us in this matter Captain Sawant has prepared a report and there is a Watson Farley memo containing notes of an interview of him As I understand his report Captain Sawant believes that the contamination probably took place aboard ship as a result of a inadequate cleaning of the tanks and b the cleansing properties of this condensate cargo A related issue of great importance to ECT is FGPCs position going forward regarding what I understand to be a longterm compressor fuel purchase agreement Under the agreement there are reportedly three alternative fuels which ECT may given certain conditions deliver to FGPC condensate gasoil and naptha Condensate is apparently the first choice but must meet ASTM D which ECT now feels is extremely difficult to do given the unreliability of the test Gasoil can reportedly only be used where ECT has been unable despite the use of due diligence to locate condensate that meets ASTM D If FGPC accepts gasoil as a substitute however then FGPC is responsible for paying a substantial tax on it that does not apply to condensate Naptha will reportedly cause ECT to lose money because of its lower Btu content Because of the problems with the MV PACIFIC VIRGO product ECT has reportedly contacted FGPC about accepting gasoil as a substitute I have heard that this will cause FGPC to become liable for a tax in the range of although this has not been confirmed Before agreeing to accept gasoil FGPC has requested a letter advising what due diligence efforts ECT has performed in order to secure product that does meet its specs Parenthetically I ask that Matt remind me who the ECT trader was who actually did this deal URGENT ISSUES Who to use as ECTs experts Neale has recommended Captain Richard Gregory of Noble Denton and Dr Eric Mullen of Burgoynes I do not know whether Neale intends to use Captain Sawant who has reportedly never testified I feel that the quality of ECTs experts will be of great significance in this case and want to make sure that whoever we use can in your opinion command the respect of a London arbitration tribunal in a proceeding against the ship or if necessary against the cargo underwriters If that means getting a Londonbased expert lets discuss it and get this issue resolved before the joint survey that is being scheduled to take place in the Phillipines Resolving ECTs insurance claim As you know Cliff Bennett of Mintons the same firm that Enron is using as its experts in the MV HAVMANN matter is following this matter for ECTs cargo underwriters I am told that Bennett has not been told by us about the presale product sampling My concern is that once he finds out he and the ship will raise inherent vice as a defense Please take a look at the cargo policy that I will be sending you by courier and a advise of any coverage issues you see and b give us your thoughts as to the best way of resolving ECTs claim quickly Whether ECT should file for arbitration before the ship does so You mentioned that the ship is likely to file an arbitration demand in the near future and seek an interim award of its freight claim Given that I would like your recommendation in very short order as to whether ECT should wait for that to happen and file a counterclaim or proceed with filing an original demand Whether ECT can raise the doctrines of impossibility of performance or frustration of performance or some other legal theory to challenge the use by FGPC of the ASTM D specification in this matter ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION This afternoon I will be faxing certain key documents to you and will send the rest by courier I am also asking that Matt telefax to you copies of the following documents Matt I apologize if you have already sent them to me ECTs purchase agreement with Phillips ECTs longterm agreement to supply fuel to FGPC and purchase orders or the like that particularly relate to this cargo A copy of the first charter party as soon as it is sent to us Anything which reflects the terms of the second charter party David we appreciate your availability and look forward to working with you Regards Britt Davis

PRODUCT Matt Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best given that we already put underwriters on notice that there was contamination and given that we have worked closely with Mintons underwriters representatives I would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place in fact it looks like the final determination of ECTs total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey although I would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum The policy specifically requires under INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS that ECT file a claim in writing against the delivering carrier holding him responsible as soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is not apparent details can be furnished later Such action will not prejudice your insurance claim Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent policy I have already sent a copy to David I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the

Regards Matt Matthias Lee PM To Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Matthias CT Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing PRIVILEGED CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT FYI Please see below Cliff Bennetts recommendations for joint testing I spoke briefly with Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in Thailand He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some time end Augustearly September premised on delivery and acceptance of the first Elang cargo and subject to First Gass consumption Cargo still not sold Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price but will be giving it somethought to arrive at an estimate The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec but principal reason for not delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D as a test method Summary of Thailand samples test results July Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue and Filterable Dirt Filterable Dirt was off spec at Carbon Residue was off spec at SGS Thailand suggested that the Carbon Residue result was questionable and recommended retesting There were however no other ship composite samples taken before discharge in Thailand Shoretank samples tested by

To Matthias Lee cc Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Matthias As per my email dd rd August to Eric from cargo Interests viewpoint it is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options open as possible Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of establishing the cause To that end I would recommend that you provide the other Parties with the test methods ASTM Dnumbers and state that these tests will be applied to retain samples from each of Pacific Virgo before after loading Australia all cargo Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Batangasnominated tanks if samples available Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Thainominated tanks Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas the samples upon which First Gas based their rejection Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas including bottom samples Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea including bottom samples Pacific Virgo any other samples that are available and that might progress the investigation Some testing may involve composites some individual samples This will to a degree depend on the labs ability to get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite If that cant be done it will have to be individuals Insofar as identifying the particulates should this prove necessary I think we need to keep all options open While it is always possible to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise better to keep the Parties together if possible But not at the expense of limiting the analysis ability to determine cause I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly But if you limit at the beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary it can all prove meaningless I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this It is in noones interest to do testing just for the sake of it and as far as I am concerned that is not on my agenda nor I am sure is it on Enrons But we must be realistic Depending upon the size of your potential claim have Underwriters been put on notice yet by the way it might be worth spending several K to get to the root of the matter rather than less to learn nothing Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd Original Message From Matthias Lee To Cc Eric Tan Angeline Poon Date Monday August PM Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Dear Cliff Would you be able to draw up a test programme based on your recommendations below with the view to circulate it to all parties including SGS for their agreement prior to joint testing I think such a preagreed programme would be most useful and would avoid any dispute on testing procedure subsequently Eric expects all the samples to arrive in Singapore within the next couple of days and send out the notice to all parties to attend joint testing sometime between August Thanks and best regards Matt Lee Forwarded by Eric TanSINECT on clifford bennett on To Eric Tan cc Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Eric My recommendations concerning joint testing are as follows Samples Ideally at least one set of sealed integrity traceable chain of custody samples from each stage of the shipment should be available at the joint testing The samples will be checked against the appropriate sampling records prior to testing If possible I think we should have samples from Loading Australia one set Pacific Virgos tanks after loading Discharge Thailand one set predischarge vessels tanks Thai parcel if the other Batangas tanks were sampled at this time these samples should be included Batangas one set vessels tanks on arrival plus one set vessels tanks from the most recent sampling before the vessel departed Batangas to include dead bottom samples Korea one set predischarge vessels tanks on arrival including any dead bottom samples Depending on exactly what samples are available testing may encompass both composites and in some cases individual tank samples where particulates are involved the composition of individual tank samples even in a laboratory can destroy the representivity of a sample This by the way is the reason for my concerns over sample decanting in Philippines evidence can be lost Testing I would suggest the laboratory of SGS Singapore because that is where the samples are being collated Provided the testing can be done to the appropriate standard and the methods are available any laboratory would do As advised previously the laboratory tests and the witnesses are there to ensure among other things that all is above board Test schedule As advised previously the basic methods I would recommend are Carbon residue ASTM D Carbon residue bottoms ASTM D Ash ASTM D BSW ASTM D V Na K Ca Pb ASTM D Filterable dirt ASTM D Please note that for filterable dirt ASTM D is not applicable as it is designed for insitu line samples ASTM D is a laboratory method that is essentially equivalent Both methods are intended for particulates in aviation fuels Anyway SGS Singapore can run ASTM D The above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples it will almost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples in duplicate Duplicates are necessary because standalone results are always open to doubt In any event duplicates are often a requirement of the test method and any reputable laboratory will run duplicates as a matter of course Duplicate samples should not mean twice the price Investigative testing This is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will be necessary To a degree it will be guided by what is found in the above spec testing My initial recommendation would be to check the solubility of the particulates particularly in aromatic solvent to check if organic and possibly in acid to check if inorganic If as has so far been reported the particulates are not aromatic solvent soluble and because they do not appear to contribute to the ash content of the fuel a best guess might be that they are carbon particles However we need to keep an open mind on this We might need to think about microscopy visible or electron on the particles Possibly also look at elemental analysis of the particles by eg energy dispersive Xray analysis I will give some further thought to what might be required by way of investigative analysis and revert At this stage I suggest that all options on the investigative side are kept open OwnersPI might not agree but realistically we cannot predict what we will find or what might need to be done until we start getting some spec test results and some simple particle solubilities done I trust this helps Please keep me advised regarding samplesjoint test matters Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd
