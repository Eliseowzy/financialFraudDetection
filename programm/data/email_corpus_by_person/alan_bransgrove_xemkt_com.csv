<7495223.1075858584915.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.bransgrove@xemkt.com,2001-08-21 08:27:40,Enfolio confirms sent for PSCo and CLFP Cc NonPrivilegedpst Gerald This will confirm our telephone conversation of todays date As I explained by phone we are trying to obtain consistency of our Gas Supply Agreements between the various operating subsidiaries of Xcel Energy Inc including Cheyenne Light Fuel Power and Public Service Company of Colorado Currently a GISB Style Agreement is in place between Enron companies and each of the Northern States Power companies MN and WI Enron has also executed a Spot Gas Purchase Agreement with Southwestern Public Service Company another operating subsidiary Each of these agreements contain more detailed provisions to describe the agreement of the parties than the Enfolio Firm General Terms and Conditions furnished for our review In particular our concerns with the Enfolio General Terms and Conditions GTC include but are not limited to the following Unlike the GISB style Agreement the GTC contains no provisions to deal with the possibility that a price will not be published for a particular geographic location on any given day except with respect to Default situations under paragraph The GISB Agreement addresses that possibility by incorporating the idea of using an average of previous daynext succeeding day publication pricing in the event no published price is available for the relevant gas day The GTC includes netting of payments due from one party to another That is problematic for us from a regulatory perspective as payment streams for purchases made by the utility are passed through without markup to our ratepayers while accounting methods for any sales of gas by the utility receive different treatment Neither the NSP GISBs nor the SPS Spot Gas Purchase Agreement referred to above contain such netting provisions The Force Majeure provisions under the GTC are not nearly as detailed as those in our existing NSP and SPS agreements The GTC has no written provisions for audit rights It appear to me that the only contractual methodology for obtaining this information would be through discovery in arbitration proceedings In contrast our agreements with Enron for the other operating utilities have written audit provisions included therein There are certain other provisions which we need to include in our agreement ie firm transactions as opposed to interruptible delivery compliance with affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions disclosure to regulatory bodies of contractual provisions with request for protective order regarding pricing etc With the exception of firmness of the transactions the GTC does not seem as amenable to modification through the inclusion of Special Provisions or amendments as does the GISB to address these concerns We understand that GISB as originally crafted does not deal with transactions of longer than one month however we believe the inclusion of Special Provisions to negate that language together with the inclusion of Early Termination type provisions to address Enrons concerns upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event would meet Enrons needs Alternatively we are willing to consider any alternative language that you may propose keeping in mind our desire to move toward more consistency of the agreements between our various operating companies Please let me have your thoughts We would like to get signed agreements in place prior to commencement of the Delivery Period As always I look forward to working with you to achieve that result Sincerely Alan Bransgrove Manager Contract Administration Gas Acquisition Trading Original Message From Nemec Gerald SMTPGerald NRONcom Sent Monday August PM To Cc Whitt Mark Perlingiere Debra Subject FW Enron GISB sent Re Northern States Power Minnesota Enf olio confirms sent for PSCo and CLFP Alan With respect to the Transactions for Cheyenne and Public Service Company Enron prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals These two transactions are month firm deals The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than month in term There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and Enron requires this language for any firm deal Enrons general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than month I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience I can be reached at Original Message From Perlingiere Debra Sent Friday August PM To Nemec Gerald Subject FW Enron GISB sent Re Northern States Power

Debra Subject Enron GISB sent Re Northern States Power Minnesota Enf olio confirms sent for PSCo and CLFP Debra I started to review the abovereferenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on April and realized that we already have a GISB in place between NSPMN and Enron Capital Trade Resources Is it necessary to prepare another GISB with the Enron North America entity or can there be an assignment of the Enron Capital Trade Resources Agmt Please advise In addition I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power which utilized the Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement Our preference would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with each of these utilities Please advise if this is acceptable and if so I will prepare GISB Agreements along with our Special Provisions page and send them to you for review I look forward to your reply Alan Bransgrove Manager Contract Administration Gas Acquisition Trading ps I will be out of the office during the week of August th but will check my voice mail periodically

get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the abovereferenced Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado PSCo and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power CLFP I apologize for the delay Our comments are as follows Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues We request in Section that the dollar level be applicable to each of our companies We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section be as to each of our companies Confirmations In the second line please change may to shall We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section Transactions Netting and Offset We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo or CLFP acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement Early Termination I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two nor more than ten Business Days following the date of such notice Triggering Event In the th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence Please delete this phrase in the Agreement and References to Affiliates In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections and reference is made to Affiliates For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies Moreover neither PSCo nor CLFP is authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLFP in the respective Agreements Article Force Majeure The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section Notices Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section Transfer We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section Limitation of Remedies We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a day confirm deadline rather than hours as reflected in your definition We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured longterm senior debt of such Party or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB or its equivalent by Standard Poors or below Baa or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have any unsecured longterm senior debt that is rate by either Standard Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a or day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated above regarding the PSCo Agreement with the following exceptions Section Triggering Event The dollar levels near the end of the Section should be equivalent between our companies Please make each Section Collateral Requirement Similarly the dollar trigger levels in this provision should be equivalent between our companies Please make each Except for the foregoing please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return email or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration I look forward to working with you to finalize these
