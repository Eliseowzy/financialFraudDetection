Political Economy Center for Strategic and International Studies p f ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY October Number TELLING IT LIKE IT IS Sidney Weintraub This is my curmudgeon commentary Its barbs are directed against exaggeration double talk and scapegoating of important institutions engaged in global economic development I do not intend in what follows to disparage the importance of labor unions in protecting the rights and benefits of workers or to argue that the United States is a protectionist nation or to doubt the valuable work that is done by multilateral institutions My purpose rather is to highlight a few points the hypocrisy that exists when imports of goods and services from poor countries are restricted while simultaneously insisting that this exclusion will benefit workers in those countries the inconsistency of promoting democracy in developing countries even as we neglect the interplay of foreign trade economic wellbeing and political outcomes the perpetuation of the fiction that multilateral institutions are independent actors that behave supranationally in ways that conflict with the desires of their powerful members and the misconception that institutions such as the World Bank provide a service by promising more than they can deliver The leaders of organized labor in the United States opposed NAFTA and the grant of permanent normal trading relations with China They are also against a free trade area of the Americas and opening a new round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization The stated basis for this opposition is that the United States should not further liberalize its import structure until other countries accept core labor standards right of association power to organize and bargain collectively prohibition against forced labor minimum age for employment of children and acceptable working conditions and that punishment should be meted out in the form of US import restrictions when these standards are violated Is this protectionism or a socially conscious initiative to upgrade labor conditions in poor countries The leaders of poor countries insist that they too want to raise labor standards but cannot do this if their export earnings are restricted The practical result of the US position is that meaningful trade negotiations are not going forward Even though labor leaders insist this is not about protectionism it sure looks like protectionism Former senator Dale Bumpers has noted that when politicians say something is not about money it is about money World Bank analysis has shown persuasively that the developing countries that have made the most progress in raising incomes are those that have opened their markets and engaged actively in world trade However there are still antitrade advocates who advise todays developing countries to look inward just as many of todays developed countries focused first on internal markets and protecting their producers against foreign competitors This was Alexander Hamiltons advice to the newborn United States It was the development pattern for Japan It was Ral Prebischs advice to Latin American countries Although this advice may have had some relevance once upon a time for countries with large or potentially large internal markets such as Brazil it surely does not for countries with tiny markets like many in Latin America the Caribbean and Africa The lesson of postWorld War II development history is that countries that looked outward such as those in East Asia grew rapidly while those that looked inward as in Latin America were relatively stagnant Is the advice to poor countries to look inward in the modern and increasingly globalizing world sincere or is it designed to prevent competition in the US market Why advise developing countries to emulate the worlds losers rather than the winners A dominant aspect of US foreign policy today is to promote democracy wherever this seems feasible such as in Latin America and the Caribbean East Asia Africa and the transition nations of the former Soviet Union This is a laudable effort At the same time however the most severe US trade restrictions are directed against imports from developing countriessuch as sugar and textile products from just about everywhere orange juice from Brazil and steel from many developed and developing countries alike US foreign aid now represents percent of our gross national product placing it at the bottom of the list of donor countries Our slogan used to be trade not aid Now it is more like not too much trade and very little aid It is extremely difficult for poor countries to establish stable democracies Achieving this obective is made even more complex by the inherent contradiction in US policypreaching democracy even as we limit the ability of these countries to obtain the resources necessary to make democracy possible During the past year much invective has been hurled at key multilateral institutions established at the end of World War II This was evident in Seattle late last year when protesters tried to disrupt the meetings of the World Trade Organization the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which came into being in and again last month in Prague during the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund It is not clear why the demonstrations were directed against these institutions rather than at the countries which determine the institutions policies They are not supranational bodies but rather creatures of their masters the worlds most powerful national governments It is troubling when nongovernmental organizations exercise their right of free speech by preventing delegates to international meetings from exercising their right of free speech We should not be troubled however when serious nongovernmental observers act constructively to change practices they find offensive The IMF has long been ultrasecretive about its analyses and findings this is inappropriate for an institution that obtains its funds from national governments ie from taxpayers The WTOs disputesettlement procedures which are an important part of that organizations work have themselves been overly secretive Many of these practices are changing and the outside critics deserve much of the credit for this greater openness The president of the World Bank James Wolfensohn has exerted great effort to make the banks work more transparent At the same time he exaggerates incorrigibly so He implies that the bank under his leadership has discovered that economic growth while necessary is not sufficient to achieve widespread social development There are many examples of this attitude Only one will be cited The old approach of an exclusive focus on growth as the elixir for all the worlds problems is thus too circumscribed oped by Wolfensohn and Joseph Stiglitz Financial Times September Wolfensohns emphasis on alleviating poverty is praiseworthy but the trashing of all the foreign aid practitioners who preceded him for not understanding the multiple aspects of development is egregiously inaccurate and ungracious The World Banks World Development Report is devoted exclusively to attacking poverty It approaches this theme citing three areas for action creating opportunities empowering the poor and providing greater security against the risks the poor face The study contains a mountain of data and undoubtedly will be a valuable reference source for years to come What it fails to do however is to explain how the World Bank can achieve these goals particularly empowerment which it admits depends on the interaction of political social and other institutional processes Is this the role of the World Bank Issues in International Political Economy

in International Political Economy In this issue Dr Weintraub compares exchange rate management in Mexico Argentina and Brazil To go directly to the web version click on simonchairissueshtm For further information please contact Veronica Prado at or She will be replacing me as Sidney Weintraubs research assistant effective this Friday January th Best wishes to all Rebecca Tunstall ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY January Number REJECTING THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE Sidney Weintraub The turmoil that Argentina is now going through is so costly for the majority of the Argentinean population that it demands some answers to the question Did it have to happen The same question arose when the Mexican financial structure imploded in My single word answer in both cases is No In each case the disaster followed a similaralthough not identicaltrajectory and in each case the political and technical authorities made a bet that they could manage discredited practices And in each case they failed thereby visiting great suffering on their populations The precipitating event of the Argentine debacle was an overvalued and ultimately untenable exchange rate The convertibility scheme adopted in was brilliant in its simplicity By assuring the public that enough dollars were to be held in official reserves to cover the monetary base and thereby guarantee that pesos could be exchanged for dollars on demand even a skeptical public found the approach credible Runaway inflation was stopped in its tracks Overall economic growth rates soared at least for a while The technique was a variant of the Mexican experiment that began in using the exchange rate as the anchor to defeat inflation What did in the Argentine experiment was the appreciation of the US dollar This led inevitably under onetoone convertibility to the appreciation of the Argentine peso and despite the preaching of ideologues that it is immoral to alter an exchange rate the price of a countrys moneyits exchange ratedoes affect its exports and imports On top of this Brazil devalued its currency the real in and what Argentina faced was the appreciation of its currency while that of the country that took onethird of its exports depreciated Argentina nevertheless retained the overvalued exchange rate and in the process further destroyed the countrys competitive position Inflation was kept in check but the country has suffered economic downturn ever since This description omits other aspects of Argentinas economic political and social situation These include relatively modest fiscal deficits the public sector borrowing requirement averaged about percent of GDP between and at the national and provincial levels combined growing social inequality and poverty too many feckless politicians who looked at government service as a source of enrichment and reckless borrowing public and private domestic and foreign Argentina met its debt obligations by more borrowing but this was a large Ponzi scheme because the inability to earn enough foreign exchange from exports meant that the rigid onetoone structure had to collapse sooner or later Mexico in adopted a form of price controls under what was called a pacto de solidaridad to lower its inflation The pacto or agreement called for the private sector to limit price increases labor to limit wage demands and the government to control its expenditures When the pacto started Mexico devalued its currency sharply to leave room for appreciation of the peso in order to prevent devaluation from raising inflation The pactos were kept in place with annual modifications from through The anchor for Mexicos antiinflation policy was an increasingly overvalued peso Inflation declined gradually year after year rather than abruptly as it did in Argentina after convertibility but economic growth in Mexico in these years was modest As in Argentina the Mexican political authorities the president and the technicians the finance minister with the cooperation of the head of the central bank were unwilling to change the exchangerate structure a form of crawling peg Instead they took the risk that they could delay devaluation until some time in the future There was general agreement that the Mexican peso was overvalued and the way the authorities dealt with this in foreign borrowing was to issue shortterm notes that had a dollar guaranteethe socalled tesobonos This house of cards collapsed in December about three weeks after the previous president left office The Mexican authorities gambled and the population lost As in Argentina there were other elements in the Mexican collapse There were assassinations of political leaders during the US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate six times during the year seriously affecting Mexico the government budget was kept in balance but development banks were allowed to provide uncollected credit that amounted to some percent of GDP political corruption continued much as before and foreign borrowing on short terms and at dollar equivalents rose sharply even as official reserves declined from capital flight and efforts to support the exchange rate In the end however what did Mexico in was an overvalued exchange rate that was kept in place far too long In the case of Brazil the scenario unfolded differently The real plan was put in place in mid in an effort to reduce inflation without burdening economic growth As in Mexico in Brazil the stable exchange rate worked and inflation was reduced Brazil weathered the tequila effect of December when the Mexican peso depreciated without any sharp change in the real plan However Brazil was hit sharply by the aftereffects of the Russian debt default in because investors either had to cover positions or became nervous about keeping capital in Brazil given its precarious situation In January Brazil devalued the real and took other corrective measures Brazil did not have the turmoil that either Mexico or Argentina faced when they were forced to devalue under the most adverse circumstances Brazil acted more quickly before a deepening crisis made action exceedingly costly The currencies of Brazil and Mexico are both floating and thus far the mechanism is working Argentina has announced that it will allow its currency to float for domestic transactions but that it will be controlled for foreign trade That is Argentina will have a dual exchange rate system justified by the assertion that because the onetoone structure was in effect for so long the country needed six months for moving to a single floating currency Argentinas new president Eduardo Duhalde has also stated that the countrys opening to imports has been a disaster and that trade policy will become more nationalistic protectionist At this point two comments Dual exchange rates have a history of failure especially by abetting corruption Argentina has tried protectionism before especially under Juan Pern and it did little other than to increasingly impoverish the country In the interest of Argentinas future one can only hope that the dual exchangerate system does not last very long and that the economic nationalism will not be too severe The deeper issue is to ask why government leaders pursue policies that have a history of failures This is a task for psychologists not economists but I will give it a try It is politically unpopular to devalue a currency therefore why not push off the unpleasantness for as long as possible The suffering for doing this will come later perhaps on someone elses watch Memories are shortthose of the politicians and technicians who repeat past mistakes and of the general public In addition memories often gild the past forgetting that Latin Americas poverty and inequality were created during periods of past protectionism Intelligent leaders become wedded to policies they put in place and are often emotionally unable to change what they have been doing Domingo Cavallo was fabulously successful as economics minister in Argentina in the early part of the s and dismally incorrect in his actions when he returned in the De la Ra government in the same position In Mexico in both President Salinas and Finance Minister Pedro Aspe were so adamant about not devaluing the peso that they excluded technicians from policy deliberations when they did not agree with this position It is understandable that many analysts and business leaders prefer fixed exchange rates When things are going well this provides a degree of certainty However the time to judge the effectiveness of an exchangerate mechanism is when the system is under pressure This explains the attractiveness of floating exchange rates for countries prone to economic shocks It is clear from what is happening in Argentina and what took place in Mexico in that fixed rateseven a relatively hard fix of the type that Argentina hadcan spell disaster when a country is under economic pressure Perhaps this lesson will stickat least for a time Issues in International Political Economy is produced by the William E Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and

Issues in International Political Economy for the month of October This month Dr Weintraub focuses on the argument that the treatment for the cause of the terrorist attacks lies in reducing poverty To go directly to the web version click on simonchairissueshtm For further information please contact Rebecca Tunstall at ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY October Number THE TERRORIST ATTACK TREATING THE CAUSES Sidney Weintraub We have been hearing much since September that the United States to avoid future terrorist attacks must treat the causes Which causes Should the treatment deal with reversing the terrorists hatred for the United States eliminating antiJewish sentiment correcting the lack of freedom in most MiddleEastern countries refighting the Kosovo war and getting some Americans killed making too many or too few charges against foreign human rights violations eliminating homosexuality and civil liberties in the United States as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson seem to believe altering the capitalist system that prevails in the developed countries changing the US lifestyles that so infuriate Muslim zealots reducing poverty No shortage of causes some outrageous others idiosyncratic and some even with a sense of legitimacy have been put forward that should be treated The monthly commentaries in this issues series deal with political economy and I will stick mostly to the last and focus on poverty However this must be prefaced with a caveat I find it impossible that anyone can seriously believe that because there is much poverty in the Middle East terrorists who are not themselves poor concluded that the corrective was to attack the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and kill thousands of innocent people I am focusing on poverty because it is a global scourge and we would have a better world if poverty could be reduced drastically One consequence of the events on September will be to sharply increase poverty because of the ripple effects on developing countries from the economic troubles of the United States and other industrial countries Markets for the goods and services of developing countries will shrink as will investment in them When the economies of rich countries decline the suffering from the fallout is usually greater in poor countries This for better or worse is part of globalism Many implicitly assume that the reduction of poverty has been neglected up until now This is not true What is correct however is that the world has not been overwhelmingly effective in dealing with the problem The number of people who live below the poverty line is now about billion This is an enormous figure even though the proportion of the worlds population living in poverty has declined more in the past years than in the previous years The absolute number however has risen Poverty is not an independent manifestation isolated from development strategies and politics within countries but part and parcel of the bigger picture I have not understood the motivations of the protesters who show up to disrupt meetings of international development and trade organizations because precisely these institutions have taken the lead to reduce poverty Poverty did not begin with globalization The proportion of people living in poverty has not increased because globalization has made communications and financial transfers more efficient than ever before If anything globalization is an opportunity to reduce levels of poverty because linkages between developed and developing countries are now so intense Poverty reduction clearly goes handinhand with economic growth Overall economic growth is insufficient to reduce poverty but it is the essential ingredient Redistribution without growth merely rearranges the scenery but does not get at the core of the problem Povertyreduction policy therefore must be an ingredient of development policy And that is the rub no simple surefire formula exists for converting a stagnant lowincome country into a vibrant one with a growing economy Development is a slow slogging arduous process that must deal with bigpicture matters such as macroeconomic policy and microeconomic issues of industrial and agricultural development and the building of solid institutions Education must be a priority and this cannot be accomplished in one decade or one generation Infant mortality is higher and life expectancy is lower in developing countries because of inadequate health care Countries need roads to bring goods to market equity in land tenure ports an adequate and safe water supply and the infrastructure that makes development possible Poverty reduction if all of these needs are met must then be a conscious part of government programs which is why bumpersticker slogans like Reduce Poverty are fatuous By all means let us work to reduce poverty but the issue must be treated more seriously than a politicians or an editorialists spin might suggest The history of todays developed countries as widely documented is that poverty actually increased during the early years of the development process Investments during the early days of the growth process tended to direct resources to immediately productive activities and only after the cumulative effects of these development accomplishments reached a pivotal point did poverty and inequality decline Thus one may make a case for directing more resources to developing countries but they must be part of a viable development program And yes the United States has not in recent years been a generous aid donor in relation to the US gross domestic product Politicians say that foreign aid is not popular because it helps foreigners Yes it does but what is wrong with that The discussion of poverty reduction can be brought specifically to the situation in the Middle East and South Asia Most people in those regions which seem to be the cradle of the terrorism movement live in poverty Not a single country in the Middle East save Israel has a democratic government Population growth rates are high and this adds to the costs of development Yet the priorities of dictatorial leaders whether religious or otherwise are not economicsor reducing povertybut a host of other issues from religious fanaticism to political dominance to a hatred of neighbors Is this situation mainly the fault of the United States Does the existence of Israel impoverish its Arab enemies The answer to both questions is of course no Has the United States made errors in the ways it has interacted with countries in the Middle East Has Israel Yes both countries have But to then leap from this to the assertion that the attacks were justified that the United States got what it deserved is insane Has the United States provided benefits and favors to countries in the Middle East The answer is surely yes more so than any other country Countries make their own development policies Unless a country makes a development policy its own the reality that aid will accomplish little has long been a truism among developmentassistance practitioners Donor countries and agencies can give advice and provide technical and financial resources but they cannot impose programs that national leaders do not want a lesson that has been learned repeatedly Aid donors cannot eliminate corruption leaders of countries must do that The donors cannot insist that dictatorial regimes be transformed into democracies they can withhold aid or they can grant it and hope that some start at development will lead to more satisfactory regimes If economic development and the installation of democracy are unimportant in the agendas of foreign leaders neither the United States nor other donors have much power to alter the situation To return to where this commentary began poverty is a deepseated plague one that the world must deal with on moral and practical grounds However it is impossible to will away poverty this takes consistent dedication Poverty has been reduced sharply in some countries because their leaders and priorities of governance sincerely sought economic growth and poverty reduction The number of poor has been reduced as a proportion of world population because of the economic system put into effect after World War II However the job is far from accomplished and deserves a sustained effort to do better in the future Issues in International Political Economy is produced by the William E Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International

several decades perhaps more than on any other theme I have a daughter who was born in Mexico and feel warmly toward the country My research visits conversations and analysis provide many insightseven if imperfect knowledge Examination of this relationship became a national pastime last week when President Vicente Fox made a highly publicized state visit to the United States The overused clich was that the United States had a lovehate attitude toward Mexico This is too strong the emotions never ran that deep The duality of feeling was more like hopedisdaina wish that Mexico would deal with its deep economic social and political problems and at the same time an attitude of condescension that Mexico never seemed to accomplish this The Mexican duality toward the United States was something on the order of ambiguitymistrustshould we embrace the United States or keep our distance out of wariness that Mexico might be betrayed at crucial moments Fox in his speech to a joint session of the US Congress on September said that the moment of change particularly for Mexico was when NAFTA came into existence at the beginning of I agree with this judgment NAFTA was the most profound agreement between the two countries in the twentieth century NAFTA in my view used trade and investment as the route to longterm political embrace and the extent to which this will go will be unknown for perhaps years I must confess that I had little sympathy with the NAFTA naysayers in either country because I felt that they lacked a sense of what neighborly relations could bebut instead focused on their particular interests or foibles and not on how two countries thrown together by fate could and should handle their neighborly destinies The obscenity of a rich United States coexisting with a poor neighbor is unhealthy for both because it spawns such problems as undocumented migration and is perpetually destabilizing The US reception of Fox was remarkably warm The Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI brought NAFTA into existence but it was Foxs victory in the July presidential contest that alerted the US audience that our neighbor to the south was transforming itself into a democracy A troubled neighbor an important economic partner and a country that had shed much of its political authoritarianismFox embodied all these attributes Yet considerable condescension toward Mexico remains in the US body politic as it does in popular sentiment The congressional vote to prohibit Mexican trucks from crossing the border to deliver goods throughout the United Statesdespite a commitment to do so in an agreement approved by Congresswas an illustration of this Domestic politics was more important to the US Congress than the Mexican relationship more important than keeping the US word If instead of Mexico this had been a disagreement with Canada or the United Kingdom or Germany would Congress have acted as it did I doubt it Will Congress give up its insistence on certifying Mexicos behavior in the fight against drug use It has not until now despite the evident futility and resentment caused by this practice Maybe now it will If so chalk this up to Fox The central theme of Foxs speeches in the United States was trust Trust your neighbor and he will return this sentiment Punish your neighbor to force him to change his ways and you will earn no trust in returnnor is he likely to change his ways Fox is correct that this trust does not yet exist in full measure in either direction The reason for this goes back to another clich about the relationshipthat it is asymmetric Mexican analysts invoke asymmetry constantly Economic asymmetry explains migration from Mexico to the United States power asymmetry explains the fluctuating US attention on Mexico democratic asymmetry explains the differences in the administration of justice historic asymmetry explains the mutual mistrust One could continue endlessly the asymmetry is real and it has consequences The United States is most comfortable in its relations with other developed countries those that have reasonably comparable per capita incomes Maybe some day Mexican incomes will approach those in the United States but not for many years The United States has close relationships with countries that share some of the burden of common defense This is unlikely for Mexico Achieving truly mature relations will require other accomplishments more trade and investment sustained economic growth in Mexico a deepening of democracy a reduction in Mexican corruption an equitable system of justice and an end to the need for Mexicans to emigrate in violation of US laws to support themselves and their families A superiordependent situation does not permit a dialogue of equals The two countries separate but intertwined histories have left a legacy of hangups on both sides Historical experience explains much about Mexicos drive to retain its economic and political independence and why it chose to remain distant from its powerful neighbor This exercise in limited engagement was reciprocated in the United States Mexico was seen as a troublesome neighbor a povertyridden country that could not provide jobs for all of its people but instead had to rely on the escape valve of migration to the United States It was not too many years ago that a bestseller was entitled Bordering on Chaos Fox did not initiate the changes taking place in Mexico Many initiatives in addition to NAFTA preceded his election Mexico had long had a policy of avoiding the discussion of migration issues with the United States but then undertook a joint study of this subject under President Ernesto Zedillo that was published in The electoral laws that permitted Foxs election obviously had to be enacted beforehand The conclusion that engagement with the United States was preferable to distancing it was made before Fox Fox owes a deep debt of gratitude to Zedillo for relinquishing the leadership without a financial crisis something that had eluded PRI presidents for some years What the Mexican leadership concluded before Fox was that economic independence was a charade given the limited size of the Mexican domestic market and the inability in any event to escape the consequences of US economic policies I have long believed that the most important US actions toward Mexico are taken without regard to their effects on Mexicoactions like raising and lowering the federal funds rate and managing the US economy so as to achieve growth It is the level of this growth that rejects or stimulates imports from Mexico When NAFTA was negotiated the Mexican assessment was that national cultural identity need not be sacrificed in the pursuit of economic development Indeed without this development a majority of Mexicans would have been excluded from the bulk of the nations rich cultural offerings The United States responded positively to the Salinas proposal for free trade under the first President George Bush Presidents Bill Clinton and now George W Bush have pushed this engagement further The laggard has been the US Congress because of a variety of parochial interests and an inability to shed longingrained habits of disrespect for Mexico Fox will not achieve all he seeks immediatelyespecially on US immigration policy Maybe never but I doubt this What his visit demonstrates is that he came to power at a propitious time found a sympathetic ear in the person of the US president and has moved the negotiating agenda forward This is not the end gamethat must occur internally in each of the two countriesbut it is a giant leap Issues in International Political Economy is published by the William E Simon Chair in Political Economy at

Political Economy Center for Strategic and International Studies p f ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY October Number TELLING IT LIKE IT IS Sidney Weintraub This is my curmudgeon commentary Its barbs are directed against exaggeration double talk and scapegoating of important institutions engaged in global economic development I do not intend in what follows to disparage the importance of labor unions in protecting the rights and benefits of workers or to argue that the United States is a protectionist nation or to doubt the valuable work that is done by multilateral institutions My purpose rather is to highlight a few points the hypocrisy that exists when imports of goods and services from poor countries are restricted while simultaneously insisting that this exclusion will benefit workers in those countries the inconsistency of promoting democracy in developing countries even as we neglect the interplay of foreign trade economic wellbeing and political outcomes the perpetuation of the fiction that multilateral institutions are independent actors that behave supranationally in ways that conflict with the desires of their powerful members and the misconception that institutions such as the World Bank provide a service by promising more than they can deliver The leaders of organized labor in the United States opposed NAFTA and the grant of permanent normal trading relations with China They are also against a free trade area of the Americas and opening a new round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization The stated basis for this opposition is that the United States should not further liberalize its import structure until other countries accept core labor standards right of association power to organize and bargain collectively prohibition against forced labor minimum age for employment of children and acceptable working conditions and that punishment should be meted out in the form of US import restrictions when these standards are violated Is this protectionism or a socially conscious initiative to upgrade labor conditions in poor countries The leaders of poor countries insist that they too want to raise labor standards but cannot do this if their export earnings are restricted The practical result of the US position is that meaningful trade negotiations are not going forward Even though labor leaders insist this is not about protectionism it sure looks like protectionism Former senator Dale Bumpers has noted that when politicians say something is not about money it is about money World Bank analysis has shown persuasively that the developing countries that have made the most progress in raising incomes are those that have opened their markets and engaged actively in world trade However there are still antitrade advocates who advise todays developing countries to look inward just as many of todays developed countries focused first on internal markets and protecting their producers against foreign competitors This was Alexander Hamiltons advice to the newborn United States It was the development pattern for Japan It was Ral Prebischs advice to Latin American countries Although this advice may have had some relevance once upon a time for countries with large or potentially large internal markets such as Brazil it surely does not for countries with tiny markets like many in Latin America the Caribbean and Africa The lesson of postWorld War II development history is that countries that looked outward such as those in East Asia grew rapidly while those that looked inward as in Latin America were relatively stagnant Is the advice to poor countries to look inward in the modern and increasingly globalizing world sincere or is it designed to prevent competition in the US market Why advise developing countries to emulate the worlds losers rather than the winners A dominant aspect of US foreign policy today is to promote democracy wherever this seems feasible such as in Latin America and the Caribbean East Asia Africa and the transition nations of the former Soviet Union This is a laudable effort At the same time however the most severe US trade restrictions are directed against imports from developing countriessuch as sugar and textile products from just about everywhere orange juice from Brazil and steel from many developed and developing countries alike US foreign aid now represents percent of our gross national product placing it at the bottom of the list of donor countries Our slogan used to be trade not aid Now it is more like not too much trade and very little aid It is extremely difficult for poor countries to establish stable democracies Achieving this obective is made even more complex by the inherent contradiction in US policypreaching democracy even as we limit the ability of these countries to obtain the resources necessary to make democracy possible During the past year much invective has been hurled at key multilateral institutions established at the end of World War II This was evident in Seattle late last year when protesters tried to disrupt the meetings of the World Trade Organization the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which came into being in and again last month in Prague during the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund It is not clear why the demonstrations were directed against these institutions rather than at the countries which determine the institutions policies They are not supranational bodies but rather creatures of their masters the worlds most powerful national governments It is troubling when nongovernmental organizations exercise their right of free speech by preventing delegates to international meetings from exercising their right of free speech We should not be troubled however when serious nongovernmental observers act constructively to change practices they find offensive The IMF has long been ultrasecretive about its analyses and findings this is inappropriate for an institution that obtains its funds from national governments ie from taxpayers The WTOs disputesettlement procedures which are an important part of that organizations work have themselves been overly secretive Many of these practices are changing and the outside critics deserve much of the credit for this greater openness The president of the World Bank James Wolfensohn has exerted great effort to make the banks work more transparent At the same time he exaggerates incorrigibly so He implies that the bank under his leadership has discovered that economic growth while necessary is not sufficient to achieve widespread social development There are many examples of this attitude Only one will be cited The old approach of an exclusive focus on growth as the elixir for all the worlds problems is thus too circumscribed oped by Wolfensohn and Joseph Stiglitz Financial Times September Wolfensohns emphasis on alleviating poverty is praiseworthy but the trashing of all the foreign aid practitioners who preceded him for not understanding the multiple aspects of development is egregiously inaccurate and ungracious The World Banks World Development Report is devoted exclusively to attacking poverty It approaches this theme citing three areas for action creating opportunities empowering the poor and providing greater security against the risks the poor face The study contains a mountain of data and undoubtedly will be a valuable reference source for years to come What it fails to do however is to explain how the World Bank can achieve these goals particularly empowerment which it admits depends on the interaction of political social and other institutional processes Is this the role of the World Bank Issues in International Political Economy

International Political Economy entitled Critical Aspects of the Global Economy To go directly to the web version please click on americaspubsweintraubnewslettershtml For further information contact Rebecca Tunstall ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY November Number CRITICAL ASPECTS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY Sidney Weintraub When the word globalization is uttered it evokes two contradictory visceral reactions it is either the essential element of recent US competitiveness or it is inherently evil because the global spread of multinational corporations enriches the wealthy and economically powerful at the expense of the vast multitude of workers In what follows I will avoid both attacks and praise and instead focus on key features of international trade and investment that characterize what is taking place in much of the world A country if its dictatorial leader so insists can set its own prohibitive tariff and import structure and reject foreign investment North Korea and Vietnam both nondemocratic did this for many years despite the horrible cost this policy imposed on national welfare This isolation is breaking down in these two countries even as it did earlier in China after the death of Mao and for much the same reason Eternal poverty is not a good formula for regime continuity Guarding economic sovereignty did not take the same absolutist form in most other countries but a profound transformation is taking place in them as well Import barriers are coming down and attacks against foreign investment are being transmuted into searches to attract foreign investment Mexico before its debt collapse in favored external borrowing over investment to obtain foreign exchange but learned to its dismay that this practice contained its own risks when the debt could not be serviced The philosophic base of development then changed and foreign investment was actively sought as an essential requirement for Mexico to augment its exports This outlook was the premise of NAFTA Hugo Chvez the president of Venezuela rails against primitive neoliberalism neoliberalismo salvaje but nevertheless has kept the countrys import tariffs relatively low even as he makes a great effort to obtain foreign direct investment to develop his countrys telecommunications and natural gas activities Chvez so far has shown a tendency to talk like a Marxist much like Fidel Castro his romantic icon but then act like a capitalist For many of the worlds poorest countries the primordial problem is not the spread of multinational corporations but their inability to participate in the process This is especially true in subSaharan Africa Their poverty small internal markets and accompanying political instability make them poor destinations for foreign investment other than to exploit minerals for export This does not lead to substantial job creation Both foreign direct investment and international trade are growing more rapidly than world economic growth This is a clear manifestation that the foreign aspect of the world economy is becoming increasingly important If one looks back only years when the dominant economic model in Latin America was to develop behind high import barriers and to downplay the importance of exports it is startling how much development thinking has changed in that part of the world East Asia with its export orientation became the model and not the preachings of those who advised Latin America to look inward The bulk of the worlds trade is carried on by large corporations This is not a new phenomenon These same corporations are large investors in foreign manufacturing and service activities Indeed the two phenomenainvesting and producing in foreign countries and then selling much of the output in still other foreign countries as well as the home marketare inseparable International trade is increasingly taking place in intermediate rather than final productschips for computers parts for office machinery engines for automobiles and trucks cotton and wool fabrics for apparel Look under the hood of your car the transmission assembly may have elements produced in a number of countries The assembly line in Detroit works on a justintime basis to receive the material needed from across the border in Windsor Ontarioand beware of a slowdown from a customs snafu that leads to a costly disruption in the manufacturing process This goes by the name coproduction The parts are produced in a variety of locations assembled in other places and sold globally Much of the sales are within the same multinational corporation say from a parent to a subsidiary intrafirm trade or within the same sector intraindustry trade As goods pass across borders in this fashion the absence of border impediments tariffs lengthy inspection delays is crucial as the automotive example between Windsor and Detroit exemplifies Hence the drive for trade negotiations to lower these barriers and the proliferation of regional economic integration agreements such as NAFTA to legally ensure the absence of delays in a justintime world Economic integration and by extension the process of globalization is centered on competition in particular sectors when it comes to production and merchandise trade What is taking place is a form of division of laborAdam Smith on a regional and global scale The global aspect is made possible by technology advances in communication and transportation and by financing far more vast than anything seen before Corporations take many factors into account when setting up complementary plants in foreign countries such as size of the domestic market the availability and price of labor the cost of transportation and the political stability of the country where the investment is made The growth of US coproduction with Mexico was based primarily on two considerations proximity and thus low transportation costs and inexpensive labor Most foreign direct investment is made among industrial countries which is evidence that cheap labor is by no means always the dominant criterion This is evident as well from the paucity of investment in the worlds poorest countries If most international trade is conducted by large corporations what does this imply for the future of small and mediumsized enterprises In just about all countries goods and services that are not internationally traded are more voluminous than tradables In addition many large corporations have concluded that making all inputs inhouse is not the most efficient practice and instead are subcontracting to independent producers and service providersand many of these are relatively small enterprises Their products are then exported indirectly via the exports of the large corporations There is no intent in this discussion to assert that multinational corporations invariably provide their workers with optimal working conditions and good salaries and are always careful to avoid environmental degradation in their operations We know that many corporations are not that meticulous even though we also know that wages and working conditions in foreign transplants generally are superior to those of domestic enterprises We know that foreign trade and investment results in losers in the home countries although by now it is clear that there are many more winners We know that the global spread of business benefits some countries more than others and that some regions of countries prosper while others lag behind The globalization geniein the form of investment trade financial flows and technology advancesis out of the bottle The challenges are to minimize the downside dangers while exploiting the upside benefits that globalization can offer to countries
