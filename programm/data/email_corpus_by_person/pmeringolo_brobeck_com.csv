<14880469.1075853208771.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,pmeringolo@brobeck.com,2001-02-28 10:57:00,Status of Duke Energy v State and ISO v Reliant et al Cc Per Garys request here is the status of Duke Energy v Governor Davis and ISO v Reliant Duke v State of California According to a news article on February Duke Energy Corp suspended its lawsuit against Gray Davis and the State after the California Department of Water Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that was formerly being provided under contracts with two financially trouble utilities Originally Duke argued that Governor Davis exceeded his authority under the Emergency Services Act when he commandeered Dukes longterm contracts The case is suspended until an April hearing I am trying to obtain a copy of any order andor stipulation filed with the Court ISO v Reliant et al I Brief Summary of Complaint In ISO v Reliant et al ISO seeks a preliminary injunction to require six Reliant entities Williams Energy Marketing Trading four AES entities and Dynegy Power Corporation collectively Defendants to provide generation in response to ISOs emergency dispatch instructions ISOs sole allegation is that because Defendants submitted to the ISO Tariff by participating in the ISO markets and by entering into Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and Participating Generator Agreements Defendants cannot refuse to generate in response to an emergency dispatch order This allegation is based upon section of the Tariff II Current Status of the Case February Stipulation On February the parties entered a stipulation which states in relevant part The Reliant Defendants Williams and Dynegy collectively Generator Defendants will comply with emergency dispatch orders of the California ISO under the terms of the ISO tariff without regard to whether ISO allocates the cost of power produced in response to such a dispatch order to a creditworthy Scheduling Coorindator until the earlier of the following a pm Pacific Standard Time on March or b two business days but in no event less than hours after written notice to this Court and the parties by a Generator Defendant that this stipulated obligation is terminated as to it Notice of termination by a Generator Defendant of its obligation under paragraph b shall not affect the stipulated obligations or remaining Generator Defendants except that on receipt of such notice each remaining Generator Defendant shall have the right to file with the Court an election terminating its obligation In the event of such an election the obligation of a terminating Generator Defendant to comply with ISO dispatch orders imposed by paragraph shall end hours after written notice to ISO of the election to terminate Each terminating Generator Defendant shall have the same right and status to participate in any legal proceedings that follow the initial notice of termination including any appeal The motions heard by this Court on February including ISOs motion for preliminary injunction Reliants motion to dismiss or stay pursuant to the FERC order and DWRs motion to dismiss Reliants third party complaint will be deemed submitted at pm on March or at pm on the day written notice of termination of the obligation stipulated in paragraph is filed with the Court whichever is earlier III February th Hearing Below is a summary of the hearing held on February th in the Reliant case which I initially prepared on Saturday February th I apologize if you did not receive this earlier The hearing involved three motions A ISOs Motion for Preliminary Injunction B Reliants Motion to Dismiss or Stay C DWRs Motion to Dismiss Third Party Complaint Judge Damrell took each motion under submission and stated that he will issue an order on or before February at pm He ordered the February TRO to remain in effect until then Judge Damrell clarified that the TRO requires Defendants to respond to all ISO Emergency Dispatch Orders EDOs regardless of the creditworthiness of the purchasers The Judge encouraged Defendants to stipulate that they would respond to ISO EDOs and gave Defendants until February to do so It appears that only AES is willing to do so at this time Summary ISOs Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Reliants Motion to Dismiss Stay are linked in that they essentially relate to the same issue Are generators obligated to respond to EDOs despite having no assurances that they will be paid ie assurances that a creditworthy purchaser will be buying the generation in response to the EDO A Reliants Motion to Dismiss or to Stay Reliants motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay was based solely upon a February FERC order conditionally adopting ISOs proposed Amendment This FERC Order as I understand it from the arguments allows ISO to waive the creditworthy requirement only with respect to PGE and SCE scheduling of energy to meet their own load Parsing the Order Reliant argued that the Order implicitly means that the creditworthy requirement is not waived with respect to all other purchases including EDOs Because of the FERC Order Reliant argued that ISOs complaint which seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to respond to EDOs without assurances of creditworthiness should be dismissed Alternatively Reliant argued that because the proceeding before FERC continues the Court should stay this case pending the outcome by FERC ISO argued that according to the language of the FERC Order FERC explicitly did not rule on the issue related to the application of the creditworthiness requirement to EDOs And a stay is improper because due to energy crisis ISO cannot wait for FERC to decide this issue Analysis Judge Damrell appeared very skeptical of Reliants interpretation of the Order He asked If FERC intended that the creditworthy requirements apply to EDO why didnt it address it headon especially because the importance of this issue was raised by Dynegy before FERC He questioned Reliant about several sentences in the Order which suggest that FERC explicitly did not decide the issue Judge Damrell is unlikely to stay the proceedings He stated that the exigencies of the situation are such that he perhaps he should not wait for FERC to rule He made several comments about how long it takes FERC to act and that the Federal Courts should step in times of crisis such as this B ISOs Motion for Preliminary Injunction In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction to require Defendants to provide generation in response to EDOs ISO argued as follows Defendants submitted to the ISO Tariff by participating in the ISO markets and by entering into Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and Participating Generator Agreements Section of the Tariff obligates Defendants to respond to EDOs EDOs are essential to keep the lights on and because the decision to issue EDOs are made only in times of emergencies the ISO does not look at who the purchaser is is not required to by the Tariff and should not be required to because of the current energy crisis Defendants argued that they need not respond to an EDO without assurances that they would be selling to a creditworthy purchaser because the creditworthy requirement is an essential element of the Tariff and a FERC Order held that the creditworthy requirement applies even EDOs Dynegy raised an additional argument ISO and DWR are using the EDO procedures to get a price below market and that there is no real threat that the lights will go out According to Dynegy DWR can back real time purchases including EDOs but instead DWR backs only purchases at a certain price below market If generators refuse ISO issues an EDO with no assurances that the generators will get paid as a strong arm tactic to get this below market price Dynegy argued that the reality is that the lights will not go out because if generators do not abide by the EDOs DWR has enough money to buy at market rate There would be no issue here if DWR would pay the just and reasonable rate for the electricity rather than using EDO procedures to lower the rate And DWR can go to FERC if it believes that the rate is unjust and unreasonable Analysis Judge Damrell certainly appeared to be leaning towards the ISO He expressed his views that this case involves a narrow issue do the Defendants have an obligation to respond to EDOs without assurances that it will get paid in this time of crisis His questions and comments suggest that he believes that the amount of energy subject to the EDOs is small and necessary to avert rolling blackouts He questioned Mr Detmer manager of operation of ISO who suggested that about of purchases at peak are made through EDOs Judge Damrell was not very sympathetic towards Dynegys argument asking Are you was saying that DWR ISO and the State are the cause of the crisis Several times Judge Damrell stated that he thought the high wholesale prices caused the crisis According to Judge Damrell the simple fact is you got rich and the utilities went broke Also as noted above Judge Damrell does not believe that waiting for FERC to make decisions is the proper course in the current energy crisis because FERC does not act quickly enough C DWRs Motion to Dismiss rd Party Complaint Reliant brought a third party complaint against DWR and DWR moved to dismiss As framed by the Court the key issue is does th Amendment prohibit Reliant from joining DWR in the case Judge Damrell asked about the th Amendment immunity argument stating that the issue was not thoroughly briefed The Judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue I am obtaining a copy of these supplemental briefs and I will summarize DWRs argument in a subsequent email Peter P Meringolo Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Spear Tower

to the CPUC Thanks Peter PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions
