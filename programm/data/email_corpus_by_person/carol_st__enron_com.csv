Aron from English law perspective Alan Original Message From Firth Simon N simon inklaterscomENRON Sent Wednesday November PM To Saxena Rahul Firth Simon N Cc Aronowitz Alan Cooper Edmund Simons Paul Evans Mark London Legal Subject RE Enron Email Goldman SachsJ Aron You asked me to consider whether there would be any advantage to Enron in entering into this agreement given the limitations we discussed yesterday My conclusion is that the agreement would assist Enron in the event of a default by a member of the Goldman Sachs group and there is nothing as a matter of English law at least that would make it imprudent to enter into the agreement The reason why I think the agreement assists Enron is that absent a winding up of a counterparty under English law the courts will generally uphold contractual setoff arrangements There are obvious advantages to having an arrangement under which if one member of the Goldman Sachs group experiences credit problems Enron can close out all its positions at the same time and set them off against each other It is true that if one of the counterparties is subject to English law winding up proceedings the setoff will not be effective because only mutual obligations can be set off against each other and this requires two parties which are acting in the same capacity However this should not affect its validity vis a vis other counterparties and in particular will not affect the enforceability of the netting provisions under the individual master agreements Mutuality is not required outside a winding up where the setoff is based on contract The fact that a counterparty is in administration would not prevent the setoff from being upheld whether as regards that counterparty or any of the others I have obviously just focussed on English law One point I note however is that Section c states that any automatic termination provision in the underlying master agreements is inapplicable This is not a concern as a matter of English law because automatic early termination is not required for the netting arrangements to be enforceable However the position is different in certain other jurisdictions Germany for example The risk is that this provision will affect the underlying netting arrangements as regards counterparties incorporated in those jurisdictions As Paul pointed out yesterday the fact that the multilateral netting arrangements would not be enforceable on an insolvency means that you cannot regard them as creating a net position for regulatory capital purposes although this does not affect the recognition of the netting under each underlying agreement I hope this is helpful If you would like detailed points on the agreement please let me know Original Message From Saxena Rahul mailto

Aronowitz Alan Sent Wednesday November PM To Cook Mary St Clair Carol Subject FW Enron Email Goldman SachsJ Aron FYI Simon is with Linklaters in London and reviewed the draft Agreement Goldman SachsJ Aron from English law perspective Alan Original Message From Firth Simon N simon inklaterscomENRON Sent Wednesday November PM To Saxena Rahul Firth Simon N Cc Aronowitz Alan Cooper Edmund Simons Paul Evans Mark London Legal Subject RE Enron Email Goldman SachsJ Aron You asked me to consider whether there would be any advantage to Enron in entering into this agreement given the limitations we discussed yesterday My conclusion is that the agreement would assist Enron in the event of a default by a member of the Goldman Sachs group and there is nothing as a matter of English law at least that would make it imprudent to enter into the agreement The reason why I think the agreement assists Enron is that absent a winding up of a counterparty under English law the courts will generally uphold contractual setoff arrangements There are obvious advantages to having an arrangement under which if one member of the Goldman Sachs group experiences credit problems Enron can close out all its positions at the same time and set them off against each other It is true that if one of the counterparties is subject to English law winding up proceedings the setoff will not be effective because only mutual obligations can be set off against each other and this requires two parties which are acting in the same capacity However this should not affect its validity vis a vis other counterparties and in particular will not affect the enforceability of the netting provisions under the individual master agreements Mutuality is not required outside a winding up where the setoff is based on contract The fact that a counterparty is in administration would not prevent the setoff from being upheld whether as regards that counterparty or any of the others I have obviously just focussed on English law One point I note however is that Section c states that any automatic termination provision in the underlying master agreements is inapplicable This is not a concern as a matter of English law because automatic early termination is not required for the netting arrangements to be enforceable However the position is different in certain other jurisdictions Germany for example The risk is that this provision will affect the underlying netting arrangements as regards counterparties incorporated in those jurisdictions As Paul pointed out yesterday the fact that the multilateral netting arrangements would not be enforceable on an insolvency means that you cannot regard them as creating a net position for regulatory capital purposes although this does not affect the recognition of the netting under each underlying agreement I hope this is helpful If you would like detailed points on the agreement please let me know Original Message From Saxena Rahul mailto

revised to reflect our comments and marked to show changes As we indicated we are interested in pursuing implementing the agreement However we are concerned that the crossaffiliate netting provision may not be enforceable This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the attached markup i we have changed the severability clause to provide that the agreement would survive even if Section is not enforceable and ii we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the operation of crossaffiliate netting Please contact me at the number below or my
