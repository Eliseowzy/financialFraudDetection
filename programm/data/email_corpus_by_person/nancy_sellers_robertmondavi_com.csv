youve already invested in Its the HP difference at eclk Thursday October Circuit Breaker Enron Dumps CFO Amid Conflict Questions By Stephen Taub Enron Corp is set to replace CFO Andrew Fastow As CFOcom reported in a story earlier this week Fastows role in a limited partnership has raised concerns about a conflict of interest Fastow is succeeded by Jeff McMahon who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enrons Industrial Markets group From to McMahon was Enrons treasurer He resigned that post in part because he disapproved of Fastows role in running two partnerships according to The Wall Street Journal In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO said Kenneth L Lay Enron chairman and CEO in a statement McMahon joined Enron in and spent three years in the London office as CFO for the companys European operations Upon returning to the United States McMahon assumed the post of EVP of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp In he was named president and COO of Enron Net Works where he focused on Ecommerce activities As reported on Friday The Wall Street Journal said a limited partnership organized by Fastow who has been Enrons CFO since racked up millions of dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company On Monday Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested information regarding certain related party transactions On October Enron stunned Wall Street when it announced that it would take a billion aftertax charge for the September quarter Since the announcement Enrons share price has more than halved Fastows dismissal seems to be an aboutface for Enron In a conference call Tuesday Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to assure that there was no conflict as Fastow played both roles Enron has since dissolved the partnerships Obviously the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there would be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed certain methods for it to be dealt with so Enron would never be compromised Lay said in published accounts We are very concerned at the way Andys character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles as well as the companys reputation Predictably on Wednesday at least two law firms Stull Stull Brody and Bernstein Liebhard Lifshitz LLP filed classaction suits against Enron Lay Fastow and Jeffrey K Skilling the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August The suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information that materially misstated the companys condition and prospects to the investing public Moreover the suits argue that the company failed to disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not misleading The complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business financial results and operations which failed to disclose among other things The companys Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the companys efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy The companys operating results were materially overstated since Enron failed to write down in a timely fashion the value
