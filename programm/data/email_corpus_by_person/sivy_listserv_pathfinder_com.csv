November The ultimate election play The timely case for Diebold a leading maker of bank ATMs and hightech voting machines Plus the latest nonevents at the Fed and responses to reader comments By Michael Sivy Dimpled and pregnant though they be the hanging chads are swinging once again Now it looks as though the legal terrain is favoring Bush Ive written about the consequences to stocks of a Bush victory see Election correction moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml and Ive considered the implications of a Gore victory see The tech wreck continues moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml I want to appear timely but Im running out of scenarios Nader or Buchanan Thats a bit farfetched Still there may be money to be made on this mess and I cast my vote for Diebold a midcap Ohio company I last recommended Diebold DBD the leading US producer of bank ATM machines in early February when it was trading at a share see Deja vu moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml At the time the company had just come off a string of bad news The Asian financial crisis in had crimped foreign sales and YK fears remember them hurt sales in the second half of Plus all the bank megamergers which resulted in many branch closings cut into domestic business Nevertheless Diebolds earnings have steadily risen and the stock is up to a gain since February Heres the election play Through its Brazilian subsidiary Diebold also makes voting machines In October some million Brazilian voters cast ballots using Diebold terminals which promise speedy accurate results and claim to eliminate confusion the terminals also come in special versions for the physically challenged So when US state and local governments start rushing to upgrade their voting machines who could be better positioned than Diebold With annual earnings growth projected at over the next five years and a yield Diebold trades at times this years estimated earnings and times next years projected results The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee met today to consider changing its interest rate policy The FOMC not only kept rates unchanged it also maintained a tightening bias that means the Fed is still allowing for the possibility of raising interest rates It would do so to fight inflation which remains a threat largely because of the tight labor market with unemployment below and the runup in energy prices But if the economy continues to slow Fedwatchers think the FOMC could go to a neutral stance in December and start cutting rates early next year I have received more email than usual in response to recent columns my thanks to everyone who sends stuff in and Id like to respond to two particularly pointed comments First Id like to clarify my piece from October on stock options see The right way to use stock options I do not advocate options trading for individual investors I think most people should concentrate on stocks bonds and mutual funds and leave options and futures to professional trading desks The nature of the market causes options to be consistently overpriced so it is generally a bad choice to buy options That said there may be an advantage to selling them Typically small investors can do this most safely by selling call options on stocks they already own when that boosts their profit potential But as some readers pointed out you can still lose money on such covered writes if the stock drops enough Second I am not as some readers have suggested a shameless apologist for the Democratic party I think investors should consider the market impact of political developments in as detached a manner as possible I have however enjoyed telling my colleagues that I am viewed online as a crazed liberal Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or

Bad news bulls The news may be rotten for semiconductor stocks but investors are betting on a rebound for leaders like Intel By Michael Sivy Over the past few months Ive been warning readers that the technology sector remains in a broad downtrend that could last well into next year Nonetheless when tech stocks have been beaten down badly enough shares of the strongest companies can rebound even in the face of continuing bad news provided their longterm prospects are good enough Exactly that sort of badnews rebound has occurred for Applied Materials the leading maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment Last week I wrote that the battered stock would remain volatile and could face a further decline of percent to percent But I concluded that the shares were so cheap at that the upside was times as great as the downside That proved true a lot faster than I expected In the five trading days since that column ran the stock has jumped percent to nearly a share Admittedly my good timing was largely luck but the power of Applied Materials comeback is a signal that other leading semiconductor stocks also may have fallen too far As a rule if youre considering stocks in the midst of bad news its smartest to stick with industry giants that have bulletproof balance sheets You can be confident that theyll ride out whatever bad conditions lie ahead and they may even benefit as smaller competitors are forced to give up market share On that basis Id certainly be inclined to look at Intel Though its the worlds leading chipmaker with billion in annual sales Intel has spent the year fouling up Among the more spectacular errors the company ran short of capacity because it underestimated demand last year and cut back capital spending In addition glitches were discovered last summer in Intels turbocharged Pentium III and many of the chips had to be recalled Frankly none of those failures will have much longterm impact Intel remains the industrys pound gorilla and longterm earnings growth is projected at more than percent a year Most analysts see continuing weakness in the chip market for the next six months but see the cycle swinging up by late next year In September Intel warned that thirdquarter earnings would be lousy and the stock fell by to a share At the time I wrote that the stock was down to buyable levels but that it wouldnt rebound right away Over the next three months Intel sank to less than amid a general selloff in technology But after announcing on Friday that fourthquarter results would be disappointing because of soft personalcomputer sales Intel rallied On Monday investors followed through by bidding the stock up another to Investors are clearly betting that the worst is over And with the stock only about percent above its lows and percent off its highs I think it makes sense to get on board After revising their estimates downward analysts expect Intel to earn about a share next year At the current share price thats a PE cheap for a percent core growth rate If Intel is missing from your portfolio this may well be your best opportunity for years to come UPCOMING CHAT Monday December at pm ET pm PT Moneycom presents Third

November The tech wreck continues Election chaos and lousy earnings news from companies such as HewlettPackard are driving down tech stocks But dont rush to buy yet By Michael Sivy There is no constitutional crisis The presidential election results will probably be sorted out within a week and certainly long before the electors cast their votes on Dec Though the outcome of the bitter fight in Florida is anybodys guess it largely depends on technical legal issues the lawyers I know think the chances of Al Gore getting the count he wants are better than The electoral chaos is contributing to a decline in the Dow and an even sharper selloff in the Nasdaq which was down to less than at one point on Monday more than percent off the March high Also a large factor in the selloff was Hewlett Packards thirdquarter bomb Although sales were up almost percent from yearearlier levels earnings came in percent or cents a share below analysts expectations They attribute the profit shortfall partly to the effects of the weak euro but mostly to expenses that were much higher than HP expected It appears that to reach its ambitious sales goals the company let costs get out of hand From a longterm perspective there doesnt seem to be anything seriously wrong with HewlettPackards business With more attention to cost control HPs sales might grow a little bit slower percent annually say but profits would increase just as fast Trading at a share less than times earnings for the coming year a sustainable percent earnings growth rate makes HP look extremely cheap and some analysts rate it a value buy More skeptical analysts however think that HPs decline could continue for a while And thats my bet as well The problem is that the tech group as a whole is in a powerful downtrend In fact the biggest and bestknown tech stocks could be the hardest hit between now and year end Usually money managers and mutual fund executives try to finish their tax selling by the end of October But given the recent uncertainty portfolio managers may continue to cut back on their big tech positions hurting even such tech bluechips as Cisco and Oracle Tech stocks arent the only ones with targets painted on them If Gore does gain the presidency big drug stocks could react quite negatively Even though it will be hard for Gore to do much to hurt the industry given the hostile and divided Congress he would face the drug stocks have been building in a big Bushvictory premium over the past few weeks and the group would therefore be susceptible to a psychologically based selloff The investment that would likely profit most from a Gore victory is fixedincome He would face a Republican Congress at least through and over the next two years the surplus could total more than billion With a sharply divided government the vast bulk of this money would go to paying down the national debt which could be reduced by percent to percent over the twoyear period And even if George W Bush somehow manages to hang on the numbers would be similar Paying down the national debt is wildly bullish for longterm Treasury bonds and would also help the bonds of government agencies like Ginnie Mae and bluechip corporations A shrinking national debt would likely slow the economy even more its the opposite of deficit spending after all That could contribute to a negative climate for growth stocks and encourage the Fed to start lowering interest rates at the first opportunity probably early next year The case for conservatism and diversification has never been greater Post your comments on

goodness Fed chairman Alan Greenspan doesnt have to win in Florida Plus More on Microsoft and John Malones Liberty Media By Michael Sivy It just keeps getting worse Ive listened to explanations on TV of what the absentee ballots could mean and what kinds of litigation are possible Ive read conspiracy theories online about what Jeb Bush did to tilt the election and how electors could switch sides on December Ive heard scenarios on talk radio about how Strom Thurmond could become president and how the dolphins saved Elian so that CubanAmericans would turn out in numbers large enough to put George W over the top I cant bear to listen to any of it anymore Fortunately I dont have to We have a president Come January well have another president Congress will be evenly split And one more thing Alan Greenspan will still be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Thank goodness he doesnt have to be elected in Florida What he does over the next six months will determine how much the economy slows and what kind of stock market well have over the next four years So lets review the facts and the probabilities Whichever candidate becomes president there will be only a moderate tax cut and limited expansion of government spending That will mean that the budget surplus will be bigger than if either candidate had a strong mandate A bigger budget surplus means that the volume of Treasury bonds outstanding will shrink and that will encourage longterm interest rates to fall That will give Greenspan room to cut shortterm interest rates He most likely wont do it at next weeks Fed meeting given the election disarray and the fact that unemployment is still below percent a level thats generally considered inflationary However the economy continues to show signs of slowing core PPI inflation excluding food and energy was actually down last month and it looks as though productivity will be quite strong over the next couple of quarters So look for rate cuts early next year Thats a great environment for bonds and for many stock groups But first we have to get through the current slowdown Tech stocks continue to slide and could get hit even harder during the next six weeks as overextended money managers cut back their tech weightings There are plenty of other cheap stock groups but recognize that some may continue to pull back between now and yearend Keep your eye on the longterm though and youll get some great buys There are however a couple of specific stocks Id consider right now particularly if youre an aggressive investor The first is Liberty Media Group LMGA which I recommended in September at a share see The media master is back moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml The stock price has since fallen to dragged down by the companys intimate connection with ATT This week however Malone said in an interview that he would like to sever ties to ATT Liberty has great assets and could thrive on its own and it looks as though Malone is ready to make a move Id bet on him In addition I think Microsoft is a good buy even though it has rebounded from lows below to I dont pretend to be an expert on computers and I know that Microsofts results for the current quarter could be lame But the reports I see indicate that Windows could start boosting revenues substantially next year And over the next five years Microsoft could turn in earnings growth averaging more than percent annually Those earnings alone should propel the stock and that rapid growth should lead to some multiple expansion as well Moreover as time goes by the governments case against Microsoft becomes moot And the next president is going to be so busy trying to outlaw butterfly ballots he isnt going to have a lot of time to beat up on Bill Gates Post your comments on Michaels

issue of MONEY Click Here scholarship Faceoff on McDonalds Is the worlds numberone fastfood chain really poised for a comeback or is the stock depressed for good reason By Michael Sivy MONEY editoratlarge Ken Kurson and Michael Sivy go headtohead over this columns recommendation of McDonalds see Supersize this Stock moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml On Monday Sivy argued that the stock is a good buy even though it appears beset with problems the economic slowdown in the US fears about madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease that have depressed beef consumption in Europe and the chronically weak euro which reduces the value of McDonalds European profits Sivy believes that these problems will soon pass profit growth will pick up again and the stocks valuation well below historical levels will climb back toward normal Kurson doesnt buy it Their debate follows Kurson This time youve gone too far How can you possibly like anything about McDonalds either the business OR the stock Im assuming you at LEAST detest the food Yes the valuations are cheap next to its own historical averages but NOT against competitors The PEG ratio is by far highest in the group McDonalds PEG is versus for Brinker EAT for CBRL Group CBRL for Darden DRI and a lowly for Tricon YUM despite those endless delicious stuffed crust innovations at Pizza Hut And McDonalds pricesales ratio is more than TWICE any of its competitors And for what A proven ability in the PAST to build faster and a net profit margin thats the envy of the sector But as your column points out overseas is where the opportunity is and also where the problems are You say the problems will pass but I totally disagree Madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease MAY be temporary faddish fashionable concerns I happen to think theyre not so easily dismissed but even conceding that point it doesnt get at the root of MCDs failure to replicate overseas the disgusting and disgustingly profitable empire it has erected here Evidence Japan where MCD is planning a piddling new stores in versus in Thats the companys second biggest market bigger than Europe and there are concerns about profit margins there as well You rightly point out the company relied too heavily on promotional gimmicks But then you give MCD points for totally ridiculous stuff like highend coffee at their McCafes Yeah right Im sure Starbucks is quaking in its boots Just like Pizza Hut was terrified by McPizza Sivy The short response to the points you raise is that I dont really believe in securities analysis Heres the longer version I dont believe that projections of a companys business trends are more reliable than the stocks actual track record and natural statistical tendencies such as regression to the mean If analysts couldnt anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on Ciscos business they cant anticipate anything Fact is McDonalds has proved remarkably resilient over time despite its mediocre products The same arguments you make now have been made before And yet McDonalds has retained its dominant position relative to Tricon and Wendys and other smaller chains When globalization was a hot concept right after the Berlin Wall fell companies with global franchises enjoyed excellent growth Now globaloney is out of fashion and no one is willing to pay up for such franchises that goes for US packaged food companies too At the moment everything is going against McDonalds stock But most of the these trends are cyclical in one way or another The US economy will turn And the McDonalds marketing machine will improve its success rate And sooner or later the stocks multiple will improve Im not looking for the next Dell Computer but I do think that from this price the return on McDonalds will beat a percent hurdle rate As to the current backlash against beef I regard it as a temporary and rather ridiculous expression of deviant psychology Basically the same sorts of people who supported North Vietnam in the s have redirected their selfhatred from the national to the personal level This leads to bodypiercing food phobias and incompetent riots at international freetrade meetings This too shall pass or at least be redirected again to rescuing mink or something Kurson I too place no faith in securities analysts and thus share your suspicion about growthrate projections But I certainly believe in securities analysis and you do too because thats what it is to recommend MCD based upon its history the cyclical nature of the economy the foolhardiness of those who oppose beef These all fit comfortably under the heading of traditional analysis and I dont see any percentage in throwing out all the tools just because a couple of them display the greasy fingerprints of sellside analysts As for your point about past record being more compelling yeah I give a company credit for a track record But only when theres a forwardlooking justification for why that success and higher valuation will continue I mean if a stock costs more than the stock of its peers because the company is doing things differently and is hard to imitate Im willing to afford it some juice But if a stock costs more simply because it always has Im skeptical Especially when things have changed to make previous advantages less impressive as I believe has happened to McDonalds Thats why I cited the sharp falloff of store openings in Japan Any drop in beef consumption may very well be temporary Theres clearly no limit to how fat Americans are willing to become and like a lot of trends were way out in front and I expect the rest of the world to follow suit in time However I DONT think McDonalds will continue to show the dominance in fulfilling that demand or at least continue to do so way better than competitors Sivy Where I differ with you is that I have a far greater skepticism toward all trend projections even though I acknowledge that we have to use them to value stocks Just as economists have predicted of the past seven recessions securities analysts tend to overpredict changes in earnings trends What really changes though is the level of valuations A decade ago everyone loved companies with global brand names Now they ignore those stocks I tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying fundamentals Statistically its most successful to bet on companies with strong track records when theyre off their game and valuations are low thats true even if you cant predict where their next success will come from Post your comments on Michaels column

Michael Sivy As longtime readers of this column know I like to focus mainly on the biggest most financially healthy companies Such bluechip growth stocks are wellfollowed by Wall Street analysts and by the media so their prospects are generally reflected in the share price Occasionally however those stocks get undervalued but they generally return to fair valuations within a few years If you buy them when theyre down odds are youll at least match and probably slightly outpace the general market over a decade or longer For a list of the stocks I think are most worth tracking see the Sivy sivy There are however smart ways to enhance that basic strategy Some investors for example search for socalled special situations stocks that will rise or fall based on unique events like a takeover bid or a corporate restructuring Anticipating such events takes some savvy but there are guideposts that can help One excellent source for those tips is The Superstock Investor a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon published by McGraw Hill Ive known Charlie for more than a decade and hes spotted a lot of great opportunities particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that arent well followed by analysts In fact I featured one of his recommendations in Sivy on Stocks last November United Industrial UIC a small defenserelated company with little debt Since then the stock has risen percent to a share Since every special situation is different the best way to learn about them is to read through a lot of case studies and Charlies book is full of them But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you identify a stock poised for big gains The most important thing to remember is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value Here are potential triggers An outside investor files a D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it has accumulated more than percent of a companys stock A company with one outsider that owns more than percent of the stock attracts other investors who buy big stakes An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder value or expresses an interest in selling its stake A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between a companys management and a major outside shareholder A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback program giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to get the stock price up A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off noncore assets thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge that causes its share price to decline substantially making the stock highly attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake The founder of a company who owns more than percent of the stock passes away removing potential opposition to an acquisition A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting the company in play None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company But if the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds the chance that it will turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To

How now Mad Cow A slowing economy unfavorable exchange rates and new fears about Mad Cow disease are all taking a toll on McDonalds What better reason for a contrarian to buy By Michael Sivy For a decade McDonalds stock set a record high every single year Then in the stock peaked just short of a share and its been downhill ever since McDonalds hit a low of less than in September and the share price has recovered by only since then The global hamburger chain still appears to face a spate of problems but many contrarianminded analysts see a great buying opportunity With outlets in countries McDonalds gets about half its sales and operating profits outside of North America Overall earnings were able to expand at an percent compound annual rate through most of the s because doubledigit growth internationally gave a huge boost to singledigit gains in the United States But the global growth engine began to falter with the Asian financial crisis in Since then overseas results have been penalized by unfavorable exchange rates particularly the weak euro which erodes the value of profits earned in much of Europe This year for instance foreign exchange losses could clip nearly percent from McDonalds net income Recently however an even bigger problem has emerged in Europe the resurgence of Mad Cow disease Various forms of brain disease have long occurred spontaneously in both animals and humans But adding the remnants of slaughtered animals to cattle feed a practice that used to be widespread in the UK appears to have spread some form of the disease more widely in that country Recently however infected cows have also been identified on the Continent leading to fears about the safety of European beef Analysts believe that could lead to a temporary drop in the consumption of McDonalds hamburgers Indeed the companys European sales were off percent in November Its scary but its also hard to believe that there will be any significant damage to McDonalds longterm results The use of animal remains in feed is heavily restricted today and there is little evidence that the practices that promoted Mad Cow were ever significant outside of the UK Moreover because of quality concerns McDonalds has always been highly selective about its suppliers So the beef it buys is likely to conform to the highest local safety standards And to the extent that sales of beef are hurt in continental Europe McDonalds can promote alternative products as it already does in countries where local customs discourage beef consumption Once the Mad Cow scare dies down currency exchange trends should also help the stock After declining in value for nearly two years the euro could rebound by percent or more over the next months according to forecasters McDonalds will open some new outlets this year in the US and the rest in foreign markets And store growth in is projected to be roughly the same Over the next five years earnings per share could rise nearly percent annually The stock which is both a growth favorite and a popular defensive choice suitable now that tech is in trouble has traded at PEs in the mids over the past few years At a current though shares go for less than times next years estimated earnings of at least a share Based on expected earnings growth and a modest PE increase as recent bad news abates analysts see the stock reaching or more

numbers are hard to sort out and some analysts are talking about stagflation The best stocks for this environment include consumer products companies like Procter Gamble By Michael Sivy The most recent economic data all contradict each other First we hear that real gross domestic product grew at a percent annual rate in the first quarter a stunner because just about everyone was expecting growth to be down from the percent rate of the fourth quarter So no need to worry about recession right But then we get employment data that shows payroll numbers tumbling and unemployment up from percent to percent In addition inflation pressures particularly labor costs are moving ominously higher Economists are starting to talk about stagflation the awful combination of inflation and low growth The last time they did that we had an oil crisis and a horrific bear market Dont take any of this too seriously Confusion and economic crosscurrents are normal at this point in the business cycle What were seeing now is the regular churning that occurs as the economy completes a slowdown and struggles to get back on a growth track For investors the key is to isolate the trends that really matter The most important one is that the economy as a whole is still growing Despite lots of scattered bad news we still havent has a single quarter of declining GDP We might get one but its hard to imagine that well get two really bad quarters back to back and thats what defines a recession At worst it looks as though well get what they used to call a growth recession back in the s a drop more or less to zero but not a meaningful decline Thats basically good news for corporate profits Companies can maintain earnings during a brief growth recession by cutting costs And a modest rise in unemployment is also positive for corporate America because it makes jobs easier to fill and restrains labor costs An uptick in unemployment is also likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates The majority of Fedwatchers expect chairman Alan Greenspan to reduce rates at least a quarter percentage point at the next Fed meeting on May The continuing trend toward lower rates will encourage home refinancing which will add another or a month to some household budgets and help keep overall consumer spending healthy What stocks are most timely at this point in the cycle As Ive said before I think that the big money over the next five years will be made on the largest tech stocks Nearer term I think we could see strong performance among defensive consumer stocks the shares of companies that sell everyday products No one is going to stop buying toothpaste or detergent because of a mild economic slowdown And a whiff of inflation is actually good for consumer stocks because it makes it easier to raise product prices One obvious candidate is Procter Gamble PG with brands that include Tide Ivory Head Shoulders and Charmin The stock has dipped since I last recommended it but since April PG has risen percent And I expect that rally to continue PG has a number of big issues The company is in the midst of a restructuring and it could take a while to work through all the kinks In addition PG is bidding to acquire Clairol from BristolMyers Squibb But over the next year PG should emerge from its restructuring as a more focused collection of extremely attractive businesses What matters most now is that the stock is depressed and that sales wont be exposed to any significant economic downturn This past week PG announced a surprisingly solid percent gain in operating profits for the first quarter Much of that was from price increases Still analysts thought the results were encouraging and Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the stock to outperform Fullyear growth this year and next may be only around percent but PGs growth rate could be back above percent by sometime next year Add in a percent yield and youre talking about aboveaverage total return potential At a current price of a share PG is trading at less than times this years estimated earnings Thats pretty cheap and any successful results from the restructuring would just be gravy

been between tech stocks and defensive groups The second has been between issues with high PEs and those with low PEs And the third has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with small caps After many months of leadership tech stocks peaked in March and have declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated Technology companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming quarters and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual investors began reducing their exposure By Thanksgiving even the strongest and most popular tech stocks including Cisco and Oracle were down a third or more from their highs And even at current levels the stocks arent cheap with PEs as high as Theyll be vulnerable to further declines until its clear that the economy has completed its downswing By contrast consumer stocks which are defensive because they arent as tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are benefited from investors flight to safety After having dropped by a third to less than a share in March Procter Gamble PG rebounded percent to And AnheuserBush BUD has rallied more than percent over the same period to Those stocks are now trading at more than times next years earnings so theyre no longer exceptionally cheap But such defensive issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been overloaded in tech Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector but they were helped even more by this years sharp runup in the price of oil ExxonMobil XOM one of the most conservative international oil companies has gained percent since March to a share I doubt however that oil can remain above a barrel for more than a year or two todays high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce demand As a result I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of their gains While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications Fiercely competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further equipment purchases The result is that stocks throughout the sector from service providers like ATT T and WorldCom WCOM to equipment manufacturers like Lucent LU have lost more than half their value since the spring Statistically I think stocks in the group are undervalued by a third but they still may represent dead money for the next six months These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of the roiling market but they arent the only one The largest US companies have average PEs in the mids and the most popular giants have PEs double or nearly triple historical levels By contrast small companies those with market caps of less than billion have average PEs of below From all these crosscurrents two important ideas emerge At any point theres likely to be at least one sector thats deeply undervalued Dont try to predict the turns just buy one or two of the blue chips in the sector that looks cheapest Right now defensive stocks are still in an uptrend but theyre no longer cheap while the techs are still falling their decline isnt over yet You can either buy good tech values and ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out The other important idea is that highPE bluechip growth stocks are way overvalued compared with everything else Of course those are the stocks everyone most wants to own But be smart diversify with a value fund or a fund that holds mid and smallcaps with an average PE below Theyre out there Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks go

contentlplpjspidmonyemy SIVY ON STOCKS from moneycom November Phone glut Lucent continues to suffer Will the stock recover anytime soon And will overcapacity problems in the industry spread to other telecom stocks By Michael Sivy Lucent LU is the Florida of the telecom sector Its big its booming and it cant stop bungling Lucents latest foulup was announced Tuesday The company said it would have to revise down the results reported for the September quarter because of errors in the way sales were recorded Even worse management said it wont be able to provide analysts with reliable earnings guidance for the current quarter The real problem isnt the money thirdquarter earnings will be hit by just about cents a share its the principle of the thing Investors always turn skeptical when a company overstates its prospects only to lower its sights later on And Lucent has been pulling the rug out from under analysts all year Investors get even more nervous when a company mentions accounting mistakes no matter how small or innocent they seem So Lucents most recent announcement sent the stock as low as down more than percent from the start of the year before recovering to Lucents latest troubles raise several questions for investors What are the companys problems What are the implications for the entire telecom sector And what do Lucents recurrent selloffs mean for valueoriented investors in todays market The last question is easiest to answer Were in the middle of a downtrend for technology stocks Companies that disappoint investors will receive little mercy And its very easy to get burned by a stock that appears to have bottomed I feel that particularly keenly since I recommended Lucent in July as a value play at a share after it was already down nearly percent from its alltime high see The shining deptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml As for Lucents problems two are unique to the company itself and both result from its spinoff from ATT in For more than a century Lucent had been able to rely on the Bell System as a captive customer and so the newly independent company failed to keep up with competitors in key areas like optical technology Second Lucent is still reshuffling top management to find a team that can get both the product line and the accounting system in good running order The broader question is what Lucents troubles indicate about the telecom sector Basically the entire sector is suffering from various forms of overcapacity All the telecom companies geared up in one way or another for much more business than has actually materialized The result when supply outruns demand is cutbacks in purchases of capital equipment and falling prices Those shortterm problems can be painful but excess capacity always gets used up and often far faster than analysts expect So I imagine that within a year or two all telecom companies will face a firmer pricing environment and their share prices will rally I believe that investors who want to build a longterm position in technology need to own telecom stocks Its impossible to know when any particular stock will bottom in the short run any telecomrelated stock could go lower and not even the most successful such as Cisco CSCO and Nortel Networks NT are completely safe But stocks like ATT T and WorldCom WCOM as well as Lucent all are trading at least a third below their asset value You have to buy when stocks look undervalued and then hang on without flinching if they go lower The longterm profit potential is there And the best protection is diversification and patience

about todays turbulent market AOL users go to Keyword Live chat From Sivys mailbox Here are my answers to recent emails about tech telecom John Malone and junk bonds By Michael Sivy Ive been receiving a lot of email lately about both the election and the carnage in tech stocks and its hard to say which upsets readers more The one thing that seems fairly certain is that neither is over yet The Florida Supreme Court may force a decision on the election before Thanksgiving or the legal wrangling may continue for several weeks Either way were looking at gridlock in Washington That means the surplus will balloon as increases in government spending and tax cuts are both stymied The swelling surplus could reduce the outstanding volume of Treasury bonds by as much as percent over the next couple of years That would be very bullish for all highquality bonds Treasury agency bluechip corporate and municipal On the other hand using the surplus to reduce debt instead of spending it or returning it to taxpayers who would spend it would sap the economys energy That could mean more earnings disappointments from economically sensitive companies over the next couple of months In the long run though gridlock could lay the foundation for a resumption of the stock market boom Debt reduction and an economic slowdown will probably encourage Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates substantially next year which would be a boon to the overall market Now heres a look at some specific questions Whats up with Cisco and Oracle The Nasdaq has been getting walloped and is now down percent from its highs Ive said that the damage to the tech sector isnt over and that the group may not rally as usual going into the new year Earnings fears are the chief cause of the selloff In addition the most popular tech stocks on the Nasdaq such as Cisco and Oracle carry PEs as high as I imagine that there will be a great buying opportunity for these stocks but they could get cheaper

probably wont rebound quickly If I already owned them Id certainly hold them And Id consider buying now though theres no rush Lucent looks like the most straightforward play followed by WorldCom ATT

moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml and Leader of the free world moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml Since ATT acquired cable TV giant TCI Libertys programming operations have traded as an ATT tracking stock with the symbol LMG class A On some quote systems the symbol is given as LMGa on others as LMGA If you cant find it try the MONEYCOM Website where the stock is LMGA LMGA To my mind the case for Liberty is the case for John Malone He was the master of the industry back when he was CEO of TCI but he nearly disappeared from view after the acquisition Now with the spotlight back on Liberty Malone has the chance to be a player again particularly since ATT has announced that it intends to spin off Liberty as an independent company If the slowing economy is bullish for bonds why is my highyield bond fund down almost percent The slowing economy and the prospect for lower interest rates are extremely bullish for bonds of unquestioned financial strength Junk bonds suffer in an economy slowdown however because investors worry that the companies chances of default will increase If you own a junk mutual fund though Id hang on at this point I have a junk fund too and Im down nearly

November Fix your mix In volatile markets like this one sectors behave in radically different ways Heres what you need to know to find todays best opportunities By Michael Sivy When the economy is purring along most stock groups rise and fall together But amid uncertainty and turmoil different groups suffer at different times and rebound with varying delays Thats whats been happening this year and investors preparing for need to examine each sector independently to find the best bargains and to minimize risk Since January there have been three big divergences in the market The first has been between tech stocks and defensive groups The second has been between issues with high PEs and those with low PEs And the third has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with small caps After many months of leadership tech stocks peaked in March and have declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated Technology companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming quarters and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual investors began reducing their exposure By Thanksgiving even the strongest and most popular tech stocks including Cisco and Oracle were down a third or more from their highs And even at current levels the stocks arent cheap with PEs as high as Theyll be vulnerable to further declines until its clear that the economy has completed its downswing By contrast consumer stocks which are defensive because they arent as tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are benefited from investors flight to safety After having dropped by a third to less than a share in March Procter Gamble PG rebounded percent to And AnheuserBush BUD has rallied more than percent over the same period to Those stocks are now trading at more than times next years earnings so theyre no longer exceptionally cheap But such defensive issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been overloaded in tech Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector but they were helped even more by this years sharp runup in the price of oil ExxonMobil XOM one of the most conservative international oil companies has gained percent since March to a share I doubt however that oil can remain above a barrel for more than a year or two todays high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce demand As a result I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of their gains While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications Fiercely competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further equipment purchases The result is that stocks throughout the sector from service providers like ATT T and WorldCom WCOM to equipment manufacturers like Lucent LU have lost more than half their value since the spring Statistically I think stocks in the group are undervalued by a third but they still may represent dead money for the next six months These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of the roiling market but they arent the only one The largest US companies have average PEs in the mids and the most popular giants have PEs double or nearly triple historical levels By contrast small companies those with market caps of less than billion have average PEs of below From all these crosscurrents two important ideas emerge At any point theres likely to be at least one sector thats deeply undervalued Dont try to predict the turns just buy one or two of the blue chips in the sector that looks cheapest Right now defensive stocks are still in an uptrend but theyre no longer cheap while the techs are still falling their decline isnt over yet You can either buy good tech values and ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out The other important idea is that highPE bluechip growth stocks are way overvalued compared with everything else Of course those are the stocks everyone most wants to own But be smart diversify with a value fund or a fund that holds mid and smallcaps with an average PE below Theyre out there Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks go

Bad news bulls The news may be rotten for semiconductor stocks but investors are betting on a rebound for leaders like Intel By Michael Sivy Over the past few months Ive been warning readers that the technology sector remains in a broad downtrend that could last well into next year Nonetheless when tech stocks have been beaten down badly enough shares of the strongest companies can rebound even in the face of continuing bad news provided their longterm prospects are good enough Exactly that sort of badnews rebound has occurred for Applied Materials the leading maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment Last week I wrote that the battered stock would remain volatile and could face a further decline of percent to percent But I concluded that the shares were so cheap at that the upside was times as great as the downside That proved true a lot faster than I expected In the five trading days since that column ran the stock has jumped percent to nearly a share Admittedly my good timing was largely luck but the power of Applied Materials comeback is a signal that other leading semiconductor stocks also may have fallen too far As a rule if youre considering stocks in the midst of bad news its smartest to stick with industry giants that have bulletproof balance sheets You can be confident that theyll ride out whatever bad conditions lie ahead and they may even benefit as smaller competitors are forced to give up market share On that basis Id certainly be inclined to look at Intel Though its the worlds leading chipmaker with billion in annual sales Intel has spent the year fouling up Among the more spectacular errors the company ran short of capacity because it underestimated demand last year and cut back capital spending In addition glitches were discovered last summer in Intels turbocharged Pentium III and many of the chips had to be recalled Frankly none of those failures will have much longterm impact Intel remains the industrys pound gorilla and longterm earnings growth is projected at more than percent a year Most analysts see continuing weakness in the chip market for the next six months but see the cycle swinging up by late next year In September Intel warned that thirdquarter earnings would be lousy and the stock fell by to a share At the time I wrote that the stock was down to buyable levels but that it wouldnt rebound right away Over the next three months Intel sank to less than amid a general selloff in technology But after announcing on Friday that fourthquarter results would be disappointing because of soft personalcomputer sales Intel rallied On Monday investors followed through by bidding the stock up another to Investors are clearly betting that the worst is over And with the stock only about percent above its lows and percent off its highs I think it makes sense to get on board After revising their estimates downward analysts expect Intel to earn about a share next year At the current share price thats a PE cheap for a percent core growth rate If Intel is missing from your portfolio this may well be your best opportunity for years to come UPCOMING CHAT Monday December at pm ET pm PT Moneycom presents Third

How now Mad Cow A slowing economy unfavorable exchange rates and new fears about Mad Cow disease are all taking a toll on McDonalds What better reason for a contrarian to buy By Michael Sivy For a decade McDonalds stock set a record high every single year Then in the stock peaked just short of a share and its been downhill ever since McDonalds hit a low of less than in September and the share price has recovered by only since then The global hamburger chain still appears to face a spate of problems but many contrarianminded analysts see a great buying opportunity With outlets in countries McDonalds gets about half its sales and operating profits outside of North America Overall earnings were able to expand at an percent compound annual rate through most of the s because doubledigit growth internationally gave a huge boost to singledigit gains in the United States But the global growth engine began to falter with the Asian financial crisis in Since then overseas results have been penalized by unfavorable exchange rates particularly the weak euro which erodes the value of profits earned in much of Europe This year for instance foreign exchange losses could clip nearly percent from McDonalds net income Recently however an even bigger problem has emerged in Europe the resurgence of Mad Cow disease Various forms of brain disease have long occurred spontaneously in both animals and humans But adding the remnants of slaughtered animals to cattle feed a practice that used to be widespread in the UK appears to have spread some form of the disease more widely in that country Recently however infected cows have also been identified on the Continent leading to fears about the safety of European beef Analysts believe that could lead to a temporary drop in the consumption of McDonalds hamburgers Indeed the companys European sales were off percent in November Its scary but its also hard to believe that there will be any significant damage to McDonalds longterm results The use of animal remains in feed is heavily restricted today and there is little evidence that the practices that promoted Mad Cow were ever significant outside of the UK Moreover because of quality concerns McDonalds has always been highly selective about its suppliers So the beef it buys is likely to conform to the highest local safety standards And to the extent that sales of beef are hurt in continental Europe McDonalds can promote alternative products as it already does in countries where local customs discourage beef consumption Once the Mad Cow scare dies down currency exchange trends should also help the stock After declining in value for nearly two years the euro could rebound by percent or more over the next months according to forecasters McDonalds will open some new outlets this year in the US and the rest in foreign markets And store growth in is projected to be roughly the same Over the next five years earnings per share could rise nearly percent

numbers are hard to sort out and some analysts are talking about stagflation The best stocks for this environment include consumer products companies like Procter Gamble By Michael Sivy The most recent economic data all contradict each other First we hear that real gross domestic product grew at a percent annual rate in the first quarter a stunner because just about everyone was expecting growth to be down from the percent rate of the fourth quarter So no need to worry about recession right But then we get employment data that shows payroll numbers tumbling and unemployment up from percent to percent In addition inflation pressures particularly labor costs are moving ominously higher Economists are starting to talk about stagflation the awful combination of inflation and low growth The last time they did that we had an oil crisis and a horrific bear market Dont take any of this too seriously Confusion and economic crosscurrents are normal at this point in the business cycle What were seeing now is the regular churning that occurs as the economy completes a slowdown and struggles to get back on a growth track For investors the key is to isolate the trends that really matter The most important one is that the economy as a whole is still growing Despite lots of scattered bad news we still havent has a single quarter of declining GDP We might get one but its hard to imagine that well get two really bad quarters back to back and thats what defines a recession At worst it looks as though well get what they used to call a growth recession back in the s a drop more or less to zero but not a meaningful decline Thats basically good news for corporate profits Companies can maintain earnings during a brief growth recession by cutting costs And a modest rise in unemployment is also positive for corporate America because it makes jobs easier to fill and restrains labor costs An uptick in unemployment is also likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates The majority of Fedwatchers expect chairman Alan Greenspan to reduce rates at least a quarter percentage point at the next Fed meeting on May The continuing trend toward lower rates will encourage home refinancing which will add another or a month to some household budgets and help keep overall consumer spending healthy What stocks are most timely at this point in the cycle As Ive said before I think that the big money over the next five years will be made on the largest tech stocks Nearer term I think we could see strong performance among defensive consumer stocks the shares of companies that sell everyday products No one is going to stop buying toothpaste or detergent because of a mild economic slowdown And a whiff of inflation is actually good for consumer stocks because it makes it easier to raise product prices One obvious candidate is Procter Gamble PG with brands that include Tide Ivory Head Shoulders and Charmin The stock has dipped since I last recommended it but since April PG has risen percent And I expect that rally to continue PG has a number of big issues The company is in the midst of a restructuring and it could take a while to work through all the kinks In addition PG is bidding to acquire Clairol from BristolMyers Squibb But over the next year PG should emerge from its restructuring as a more focused collection of extremely attractive businesses What matters most now is that the stock is depressed and that sales wont be exposed to any significant economic downturn This past week PG announced a surprisingly solid percent gain in operating profits for the first quarter Much of that was from price increases Still analysts thought the results were encouraging and Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the stock to outperform Fullyear growth this year and next may be only around percent but PGs growth rate could be back above percent by sometime next year Add in a percent yield and youre talking about aboveaverage total return potential At a current price of a share PG is trading at less than times this years estimated earnings Thats pretty cheap and any successful results from the restructuring would just be gravy

of MONEY Click Here scholarship Special situations These tips for identifying investment opportunities will help you find stocks that can move up even when the stock market is flat on its back By Michael Sivy As longtime readers of this column know I like to focus mainly on the biggest most financially healthy companies Such bluechip growth stocks are wellfollowed by Wall Street analysts and by the media so their prospects are generally reflected in the share price Occasionally however those stocks get undervalued but they generally return to fair valuations within a few years If you buy them when theyre down odds are youll at least match and probably slightly outpace the general market over a decade or longer For a list of the stocks I think are most worth tracking see the Sivy sivy There are however smart ways to enhance that basic strategy Some investors for example search for socalled special situations stocks that will rise or fall based on unique events like a takeover bid or a corporate restructuring Anticipating such events takes some savvy but there are guideposts that can help One excellent source for those tips is The Superstock Investor a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon published by McGraw Hill Ive known Charlie for more than a decade and hes spotted a lot of great opportunities particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that arent well followed by analysts In fact I featured one of his recommendations in Sivy on Stocks last November United Industrial UIC a small defenserelated company with little debt Since then the stock has risen percent to a share Since every special situation is different the best way to learn about them is to read through a lot of case studies and Charlies book is full of them But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you identify a stock poised for big gains The most important thing to remember is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value Here are potential triggers An outside investor files a D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it has accumulated more than percent of a companys stock A company with one outsider that owns more than percent of the stock attracts other investors who buy big stakes An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder value or expresses an interest in selling its stake A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between a companys management and a major outside shareholder A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback program giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to get the stock price up A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off noncore assets thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge that causes its share price to decline substantially making the stock highly attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake The founder of a company who owns more than percent of the stock passes away removing potential opposition to an acquisition A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting the company in play None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company But if the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds the chance that it will turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To

issue of MONEY Click Here scholarship Faceoff on McDonalds Is the worlds numberone fastfood chain really poised for a comeback or is the stock depressed for good reason By Michael Sivy MONEY editoratlarge Ken Kurson and Michael Sivy go headtohead over this columns recommendation of McDonalds see Supersize this Stock moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml On Monday Sivy argued that the stock is a good buy even though it appears beset with problems the economic slowdown in the US fears about madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease that have depressed beef consumption in Europe and the chronically weak euro which reduces the value of McDonalds European profits Sivy believes that these problems will soon pass profit growth will pick up again and the stocks valuation well below historical levels will climb back toward normal Kurson doesnt buy it Their debate follows Kurson This time youve gone too far How can you possibly like anything about McDonalds either the business OR the stock Im assuming you at LEAST detest the food Yes the valuations are cheap next to its own historical averages but NOT against competitors The PEG ratio is by far highest in the group McDonalds PEG is versus for Brinker EAT for CBRL Group CBRL for Darden DRI and a lowly for Tricon YUM despite those endless delicious stuffed crust innovations at Pizza Hut And McDonalds pricesales ratio is more than TWICE any of its competitors And for what A proven ability in the PAST to build faster and a net profit margin thats the envy of the sector But as your column points out overseas is where the opportunity is and also where the problems are You say the problems will pass but I totally disagree Madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease MAY be temporary faddish fashionable concerns I happen to think theyre not so easily dismissed but even conceding that point it doesnt get at the root of MCDs failure to replicate overseas the disgusting and disgustingly profitable empire it has erected here Evidence Japan where MCD is planning a piddling new stores in versus in Thats the companys second biggest market bigger than Europe and there are concerns about profit margins there as well You rightly point out the company relied too heavily on promotional gimmicks But then you give MCD points for totally ridiculous stuff like highend coffee at their McCafes Yeah right Im sure Starbucks is quaking in its boots Just like Pizza Hut was terrified by McPizza Sivy The short response to the points you raise is that I dont really believe in securities analysis Heres the longer version I dont believe that projections of a companys business trends are more reliable than the stocks actual track record and natural statistical tendencies such as regression to the mean If analysts couldnt anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on Ciscos business they cant anticipate anything Fact is McDonalds has proved remarkably resilient over time despite its mediocre products The same arguments you make now have been made before And yet McDonalds has retained its dominant position relative to Tricon and Wendys and other smaller chains When globalization was a hot concept right after the Berlin Wall fell companies with global franchises enjoyed excellent growth Now globaloney is out of fashion and no one is willing to pay up for such franchises that goes for US packaged food companies too At the moment everything is going against McDonalds stock But most of the these trends are cyclical in one way or another The US economy will turn And the McDonalds marketing machine will improve its success rate And sooner or later the stocks multiple will improve Im not looking for the next Dell Computer but I do think that from this price the return on McDonalds will beat a percent hurdle rate As to the current backlash against beef I regard it as a temporary and rather ridiculous expression of deviant psychology Basically the same sorts of people who supported North Vietnam in the s have redirected their selfhatred from the national to the personal level This leads to bodypiercing food phobias and incompetent riots at international freetrade meetings This too shall pass or at least be redirected again to rescuing mink or something Kurson I too place no faith in securities analysts and thus share your suspicion about growthrate projections But I certainly believe in securities analysis and you do too because thats what it is to recommend MCD based upon its history the cyclical nature of the economy the foolhardiness of those who oppose beef These all fit comfortably under the heading of traditional analysis and I dont see any percentage in throwing out all the tools just because a couple of them display the greasy fingerprints of sellside analysts As for your point about past record being more compelling yeah I give a company credit for a track record But only when theres a forwardlooking justification for why that success and higher valuation will continue I mean if a stock costs more than the stock of its peers because the company is doing things differently and is hard to imitate Im willing to afford it some juice But if a stock costs more simply because it always has Im skeptical Especially when things have changed to make previous advantages less impressive as I believe has happened to McDonalds Thats why I cited the sharp falloff of store openings in Japan Any drop in beef consumption may very well be temporary Theres clearly no limit to how fat Americans are willing to become and like a lot of trends were way out in front and I expect the rest of the world to follow suit in time However I DONT think McDonalds will continue to show the dominance in fulfilling that demand or at least continue to do so way better than competitors Sivy Where I differ with you is that I have a far greater skepticism toward all trend projections even though I acknowledge that we have to use them to value stocks Just as economists have predicted of the past seven recessions securities analysts tend to overpredict changes in earnings trends What really changes though is the level of valuations A decade ago everyone loved companies with global brand names Now they ignore those stocks I tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying fundamentals Statistically its most successful to bet on companies with strong track records when theyre off their game and valuations are low thats true even if you cant predict where their next success will come from Post your comments on Michaels column

goodness Fed chairman Alan Greenspan doesnt have to win in Florida Plus More on Microsoft and John Malones Liberty Media By Michael Sivy It just keeps getting worse Ive listened to explanations on TV of what the absentee ballots could mean and what kinds of litigation are possible Ive read conspiracy theories online about what Jeb Bush did to tilt the election and how electors could switch sides on December Ive heard scenarios on talk radio about how Strom Thurmond could become president and how the dolphins saved Elian so that CubanAmericans would turn out in numbers large enough to put George W over the top I cant bear to listen to any of it anymore Fortunately I dont have to We have a president Come January well have another president Congress will be evenly split And one more thing Alan Greenspan will still be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Thank goodness he doesnt have to be elected in Florida What he does over the next six months will determine how much the economy slows and what kind of stock market well have over the next four years So lets review the facts and the probabilities Whichever candidate becomes president there will be only a moderate tax cut and limited expansion of government spending That will mean that the budget surplus will be bigger than if either candidate had a strong mandate A bigger budget surplus means that the volume of Treasury bonds outstanding will shrink and that will encourage longterm interest rates to fall That will give Greenspan room to cut shortterm interest rates He most likely wont do it at next weeks Fed meeting given the election disarray and the fact that unemployment is still below percent a level thats generally considered inflationary However the economy continues to show signs of slowing core PPI inflation excluding food and energy was actually down last month and it looks as though productivity will be quite strong over the next couple of quarters So look for rate cuts early next year Thats a great environment for bonds and for many stock groups But first we have to get through the current slowdown Tech stocks continue to slide and could get hit even harder during the next six weeks as overextended money managers cut back their tech weightings There are plenty of other cheap stock groups but recognize that some may continue to pull back between now and yearend Keep your eye on the longterm though and youll get some great buys There are however a couple of specific stocks Id consider right now particularly if youre an aggressive investor The first is Liberty Media Group LMGA which I recommended in September at a share see The media master is back moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml The stock price has since fallen to dragged down by the companys intimate connection with ATT This week however Malone said in an interview that he would like to sever ties to ATT Liberty has great assets and could thrive on its own and it looks as though Malone is ready to make a move Id bet on him In addition I think Microsoft is a good buy even though it has rebounded from lows below to I dont pretend to be an expert on computers and I know that Microsofts results for the current quarter could be lame But the reports I see indicate that Windows could start boosting revenues substantially next year And over the next five years Microsoft could turn in earnings growth averaging more than percent annually Those earnings alone should propel the stock and that rapid growth should lead to some multiple expansion as well Moreover as time goes by the governments case against Microsoft becomes moot And the next president is going to be so busy trying to outlaw butterfly ballots he isnt going to have a lot of time to beat up on Bill Gates Post your comments on Michaels

November The tech wreck continues Election chaos and lousy earnings news from companies such as HewlettPackard are driving down tech stocks But dont rush to buy yet By Michael Sivy There is no constitutional crisis The presidential election results will probably be sorted out within a week and certainly long before the electors cast their votes on Dec Though the outcome of the bitter fight in Florida is anybodys guess it largely depends on technical legal issues the lawyers I know think the chances of Al Gore getting the count he wants are better than The electoral chaos is contributing to a decline in the Dow and an even sharper selloff in the Nasdaq which was down to less than at one point on Monday more than percent off the March high Also a large factor in the selloff was Hewlett Packards thirdquarter bomb Although sales were up almost percent from yearearlier levels earnings came in percent or cents a share below analysts expectations They attribute the profit shortfall partly to the effects of the weak euro but mostly to expenses that were much higher than HP expected It appears that to reach its ambitious sales goals the company let costs get out of hand From a longterm perspective there doesnt seem to be anything seriously wrong with HewlettPackards business With more attention to cost control HPs sales might grow a little bit slower percent annually say but profits would increase just as fast Trading at a share less than times earnings for the coming year a sustainable percent earnings growth rate makes HP look extremely cheap and some analysts rate it a value buy More skeptical analysts however think that HPs decline could continue for a while And thats my bet as well The problem is that the tech group as a whole is in a powerful downtrend In fact the biggest and bestknown tech stocks could be the hardest hit between now and year end Usually money managers and mutual fund executives try to finish their tax selling by the end of October But given the recent uncertainty portfolio managers may continue to cut back on their big tech positions hurting even such tech bluechips as Cisco and Oracle Tech stocks arent the only ones with targets painted on them If Gore does gain the presidency big drug stocks could react quite negatively Even though it will be hard for Gore to do much to hurt the industry given the hostile and divided Congress he would face the drug stocks have been building in a big Bushvictory premium over the past few weeks and the group would therefore be susceptible to a psychologically based selloff The investment that would likely profit most from a Gore victory is fixedincome He would face a Republican Congress at least through and over the next two years the surplus could total more than billion With a sharply divided government the vast bulk of this money would go to paying down the national debt which could be reduced by percent to percent over the twoyear period And even if George W Bush somehow manages to hang on the numbers would be similar Paying down the national debt is wildly bullish for longterm Treasury bonds and would also help the bonds of government agencies like Ginnie Mae and bluechip corporations A shrinking national debt would likely slow the economy even more its the opposite of deficit spending after all That could contribute to a negative climate for growth stocks and encourage the Fed to start lowering interest rates at the first opportunity probably early next year The case for conservatism and diversification has never been greater Post your comments on

come off a string of bad news The Asian financial crisis in had crimped foreign sales and YK fears remember them hurt sales in the second half of Plus all the bank megamergers which resulted in many

Diebold also makes voting machines In October some million Brazilian voters cast ballots using Diebold terminals which promise speedy accurate results and claim to eliminate confusion the terminals also come in special versions for the physically challenged So when US state and local governments start rushing to upgrade their voting machines who could be better positioned than Diebold With annual earnings growth projected at over the next five years and a yield Diebold trades at times this years estimated earnings and times next years projected results The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee met today to consider changing its interest rate policy The FOMC not only kept rates unchanged it also maintained a tightening bias that means the Fed is still allowing for the possibility

appear timely but Im running out of scenarios Nader or Buchanan Thats a bit farfetched Still there may be money to be made on this mess and I cast my vote for Diebold a midcap Ohio company I last recommended Diebold DBD the leading US producer of bank ATM machines in early February when it was trading at a share see Deja vu moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml At the time the company had just come off a string of bad news The Asian financial crisis in had crimped foreign sales and YK fears remember them hurt sales in the second half of Plus all the bank megamergers which resulted in many branch closings cut into domestic business Nevertheless Diebolds earnings have steadily risen and the stock is up to a gain since February Heres the election play Through its Brazilian subsidiary Diebold also makes voting machines In October some million Brazilian voters cast ballots using Diebold terminals which promise speedy accurate results and claim to eliminate confusion the terminals also come in special versions for the physically challenged So when US state and local governments start rushing to upgrade their voting machines who could be better positioned than Diebold With annual earnings growth projected at over the next five years and a yield Diebold trades at times this years estimated earnings and times next years projected results The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee met today to consider changing its interest rate policy The FOMC not only kept rates unchanged it also maintained a tightening bias that means the Fed is still allowing for the possibility

Bad news bulls The news may be rotten for semiconductor stocks but investors are betting on a rebound for leaders like Intel By Michael Sivy Over the past few months Ive been warning readers that the technology sector remains in a broad downtrend that could last well into next year Nonetheless when tech stocks have been beaten down badly enough shares of the strongest companies can rebound even in the face of continuing bad news provided their longterm prospects are good enough Exactly that sort of badnews rebound has occurred for Applied Materials the leading maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment Last week I wrote that the battered stock would remain volatile and could face a further decline of percent to percent But I concluded that the shares were so cheap at that the upside was times as great as the downside That proved true a lot faster than I expected In the five trading days since that column ran the stock has jumped percent to nearly a share Admittedly my good timing was largely luck but the power of Applied Materials comeback is a signal that other leading semiconductor stocks also may have fallen too far As a rule if youre considering stocks in the midst of bad news its smartest to stick with industry giants that have bulletproof balance sheets You can be confident that theyll ride out whatever bad conditions lie ahead and they may even benefit as smaller competitors are forced to give up market share On that basis Id certainly be inclined to look at Intel Though its the worlds leading chipmaker with billion in annual sales Intel has spent the year fouling up Among the more spectacular errors the company ran short of capacity because it underestimated demand last year and cut back capital spending In addition glitches were discovered last summer in Intels turbocharged Pentium III and many of the chips had to be recalled Frankly none of those failures will have much longterm impact Intel remains the industrys pound gorilla and longterm earnings growth is projected at more than percent a year Most analysts see continuing weakness in the chip market for the next six months but see the cycle swinging up by late next year In September Intel warned that thirdquarter earnings would be lousy and the stock fell by to a share At the time I wrote that the stock was down to buyable levels but that it wouldnt rebound right away Over the next three months Intel sank to less than amid a general selloff in technology But after announcing on Friday that fourthquarter results would be disappointing because of soft personalcomputer sales Intel rallied On Monday investors followed through by bidding the stock up another to Investors are clearly betting that the worst is over And with the stock only about percent above its lows and percent off its highs I think it makes sense to get on board After revising their estimates downward analysts expect Intel to earn about a share next year At the current share price thats a PE cheap for a percent core growth rate If Intel is missing from your portfolio this may well be your best opportunity for years to come UPCOMING CHAT Monday December at pm ET pm PT Moneycom presents Third

The tech wreck continues Election chaos and lousy earnings news from companies such as HewlettPackard are driving down tech stocks But dont rush to buy yet By Michael Sivy There is no constitutional crisis The presidential election results will probably be sorted out within a week and certainly long before the electors cast their votes on Dec Though the outcome of the bitter fight in Florida is anybodys guess it largely depends on technical legal issues the lawyers I know think the chances of Al Gore getting the count he wants are better than The electoral chaos is contributing to a decline in the Dow and an even sharper selloff in the Nasdaq which was down to less than at one point on Monday more than percent off the March high Also a large factor in the selloff was Hewlett Packards thirdquarter bomb Although sales were up almost percent from yearearlier levels earnings came in percent or cents a share below analysts expectations They attribute the profit shortfall partly to the effects of the weak euro but mostly to expenses that were much higher than HP expected It appears that to reach its ambitious sales goals the company let costs get out of hand From a longterm perspective there doesnt seem to be anything seriously wrong with HewlettPackards business With more attention to cost control HPs sales might grow a little bit slower percent annually say but profits would increase just as fast Trading at a share less than times earnings for the coming year a sustainable percent earnings growth rate makes HP look extremely cheap and some analysts rate it a value buy More skeptical analysts however think that HPs decline could continue for a while And thats my bet as well The problem is that the tech group as a whole is in a powerful downtrend In fact the biggest and bestknown tech stocks could be the hardest hit between now and year end Usually money managers and mutual fund executives try to finish their tax selling by the end of October But given the recent uncertainty portfolio managers may continue to cut back on their big tech positions hurting even such tech bluechips as Cisco and Oracle Tech stocks arent the only ones with targets painted on them If Gore does gain the presidency big drug stocks could react quite negatively Even though it will be hard for Gore to do much to hurt the industry given the hostile and divided Congress he would face the drug stocks have been building in a big Bushvictory premium over the past few weeks and the group would therefore be susceptible to a psychologically based selloff The investment that would likely profit most from a Gore victory is fixedincome He would face a Republican Congress at least through and over the next two years the surplus could total more than billion With a sharply divided government the vast bulk of this money would go to paying down the national debt which could be reduced by percent to percent over the twoyear period And even if George W Bush somehow manages to hang on the numbers would be similar Paying down the national debt is wildly bullish for longterm Treasury bonds and would also help the bonds of government agencies like Ginnie Mae and bluechip corporations A shrinking national debt would likely slow the economy even more its the opposite of deficit spending after all That could contribute to a negative climate for growth stocks and encourage the Fed to start lowering interest rates at the first opportunity probably early next year The case for conservatism and diversification has never been greater Post your comments on Michaels

goodness Fed chairman Alan Greenspan doesnt have to win in Florida Plus More on Microsoft and John Malones Liberty Media By Michael Sivy It just keeps getting worse Ive listened to explanations on TV of what the absentee ballots could mean and what kinds of litigation are possible Ive read conspiracy theories online about what Jeb Bush did to tilt the election and how electors could switch sides on December Ive heard scenarios on talk radio about how Strom Thurmond could become president and how the dolphins saved Elian so that CubanAmericans would turn out in numbers large enough to put George W over the top I cant bear to listen to any of it anymore Fortunately I dont have to We have a president Come January well have another president Congress will be evenly split And one more thing Alan Greenspan will still be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Thank goodness he doesnt have to be elected in Florida What he does over the next six months will determine how much the economy slows and what kind of stock market well have over the next four years So lets review the facts and the probabilities Whichever candidate becomes president there will be only a moderate tax cut and limited expansion of government spending That will mean that the budget surplus will be bigger than if either candidate had a strong mandate A bigger budget surplus means that the volume of Treasury bonds outstanding will shrink and that will encourage longterm interest rates to fall That will give Greenspan room to cut shortterm interest rates He most likely wont do it at next weeks Fed meeting given the election disarray and the fact that unemployment is still below percent a level thats generally considered inflationary However the economy continues to show signs of slowing core PPI inflation excluding food and energy was actually down last month and it looks as though productivity will be quite strong over the next couple of quarters So look for rate cuts early next year Thats a great environment for bonds and for many stock groups But first we have to get through the current slowdown Tech stocks continue to slide and could get hit even harder during the next six weeks as overextended money managers cut back their tech weightings There are plenty of other cheap stock groups but recognize that some may continue to pull back between now and yearend Keep your eye on the longterm though and youll get some great buys There are however a couple of specific stocks Id consider right now particularly if youre an aggressive investor The first is Liberty Media Group LMGA which I recommended in September at a share see The media master is back moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml The stock price has since fallen to dragged down by the companys intimate connection with ATT This week however Malone said in an interview that he would like to sever ties to ATT Liberty has great assets and could thrive on its own and it looks as though Malone is ready to make a move Id bet on him In addition I think Microsoft is a good buy even though it has rebounded from lows below to I dont pretend to be an expert on computers and I know that Microsofts results for the current quarter could be lame But the reports I see indicate that Windows could start boosting revenues substantially next year And over the next five years Microsoft could turn in earnings growth averaging more than percent annually Those earnings alone should propel the stock and that rapid growth should lead to some multiple expansion as well Moreover as time goes by the governments case against Microsoft becomes moot And the next president is going to be so busy trying to outlaw butterfly ballots he isnt going to have a lot of time to beat up on Bill Gates Post your comments on Michaels

issue of MONEY Click Here scholarship Faceoff on McDonalds Is the worlds numberone fastfood chain really poised for a comeback or is the stock depressed for good reason By Michael Sivy MONEY editoratlarge Ken Kurson and Michael Sivy go headtohead over this columns recommendation of McDonalds see Supersize this Stock moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml On Monday Sivy argued that the stock is a good buy even though it appears beset with problems the economic slowdown in the US fears about madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease that have depressed beef consumption in Europe and the chronically weak euro which reduces the value of McDonalds European profits Sivy believes that these problems will soon pass profit growth will pick up again and the stocks valuation well below historical levels will climb back toward normal Kurson doesnt buy it Their debate follows Kurson This time youve gone too far How can you possibly like anything about McDonalds either the business OR the stock Im assuming you at LEAST detest the food Yes the valuations are cheap next to its own historical averages but NOT against competitors The PEG ratio is by far highest in the group McDonalds PEG is versus for Brinker EAT for CBRL Group CBRL for Darden DRI and a lowly for Tricon YUM despite those endless delicious stuffed crust innovations at Pizza Hut And McDonalds pricesales ratio is more than TWICE any of its competitors And for what A proven ability in the PAST to build faster and a net profit margin thats the envy of the sector But as your column points out overseas is where the opportunity is and also where the problems are You say the problems will pass but I totally disagree Madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease MAY be temporary faddish fashionable concerns I happen to think theyre not so easily dismissed but even conceding that point it doesnt get at the root of MCDs failure to replicate overseas the disgusting and disgustingly profitable empire it has erected here Evidence Japan where MCD is planning a piddling new stores in versus in Thats the companys second biggest market bigger than Europe and there are concerns about profit margins there as well You rightly point out the company relied too heavily on promotional gimmicks But then you give MCD points for totally ridiculous stuff like highend coffee at their McCafes Yeah right Im sure Starbucks is quaking in its boots Just like Pizza Hut was terrified by McPizza Sivy The short response to the points you raise is that I dont really believe in securities analysis Heres the longer version I dont believe that projections of a companys business trends are more reliable than the stocks actual track record and natural statistical tendencies such as regression to the mean If analysts couldnt anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on Ciscos business they cant anticipate anything Fact is McDonalds has proved remarkably resilient over time despite its mediocre products The same arguments you make now have been made before And yet McDonalds has retained its dominant position relative to Tricon and Wendys and other smaller chains When globalization was a hot concept right after the Berlin Wall fell companies with global franchises enjoyed excellent growth Now globaloney is out of fashion and no one is willing to pay up for such franchises that goes for US packaged food companies too At the moment everything is going against McDonalds stock But most of the these trends are cyclical in one way or another The US economy will turn And the McDonalds marketing machine will improve its success rate And sooner or later the stocks multiple will improve Im not looking for the next Dell Computer but I do think that from this price the return on McDonalds will beat a percent hurdle rate As to the current backlash against beef I regard it as a temporary and rather ridiculous expression of deviant psychology Basically the same sorts of people who supported North Vietnam in the s have redirected their selfhatred from the national to the personal level This leads to bodypiercing food phobias and incompetent riots at international freetrade meetings This too shall pass or at least be redirected again to rescuing mink or something Kurson I too place no faith in securities analysts and thus share your suspicion about growthrate projections But I certainly believe in securities analysis and you do too because thats what it is to recommend MCD based upon its history the cyclical nature of the economy the foolhardiness of those who oppose beef These all fit comfortably under the heading of traditional analysis and I dont see any percentage in throwing out all the tools just because a couple of them display the greasy fingerprints of sellside analysts As for your point about past record being more compelling yeah I give a company credit for a track record But only when theres a forwardlooking justification for why that success and higher valuation will continue I mean if a stock costs more than the stock of its peers because the company is doing things differently and is hard to imitate Im willing to afford it some juice But if a stock costs more simply because it always has Im skeptical Especially when things have changed to make previous advantages less impressive as I believe has happened to McDonalds Thats why I cited the sharp falloff of store openings in Japan Any drop in beef consumption may very well be temporary Theres clearly no limit to how fat Americans are willing to become and like a lot of trends were way out in front and I expect the rest of the world to follow suit in time However I DONT think McDonalds will continue to show the dominance in fulfilling that demand or at least continue to do so way better than competitors Sivy Where I differ with you is that I have a far greater skepticism toward all trend projections even though I acknowledge that we have to use them to value stocks Just as economists have predicted of the past seven recessions securities analysts tend to overpredict changes in earnings trends What really changes though is the level of valuations A decade ago everyone loved companies with global brand names Now they ignore those stocks I tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying fundamentals Statistically its most successful to bet on companies with strong track records when theyre off their game and valuations are low thats true even if you cant predict where their next success will come from Post your comments on Michaels column

Michael Sivy As longtime readers of this column know I like to focus mainly on the biggest most financially healthy companies Such bluechip growth stocks are wellfollowed by Wall Street analysts and by the media so their prospects are generally reflected in the share price Occasionally however those stocks get undervalued but they generally return to fair valuations within a few years If you buy them when theyre down odds are youll at least match and probably slightly outpace the general market over a decade or longer For a list of the stocks I think are most worth tracking see the Sivy sivy There are however smart ways to enhance that basic strategy Some investors for example search for socalled special situations stocks that will rise or fall based on unique events like a takeover bid or a corporate restructuring Anticipating such events takes some savvy but there are guideposts that can help One excellent source for those tips is The Superstock Investor a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon published by McGraw Hill Ive known Charlie for more than a decade and hes spotted a lot of great opportunities particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that arent well followed by analysts In fact I featured one of his recommendations in Sivy on Stocks last November United Industrial UIC a small defenserelated company with little debt Since then the stock has risen percent to a share Since every special situation is different the best way to learn about them is to read through a lot of case studies and Charlies book is full of them But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you identify a stock poised for big gains The most important thing to remember is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value Here are potential triggers An outside investor files a D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it has accumulated more than percent of a companys stock A company with one outsider that owns more than percent of the stock attracts other investors who buy big stakes An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder value or expresses an interest in selling its stake A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between a companys management and a major outside shareholder A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback program giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to get the stock price up A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off noncore assets thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge that causes its share price to decline substantially making the stock highly attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake The founder of a company who owns more than percent of the stock passes away removing potential opposition to an acquisition A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting the company in play None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company But if the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds the chance that it will turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To

numbers are hard to sort out and some analysts are talking about stagflation The best stocks for this environment include consumer products companies like Procter Gamble By Michael Sivy The most recent economic data all contradict each other First we hear that real gross domestic product grew at a percent annual rate in the first quarter a stunner because just about everyone was expecting growth to be down from the percent rate of the fourth quarter So no need to worry about recession right But then we get employment data that shows payroll numbers tumbling and unemployment up from percent to percent In addition inflation pressures particularly labor costs are moving ominously higher Economists are starting to talk about stagflation the awful combination of inflation and low growth The last time they did that we had an oil crisis and a horrific bear market Dont take any of this too seriously Confusion and economic crosscurrents are normal at this point in the business cycle What were seeing now is the regular churning that occurs as the economy completes a slowdown and struggles to get back on a growth track For investors the key is to isolate the trends that really matter The most important one is that the economy as a whole is still growing Despite lots of scattered bad news we still havent has a single quarter of declining GDP We might get one but its hard to imagine that well get two really bad quarters back to back and thats what defines a recession At worst it looks as though well get what they used to call a growth recession back in the s a drop more or less to zero but not a meaningful decline Thats basically good news for corporate profits Companies can maintain earnings during a brief growth recession by cutting costs And a modest rise in unemployment is also positive for corporate America because it makes jobs easier to fill and restrains labor costs An uptick in unemployment is also likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates The majority of Fedwatchers expect chairman Alan Greenspan to reduce rates at least a quarter percentage point at the next Fed meeting on May The continuing trend toward lower rates will encourage home refinancing which will add another or a month to some household budgets and help keep overall consumer spending healthy What stocks are most timely at this point in the cycle As Ive said before I think that the big money over the next five years will be made on the largest tech stocks Nearer term I think we could see strong performance among defensive consumer stocks the shares of companies that sell everyday products No one is going to stop buying toothpaste or detergent because of a mild economic slowdown And a whiff of inflation is actually good for consumer stocks because it makes it easier to raise product prices One obvious candidate is Procter Gamble PG with brands that include Tide Ivory Head Shoulders and Charmin The stock has dipped since I last recommended it but since April PG has risen percent And I expect that rally to continue PG has a number of big issues The company is in the midst of a restructuring and it could take a while to work through all the kinks In addition PG is bidding to acquire Clairol from BristolMyers Squibb But over the next year PG should emerge from its restructuring as a more focused collection of extremely attractive businesses What matters most now is that the stock is depressed and that sales wont be exposed to any significant economic downturn This past week PG announced a surprisingly solid percent gain in operating profits for the first quarter Much of that was from price increases Still analysts thought the results were encouraging and Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the stock to outperform Fullyear growth this year and next may be only around percent but PGs growth rate could be back above percent by sometime next year Add in a percent yield and youre talking about aboveaverage total return potential At a current price of a share PG is trading at less than times this years estimated earnings Thats pretty cheap and any successful results from the restructuring would just be gravy

How now Mad Cow A slowing economy unfavorable exchange rates and new fears about Mad Cow disease are all taking a toll on McDonalds What better reason for a contrarian to buy By Michael Sivy For a decade McDonalds stock set a record high every single year Then in the stock peaked just short of a share and its been downhill ever since McDonalds hit a low of less than in September and the share price has recovered by only since then The global hamburger chain still appears to face a spate of problems but many contrarianminded analysts see a great buying opportunity With outlets in countries McDonalds gets about half its sales and operating profits outside of North America Overall earnings were able to expand at an percent compound annual rate through most of the s because doubledigit growth internationally gave a huge boost to singledigit gains in the United States But the global growth engine began to falter with the Asian financial crisis in Since then overseas results have been penalized by unfavorable exchange rates particularly the weak euro which erodes the value of profits earned in much of Europe This year for instance foreign exchange losses could clip nearly percent from McDonalds net income Recently however an even bigger problem has emerged in Europe the resurgence of Mad Cow disease Various forms of brain disease have long occurred spontaneously in both animals and humans But adding the remnants of slaughtered animals to cattle feed a practice that used to be widespread in the UK appears to have spread some form of the disease more widely in that country Recently however infected cows have also been identified on the Continent leading to fears about the safety of European beef Analysts believe that could lead to a temporary drop in the consumption of McDonalds hamburgers Indeed the companys European sales were off percent in November Its scary but its also hard to believe that there will be any significant damage to McDonalds longterm results The use of animal remains in feed is heavily restricted today and there is little evidence that the practices that promoted Mad Cow were ever significant outside of the UK Moreover

November Fix your mix In volatile markets like this one sectors behave in radically different ways Heres what you need to know to find todays best opportunities By Michael Sivy When the economy is purring along most stock groups rise and fall together But amid uncertainty and turmoil different groups suffer at different times and rebound with varying delays Thats whats been happening this year and investors preparing for need to examine each sector independently to find the best bargains and to minimize risk Since January there have been three big divergences in the market The first has been between tech stocks and defensive groups The second has been between issues with high PEs and those with low PEs And the third has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with small caps After many months of leadership tech stocks peaked in March and have declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated Technology companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming quarters and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual investors began reducing their exposure By Thanksgiving even the strongest and most popular tech stocks including Cisco and Oracle were down a third or more from their highs And even at current levels the stocks arent cheap with PEs as high as Theyll be vulnerable to further declines until its clear that the economy has completed its downswing By contrast consumer stocks which are defensive because they arent as tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are benefited from investors flight to safety After having dropped by a third to less than a share in March Procter Gamble PG rebounded percent to And AnheuserBush BUD has rallied more than percent over the same period to Those stocks are now trading at more than times next years earnings so theyre no longer exceptionally cheap But such defensive issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been overloaded in tech Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector but they were helped even more by this years sharp runup in the price of oil ExxonMobil XOM one of the most conservative international oil companies has gained percent since March to a share I doubt however that oil can remain above a barrel for more than a year or two todays high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce demand As a result I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of their gains While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications Fiercely competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further equipment purchases The result is that stocks throughout the sector from service providers like ATT T and WorldCom WCOM to equipment manufacturers like Lucent LU have lost more than half their value since the spring Statistically I think stocks in the group are undervalued by a third but they still may represent dead money for the next six months These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of the roiling market but they arent the only one The largest US companies have average PEs in the mids and the most popular giants have PEs double or nearly triple historical levels By contrast small companies those with market caps of less than billion have average PEs of below From all these crosscurrents two important ideas emerge At any point theres likely to be at least one sector thats deeply undervalued Dont try to predict the turns just buy one or two of the blue chips in the sector that looks cheapest Right now defensive stocks are still in an uptrend but theyre no longer cheap while the techs are still falling their decline isnt over yet You can either buy good tech values and ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out The other important idea is that highPE bluechip growth stocks are way overvalued compared with everything else Of course those are the stocks everyone most wants to own But be smart diversify with a value fund or a fund that holds mid and smallcaps with an average PE below Theyre out there Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks go

contentlplpjspidmonyemy SIVY ON STOCKS from moneycom November Phone glut Lucent continues to suffer Will the stock recover anytime soon And will overcapacity problems in the industry spread to other telecom stocks By Michael Sivy Lucent LU is the Florida of the telecom sector Its big its booming and it cant stop bungling Lucents latest foulup was announced Tuesday The company said it would have to revise down the results reported for the September quarter because of errors in the way sales were recorded Even worse management said it wont be able to provide analysts with reliable earnings guidance for the current quarter The real problem isnt the money thirdquarter earnings will be hit by just about cents a share its the principle of the thing Investors always turn skeptical when a company overstates its prospects only to lower its sights later on And Lucent has been pulling the rug out from under analysts all year Investors get even more nervous when a company mentions accounting mistakes no matter how small or innocent they seem So Lucents most recent announcement sent the stock as low as down more than percent from the start of the year before recovering to Lucents latest troubles raise several questions for investors What are the companys problems What are the implications for the entire telecom sector And what do Lucents recurrent selloffs mean for valueoriented investors in todays market The last question is easiest to answer Were in the middle of a downtrend for technology stocks Companies that disappoint investors will receive little mercy And its very easy to get burned by a stock that appears to have bottomed I feel that particularly keenly since I recommended Lucent in July as a value play at a share after it was already down nearly percent from its alltime high see The shining deptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml As for Lucents problems two are unique to the company itself and both result from its spinoff from ATT in For more than a century Lucent had been able to rely on the Bell System as a captive customer and so the newly independent company failed to keep up with competitors in key areas like optical technology Second Lucent is still reshuffling top management to find a team that can get both the product line and the accounting system in good running order The broader question is what Lucents troubles indicate about the telecom sector Basically the entire sector is suffering from various forms of overcapacity All the telecom companies geared up in one way or another for much more business than has actually materialized The result when supply outruns demand is cutbacks in purchases of capital equipment and falling prices Those shortterm problems can be painful but excess capacity always gets used up and often far faster than analysts expect So I imagine that within a year or two all telecom companies will face a firmer pricing environment and their share prices will rally I believe that investors who want to build a longterm position in technology need to own telecom stocks Its impossible to know when any particular stock will bottom in the short run any telecomrelated stock could go lower and not even the most successful such as Cisco CSCO and Nortel Networks NT are completely safe But stocks like ATT T and WorldCom WCOM as well as Lucent all are trading at least a third below their asset value You have to buy when stocks look undervalued and then hang on without flinching if they go lower The longterm profit potential is there And the best protection is diversification and patience

about todays turbulent market AOL users go to Keyword Live chat From Sivys mailbox Here are my answers to recent emails about tech telecom John Malone and junk bonds By Michael Sivy Ive been receiving a lot of email lately about both the election and the carnage in tech stocks and its hard to say which upsets readers more The one thing that seems fairly certain is that neither is over yet The Florida Supreme Court may force a decision on the election before Thanksgiving or the legal wrangling may continue for several weeks Either way were looking at gridlock in Washington That means the surplus will balloon as increases in government spending and tax cuts are both stymied The swelling surplus could reduce the outstanding volume of Treasury bonds by as much as percent over the next couple of years That would be very bullish for all highquality bonds Treasury agency bluechip corporate and municipal On the other hand using the surplus to reduce debt instead of spending it or returning it to taxpayers who would spend it would sap the economys energy That could mean more earnings disappointments from economically sensitive companies over the next couple of months In the long run though gridlock could lay the foundation for a resumption of the stock market boom Debt reduction and an economic slowdown will probably encourage Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates substantially next year which would be a boon to the overall market Now heres a look at some specific questions Whats up with Cisco and Oracle The Nasdaq has been getting walloped and is now down percent from its highs Ive said that the damage to the tech sector isnt over and that the group may not rally as usual going into the new year Earnings fears are the chief cause of the selloff In addition the most popular tech stocks on the Nasdaq such as Cisco and Oracle carry PEs as high as I imagine that there will be a great buying opportunity for these stocks but they could get cheaper still When are the big telecoms such as ATT WorldCom and Lucent going to come back Ive recommended all three of these stocks as value buys see The shining moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml and After the tech wreck moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml And though each has since dropped I still believe each has asset values at least percent above current share prices But in this environment they probably wont rebound quickly If I already owned them Id certainly hold them And Id consider buying now though theres no rush Lucent looks like the most straightforward play followed by WorldCom ATT presents the most potential problems Whats going on with Liberty Media and why cant I find the ticker symbol Ive recommended Liberty Media Group a couple of times see The media master is back moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml and Leader of the free world moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml Since ATT acquired cable TV giant TCI Libertys programming operations have traded as an ATT tracking stock with the symbol LMG class A On some quote systems the symbol is given as LMGa on others as LMGA If you cant find it try the MONEYCOM Website where the stock is LMGA LMGA To my mind the case for Liberty is the case for John Malone He was the master of the industry back when he was CEO of TCI but he nearly disappeared from view after the acquisition Now with the spotlight back on Liberty Malone has the chance to be a player again particularly since ATT has announced that it intends to spin off Liberty as an independent company If the slowing economy is bullish for bonds why is my highyield bond fund down almost percent The slowing economy and the prospect for lower interest rates are extremely bullish for bonds of unquestioned financial strength Junk bonds suffer in an economy slowdown however because investors worry that the companies chances of default will increase If you own a junk mutual fund though Id hang on at this point I have a junk fund too and Im down nearly percent The worst of the decline is most likely behind us and junk bonds can rally powerfully after an economic slowdown ends Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To
