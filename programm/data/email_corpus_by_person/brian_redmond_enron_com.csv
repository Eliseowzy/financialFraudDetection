discussion then lets do it The current structure for allocating insurance costs does not provide the correct price signals to the business units as to the real cost of holding assets This year we have been asked to increase our velocity of capital cash flow and our return on equity Corporate charges need to provide the correct incentives to accomplish this I suggest that you use the cost of capital charge as a model to allocate cost that can be reassessed and reallocated at least at midyear Given that this year is waning I suggest that you absorb freed up insurance capacity at the corp level I imagine that if a business unit purchased an asset midyear it would bear an allocation of insurance cost so why not provide a savings when an asset is sold I will call to set up a time we can meet

October AM To Redmond Brian Clayton Paul Coffey Jr Jim Azore Jacquelyn Cc Whiting Greg Gruesen Karen Helton Susan Koehler Anne C Kitchen Louise Subject RE Replacement Cost Values The annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is based upon ENAs reported value of approximately The prorata credit for months assuming a sale date would be Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal Gathering these values within Enron normally requires to days We use these same values in the allocation system Unless the value change is significant the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted If we internally adjust your allocation midyear we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program As you know the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel We have not tried this before however I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENAs allocation all the other operating entities would want to resubmit their revised values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment In view of the time required this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron In view of the relatively small numbers I doubt that Corp would entertain this proposition either however we can approach them if you wish Original Message From Redmond Brian Sent Tuesday October AM To Clayton Paul Coffey Jr Jim Azore Jacquelyn Cc Whiting Greg Gruesen Karen Helton Susan Koehler Anne C Kitchen Louise Bouillion James L Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Paul Please let me know how much of the insurance premium is

Original Message From Clayton Paul Sent Tuesday October AM To Redmond Brian Coffey Jr Jim Azore Jacquelyn Cc Whiting Greg Gruesen Karen Helton Susan Koehler Anne C Kitchen Louise Bouillion James L Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Brian This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage Values are adjusted annually at renewal The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured In the event of a significant divestiture underwriters may consider a refund however the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enrons values as a whole Additionally Enrons adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures At renewal North Americas revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enrons overall values and your premium allocation will

Louise has too much on her plate I would strongly recommend you join until you actually change jobs The coal issue is one of concern to us Both Brian and I have extensive experience with coal plants They are much closer in EC and Operational content to process plants than CGT plants For what ever reason Mike Coleman has been super sensitive about any discussion He did not consider Bechtel because their local salesman responded in a negative manner to the specific question asked I am in constant contact with Bechtel Senior Power management due to Dabhol From a senior level Bechtel wants to work with us on coal and they made an approach to me on the subject When the senior Bechtel power salesperson visited Houston I invited Virgo and he got tangled in Fort Pierce and had to cancel Coleman was in Japan Bechtel has done a very good job on Phase II at Dabhol and due to our joint venture they have made only a reasonable profit It appears to me they really got to us on Dabhol Phase I I do not advocate Bechtel but by their experience in coal alone I believe we should listen to them carefully Once again I apologize for missing your meeting and I will also miss next week Keith Forwarded by Keith DodsonNAEnron on PM Keith Dodson PM To W David CT Christopher F CT cc Brian NRON Subject Monthly Meeting Coal Dave Chris Chris I have discussed with Dave Brian and I would like to request a monthly meeting with the two of you We believe we can do a better job for you if we understand your intent and strategy on development projects Too many times by the time the project information gets to us the distortion is significant Dave volunteered to offer some dates for our first meeting I would suggest one topic for our first meeting be coal projects From the attached messages it appears we are at a stage of some potentially significant decisions on a path forward with coal Based on our experience Brian and I believe a coal fired power plant is a significant management challenge compared to a CGT A few points to consider General Coal Fired Power plants have significantly different capital cost drivers than do combustion turbine projects The major OEMs scope is limited The critical commercial control path is not normally the boiler and steam turbine It is many times through the material handling systems The facility footprint has a tremendous impact on cost It is very difficult to remove the utility influences on cost and the OEMs and the contractors who do coal plants are significantly influenced by utility concepts Many cost capital cost disasters with these plants have root causes in the inability of owners teams to control themselves Due to the fact that there are many components the engineers and operators desire to optimize gets you into trouble in the control and timing of scope In addition the large number of components makes it difficult to visualize the project thus a large number of changes are incurred with the development of the actual design Industry experience indicates capital cost success in a coal plant is achieved by a bottom up or detail scope management process not a top down or functional specification which will work on a CGT installation The bottom up approach requires definition up front which is costly The options to secure the best price and practice on coal plants are limited and in general have a basic issue in that the options that are lower cost on the front end are potentially high cost in execution and vice versa The contractors OEMs that we can turn to for a coal plant are limited A full liability wrap makes the list even smaller Due to the risk a wrap is going to be very expensive for a coal plant and without a doubt will dramatically raise the capital cost due to designed in over capacity and redundancy In a CGT this is never an issue as it is internal to the power island pricing As mentioned below Bechtel has the most experience in the world on coal fired plants The have developed the powerline series of standard design plants This standard plant concept has been very successful for Bechtel in reducing the cost of process plants which face the same issues as coal fired power plants Supposedly Bechtel has engineered utility preferences out of these plants They have plants in their offering On pulverized coal they offer X MW and X MW although they yet have to get their first X MW order On circulating fluidized bed they offer a X MW They have developed but not sold a MW IGCC based on their Tennessee Eastman model Their order of magnitude costs look competitive but care is cautioned due reasons stated of needing to carefully examine the scope on coal plants Despite all this planning and effort as the note below indicates Bechtel had significant cost and schedule problems on their Red Hills CFB Powerline X MW project in Mississippi for Tractebel The Bechtel team on this project was among their best The problem is publicized as a lack of construction labor The large number of components drives the labor requirements up dramatically for the same investment in a CGT Bechtel has filed suit against Tractebel for force majeure claiming the lack of labor is a force majeure event That is certainly a unique concept It is clear Bechtel holds Tractebel responsible for some of its problems I do feel Bechtels open shop company Becon is weak Historically Starkeville Mississippi has been a good labor market In summary even Bechtel can get in trouble on a coal plant Alstom is solid OEM for many plant components but I would have concerns about their engineering and construction skills to manage a coal plant Also we will have little means to control the cost as development is mostly theirs Recently we faced a similar issue on the Bahamas LNG terminal In that case we have decided to partially fund two companies in a design contest In addition to a clear competitive drive we will have claim to all developments in both designs and this concept gives us the bottoms up detail definition with which to control the scope The cost is considered reasonable by management in light of the risk Our future is your success Keith Dodson Forwarded

Enron will agree to consider Bechtel Bechtel representatives are requesting the opportunity to present their capability interest to our team at our convenience Friday afternoon I discussed this with Mitch Robinson and asked his position He indicated that at this time ENa has not executed any document binding ENa to work exclusively with one supplier and that he did not anticipate making such a commitment for several weeks ENa will still consider other qualified parties if those parties respond quickly and provide substantive information I was not able to get through to the the Business Development VP in Gaithersberg Friday but will call him Monday morning around AM At that time I will do the following Reconfirm that Bechtel is seriously interested If so are they motivated to react quickly providing detailed information that had been previously requested and which subsequently only AP developed If this is the case I will determine when our team could be available for a presentation in our offices and set up a meeting transmit the Pro Forma information that we requested all respondents to provide only AP provided any meaningful information transmit the subsequently developed conceptual information for only the Brownsville and Brighton opportunities transmit copies of the most recent site information developed as well as pictures of the Brownsville site confirm that there is an appropriate Confidentiality Agreement forward them copies of the draft MOU when it is available I believe there may be a preexisting PSA between the parties which may vacate some of the commercial disucssions There should be little doubt that Bechtel is qualified has the resources and balance sheet to perform the EPC function on major multiple projects simultaneously No other organization has built as many green field power plants as Bechtel nationally or internationally Historically Bechtel performs work at no or nominal risk Cost plus has been their favorite commercial position It is worth noting that their current Red Hills Project x Alstrom CFBs is finishing months late and is reported to have incurred maximum LD penalties indicating that the problems encountered were not Owner caused I am presuming that the draft MOU is still being processed and per Naveeds message will be available for transmittal to early next week Based on Mat Gimbels email late Friday there is concern that the proposed site visit could create unnecessary problems unless the LOI is already executed The suggestion has been made that it be delayed until the LOI is executed Since I am just now starting to get up to speed on the Brighton opportunity and not familiar with the politics please advise your comments ASAP There is no question that delaying the process a week would give

the arrangements should not be linked Based on Marks conclusion I would like to get together internally to figure out what should be done on the storage and transport agreement It might be in the best

Bridgeline Holding LPs bankruptcy counsel today he stated that he thought ENA would be unable to reject that storage and transport contracts with Bridgeline without ENA also rejecting the Partnership Agreement for Bridgeline What are your thoughts on this Their counsels argument was that these long term contracts were part of the consideration for TEPI to enter into the LP and as such ENA would not be able to escape the obligations of these contracts and still obtain the benefits of the LP Some background Bridgeline Holdings LP was formed in March of with ENA holding equity and Texaco Exploration Production Inc holds the other equity Management of the LP is ENA and TEPI both contributed natural gas pipeline assets located in Louisana into the Partnership ENA entered into a long term storage and transport agreement the ones you have seen at the time of the closing of this deal These agreements call for monthly demand charges There is also a letter agreement concerning early termination of the storage and transport agreements The letter states You ENA acknowledge and agree that such termination fees are necessary to induce TEPI to enter into that certain Amended and
