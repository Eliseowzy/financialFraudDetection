shallow water of the continental shelf contain twice as much natural gas as oil that is reversed in water depths of feet or more The National Petroleum Council forecasts annual dema nd will rise to Tcf by from about Tcf now According to the MMS natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has fallen steadily from a pe ak of Tcf in to Tcf in During that period deepwater na tural gas production actually rose to Bcf from Bcf but not enough to offset the larger drop in shallow water production The MMS forecasts a wide range of possibilities for the future with total Gulf of Mexico outpu t possibly falling up to by or rising as high as In an effort to increase production the MMS has introduced royalty relief for companie s that drill very deep wells in the shallow waters Although the shallow wa ters have been thoroughly explored very few wells have been drilled to feet or deeper The MMS estimates there could be up to Tcf of recove rable reserves of deep wells The Rocky Mountain

refunds requested by Pacific Northwest municipal utilities and wholesale electricity buyers for power purchases last spring when prices jumped sharply higher The ALJ pointed out that the Pacific No rthwest market is very different than the California market because Califo rnia state law prohibited utilities from passing higher power costs on to c ustomers while the market worked properly in the Pacific Northwest when su pplies were tight The Northwestern states rely heavily on hydroelectric po wer and suffered a draught situation which coincided with a shortage of ele ctricity supplies throughout the Western US The ALJ contends that the Paci fic Northwest experienced a sudden and acute drop in available supply and in that situation prices rose dramatically as should be normal Of the tot al billion sought in refunds California has laid claim to almost billion YOU DESIGNED IT WE BUILT IT ZaiNet GasMaster II Todays most comprehensive gas trading scheduling and accounting system CAMINUS Your Competitive Edge in Energy Call us at or visit us at the website Governor Expected to Order Lawmakers Back In attempt to prevent the bankruptcy of Southern California Edison the governor is poised to order lawmakers to return to Sacramento after they adjourned last week without voting on a rescue plan for the utility The go vernor is in the process of developing a proposal and is consulting with st ate senators and Assembly members to find an acceptable compromise between the two legislative houses The new plan will probably allow SCE to sell be tween and billion in bonds which would be secured by existing cha rges to about of its biggest commercial consumers Californias Senate has approved a version of the bill voting for billion in bond sales but secured by the rates of of SCEs largest customers In addition the state would have the option to purchase the utilitys transmission line s at book value SCE argues that the plan would not prevent its bankruptcy The Assembly version increased the bond sale to billion and spread th e costs over business customers In addition the lawmakers gave th e state the option to buy the transmission grid at double the book value or at market value whichever is less and a provision to reinstate the retai l power market However when the Senate received the amended bill it decl ined to vote on the measure adjourning for the year instead The governor is expected to limit the topics under discussion by the legislature when th ey return in order to prevent lawmakers from discussing bills unrelated to the rescue plan
