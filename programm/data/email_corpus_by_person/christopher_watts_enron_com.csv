Year Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow JonesThe MidAmerican Interconnected Network Inc a gridmonitoring group for the central Midwest region said Wednesday that increased power supplies will improve utilities ability to meet expected demand levels in the region this summer In its annual summer assessment MAIN said that megawatts of new power has been added in the region in the last year or will be online before the summer begins About megawatts of this new power is committed to serving demand in the MAIN area which includes Illinois Wisconsin and parts of Michigan and Missouri MAIN members have improved their ability to serve customers by adding new generation making power purchases and upgrading the electric transmission system said Richard Bulley MAINs executive director in a release We do not anticipate any major limitations on the regions bulk transmission system and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than The summer report was approved by MAINs board of directors Tuesday MAIN spokeswoman Jackie Olson said MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT DJ MAINSummer Peak Pwr Load Seen Up Almost MAIN estimates that its peak load will reach megawatts this year a boost from last years actual peak load If power cuts to customers with interruptible service contracts were enacted to conserve supplies or if other load management practices were used MAIN estimated that the region can reduce summer load by megawatts if needed While peak loads seem to be growing at an extreme pace demand levels were actually much lighterthanexpected last year MAINs Olson noted Last year was just an unusually cool summer she said In by comparison MAINs actual peak demand load spiked to a record megawatts amid extremely hot weather Olson said By comparing this years expected peak load with s actual peak load MAINs demand levels are actually increasing at a steady rate The figures have been adjusted to reflect Madison Wisbased Alliant Energy Corps LNT move into MAIN last summer Supply and load from western parts of the utilitys system are now operated in MAIN instead of the neighboring MidContinent Area Power Pool region MAINs summer report estimates that megawatts of power will be available in the region this summer to meet the expected demand boost including contract purchases of megawatts That amount is up sharply from last springs forecasts for megawatts of summer supplies The strong power supply boost should give the region an available reserve margin of this summer compared with forecasts for a reserve margin a year ago Most US grid regions target at least a summer margin to guard against heatdriven demand spikes and unplanned power plant outages MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT DJ MAINSummer Transmission Tight But Manageable According to MAINs summer report MAINs import capabilities from its surrounding regions are considered adequate A major Illinois transmission system added by Exelon Corps EXC Commonwealth Edison Co last summer as well as transmission upgrades from other utilities have improved transmission reliability in certain key areas of the region MAIN said The grid group estimates that if any major transmission components are lost in the region import capability from other regions will be slightly tighter than last year But this estimate has been recalibrated to account for Alliants move into MAIN and overall transmission capacity seems to have improved MAINs Olson said MAIN also said in its report that heavy transmission flow from the north to south last summer resulted in numerous requests for transmission loading relief or TLRs that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened lines System reinforcements and changes in operating measures will enhance the effectiveness of TLR actions this summer MAIN said in the report

Year Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow JonesThe MidAmerican Interconnected Network Inc a gridmonitoring group for the central Midwest region said Wednesday that increased power supplies will improve utilities ability to meet expected demand levels in the region this summer In its annual summer assessment MAIN said that megawatts of new power has been added in the region in the last year or will be online before the summer begins About megawatts of this new power is committed to serving demand in the MAIN area which includes Illinois Wisconsin and parts of Michigan and Missouri MAIN members have improved their ability to serve customers by adding new generation making power purchases and upgrading the electric transmission system said Richard Bulley MAINs executive director in a release We do not anticipate any major limitations on the regions bulk transmission system and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than The summer report was approved by MAINs board of directors Tuesday MAIN spokeswoman Jackie Olson said MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT DJ MAINSummer Peak Pwr Load Seen Up Almost MAIN estimates that its peak load will reach megawatts this year a boost from last years actual peak load If power cuts to customers with interruptible service contracts were enacted to conserve supplies or if other load management practices were used MAIN estimated that the region can reduce summer load by megawatts if needed While peak loads seem to be growing at an extreme pace demand levels were actually much lighterthanexpected last year MAINs Olson noted Last year was just an unusually cool summer she said In by comparison MAINs actual peak demand load spiked to a record megawatts amid extremely hot weather Olson said By comparing this years expected peak load with s actual peak load MAINs demand levels are actually increasing at a steady rate The figures have been adjusted to reflect Madison Wisbased Alliant Energy Corps LNT move into MAIN last summer Supply and load from western parts of the utilitys system are now operated in MAIN instead of the neighboring MidContinent Area Power Pool region MAINs summer report estimates that megawatts of power will be available in the region this summer to meet the expected demand boost including contract purchases of megawatts That amount is up sharply from last springs forecasts for megawatts of summer supplies The strong power supply boost should give the region an available reserve margin of this summer compared with forecasts for a reserve margin a year ago Most US grid regions target at least a summer margin to guard against heatdriven demand spikes and unplanned power plant outages MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT DJ MAINSummer Transmission Tight But Manageable According to MAINs summer report MAINs import capabilities from its surrounding regions are considered adequate A major Illinois transmission system added by Exelon Corps EXC Commonwealth Edison Co last summer as well as transmission upgrades from other utilities have improved transmission reliability in certain key areas of the region MAIN said The grid group estimates that if any major transmission components are lost in the region import capability from other regions will be slightly tighter than last year But this estimate has been recalibrated to account for Alliants move into MAIN and overall transmission capacity seems to have improved MAINs Olson said MAIN also said in its report that heavy transmission flow from the north to south last summer resulted in numerous requests for transmission loading relief or TLRs that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened lines System reinforcements and changes in operating measures will enhance the effectiveness of TLR actions this summer MAIN said in the report

Year Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow JonesThe MidAmerican Interconnected Network Inc a gridmonitoring group for the central Midwest region said Wednesday that increased power supplies will improve utilities ability to meet expected demand levels in the region this summer In its annual summer assessment MAIN said that megawatts of new power has been added in the region in the last year or will be online before the summer begins About megawatts of this new power is committed to serving demand in the MAIN area which includes Illinois Wisconsin and parts of Michigan and Missouri MAIN members have improved their ability to serve customers by adding new generation making power purchases and upgrading the electric transmission system said Richard Bulley MAINs executive director in a release We do not anticipate any major limitations on the regions bulk transmission system and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than The summer report was approved by MAINs board of directors Tuesday MAIN spokeswoman Jackie Olson said MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT DJ MAINSummer Peak Pwr Load Seen Up Almost MAIN estimates that its peak load will reach megawatts this year a boost from last years actual peak load If power cuts to customers with interruptible service contracts were enacted to conserve supplies or if other load management practices were used MAIN estimated that the region can reduce summer load by megawatts if needed While peak loads seem to be growing at an extreme pace demand levels were actually much lighterthanexpected last year MAINs Olson noted Last year was just an unusually cool summer she said In by comparison MAINs actual peak demand load spiked to a record megawatts amid extremely hot weather Olson said By comparing this years expected peak load with s actual peak load MAINs demand levels are actually increasing at a steady rate The figures have been adjusted to reflect Madison Wisbased Alliant Energy Corps LNT move into MAIN last summer Supply and load from western parts of the utilitys system are now operated in MAIN instead of the neighboring MidContinent Area Power Pool region MAINs summer report estimates that megawatts of power will be available in the region this summer to meet the expected demand boost including contract purchases of megawatts That amount is up sharply from last springs forecasts for megawatts of summer supplies The strong power supply boost should give the region an available reserve margin of this summer compared with forecasts for a reserve margin a year ago Most US grid regions target at least a summer margin to guard against heatdriven demand spikes and unplanned power plant outages MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT DJ MAINSummer Transmission Tight But Manageable According to MAINs summer report MAINs import capabilities from its surrounding regions are considered adequate A major Illinois transmission system added by Exelon Corps EXC Commonwealth Edison Co last summer as well as transmission upgrades from other utilities have improved transmission reliability in certain key areas of the region MAIN said The grid group estimates that if any major transmission components are lost in the region import capability from other regions will be slightly tighter than last year But this estimate has been recalibrated to account for Alliants move into MAIN and overall transmission capacity seems to have improved MAINs Olson said MAIN also said in its report that heavy transmission flow from the north to south last summer resulted in numerous requests for transmission loading relief or TLRs that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened lines System reinforcements and changes in operating measures will enhance the effectiveness of TLR actions this summer MAIN said in the report
