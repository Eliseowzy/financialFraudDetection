one of the largest and most lucrative health markets of the Western world Best of all its stock is what I call a Why the heck not investment Its lowpriced you can pick up a thousand shares for around now And it has the potential to MULTIPLY that small investment to TIMES over in the next couple years See why I call it Why the heck not Just a tiny amount of risk capital can turn into a really nice chunk of change Frankly my worst expectations are for a NEARTERM DOUBLE That happens and you can even sell half your position keep half and have none of your original investment at risk Everything after that is gravy THATS THE BIOTECH GAME my friend Its one of the few ways left for the average guy to get stinking rich So if youve got a little cash to spare and have a love for tapemeasure home runs youve got to check this stock out Heres the story Gene sequencing and human cloning get all the headlines but a lot of the most compelling work in biotech comes from much more boring fields This little company for example is doing AMAZING STUFF with common carbohydrate compounds In fact its experimental drug GBC may prove to be one of the biggest success stories of the decade LET ME STRESS the word experimental Its not approved yet its still going through clinical trials Thats why the stock price is so lowbut thats also why you have a chance to multiply your investment twenty fold if you get in now This drug may be experimental but its also on the FASTTRACK towards FDAapproval Management stepped up the pace of clinical studies after initial results proved very favorable In fact Phase results primarily used to show the safety of a drug showed REMARKABLE BENEFITS against prostate cancer It stabilized or reduced PSA prostate specific antigen levels in of the patients with advanced cancer tested High PSAs of course are a marker of prostate cancer and a sign that the disease is spreading uncontrollably Today there is no effective treatment that improves the survival rates for men whose cancer continues to spread even after surgery Thats why this news is so important It means new hope for patients who thought they had none AND FOR INVESTORS like us it means wealth potentially beyond our wildest dreams Remember clinical trials are still ongoing But GBC seems to work by attaching itself to receptor points on individual cells much like the space shuttle docks at the orbiting space station Once locked in this drug thwarts the typical metastatic action that is it stops the cancer from spreading Imagine the wealthbuilding potential But the story doesnt stop there Animalmodeling with GBC suggests a possible BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of pancreatic cancer which typically has a fiveyear death rate of of mice survived past the day benchmark versus none given the mostcommonly used drug for pancreatic cancer And of the GBC mice were CURED of their tumors Phase II trials on human pancreatic and colorectal cancer patients are now underway And any positive news here should send this stock skyrocketing WHATS MORE this biotech is not some onetrick pony One of its more interesting developments is CAN a new breakthrough against drugresistant fungus including Aspergillus and Candida Preclinical studies suggest its very effective and extremely fastacting Icing on the cake I wont claim that everyone should own this stock Its an aggressive play and
