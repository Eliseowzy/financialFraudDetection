<13274410.1075845724050.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,greg.krause@enron.com,2001-05-23 06:13:00,RE AEWs backupyou On the SDEC this is no longer an play To keep it as an play three things need to happen we need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the jurisdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board CZAB to the Board of County Commissioners The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with NIMBYs We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after weeks of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB we feel we will be facing sudden death However if we go before the County Commissioners we will have a very good chance of success The vehicle we propose to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application of Vested Rights As I understand it Im getting info on this today this is a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any use of his property This application needs to be submitted to the county before June th the date of our CZAB hearing we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management DERM who is responsible for ensuring that the land fill be closed They have been pushing the owner of the property to initiate the closure work The land owner Certrosa Holdings is a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela If we were not in the picture I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default on the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up at to million To keep this as an play we will need to get DERM to agree to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we will need provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get in the chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landfill We may need to initiate this conversation in the next to weeks we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September The strike price for this property is approximately million and we paid for a month option last October when the rules were soft costs could not exceed of the total project cost of million Based on the success of and above we may need to initiate this discussion in the next to weeks as well On the Medley Dunn discussions As you know when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns last month they had two deal breakers a they wanted a committment on our part that we would pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax abatement we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town would not involve the Dunns b they wanted us to assume all past and present environmental liabilities We said no to both conditions and halted discussions I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns that they are considering giving on both these items If we structured an arrangement where we did a phase environmental assessment during a to day due diligence period rather than in an option period or under a day lease gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the results of the phase and we change the agreement back to the way it was in the last Andrew Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical environmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise in the future but are not the result of our operations Would this arrangement give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if necessary to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any clean up If this is something we can work with we need to have a conversation with the Dunns attorney What do you think Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May AM To Krause Greg Subject RE AEWs backup Greg You can call me on whatever you

need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the jurisdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board CZAB to the Board of County Commissioners The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with NIMBYs We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after weeks of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB we feel we will be facing sudden death However if we go before the County Commissioners we will have a very good chance of success The vehicle we propose to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application of Vested Rights As I understand it Im getting info on this today this is a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any use of his property This application needs to be submitted to the county before June th the date of our CZAB hearing we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management DERM who is responsible for ensuring that the land fill be closed They have been pushing the owner of the property to initiate the closure work The land owner Certrosa Holdings is a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela If we were not in the picture I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default on the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up at to million To keep this as an play we will need to get DERM to agree to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we will need provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get in the chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landfill We may need to initiate this conversation in the next to weeks we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September The strike price for this property is approximately million and we paid for a month option last October when the rules were soft costs could not exceed of the total project cost of million Based on the success of and above we may need to initiate this discussion in the next to weeks as well On the Medley Dunn discussions As you know when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns last month they had two deal breakers a they wanted a committment on our part that we would pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax abatement we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town would not involve the Dunns b they wanted us to assume all past and present environmental liabilities We said no to both conditions and halted discussions I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns that they are considering giving on both these items If we structured an arrangement where we did a phase environmental assessment during a to day due diligence period rather than in an option period or under a day lease gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the results of the phase and we change the agreement back to the way it was in the last Andrew Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical environmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise in the future but are not the result of our operations Would this arrangement give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if necessary to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any clean up If this is something we can work with we

need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the jurisdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board CZAB to the Board of County Commissioners The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with NIMBYs We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after weeks of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB we feel we will be facing sudden death However if we go before the County Commissioners we will have a very good chance of success The vehicle we propose to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application of Vested Rights As I understand it Im getting info on this today this is a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any use of his property This application needs to be submitted to the county before June th the date of our CZAB hearing we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management DERM who is responsible for ensuring that the land fill be closed They have been pushing the owner of the property to initiate the closure work The land owner Certrosa Holdings is a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela If we were not in the picture I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default on the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up at to million To keep this as an play we will need to get DERM to agree to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we will need provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get in the chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landfill We may need to initiate this conversation in the next to weeks we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September The strike price for this property is approximately million and we paid for a month option last October when the rules were soft costs could not exceed of the total project cost of million Based on the success of and above we may need to initiate this discussion in the next to weeks as well On the Medley Dunn discussions As you know when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns last month they had two deal breakers a they wanted a committment on our part that we would pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax abatement we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town would not involve the Dunns b they wanted us to assume all past and present environmental liabilities We said no to both conditions and halted discussions I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns that they are considering giving on both these items If we structured an arrangement where we did a phase environmental assessment during a to day due diligence period rather than in an option period or under a day lease gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the results of the phase and we change the agreement back to the way it was in the last Andrew Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical environmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise in the future but are not the result of our operations Would this arrangement give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if necessary to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any clean up If this is something we can work with we

Rights As I understand it Im getting info on this today this is a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any use of his property This application needs to be submitted to the county bef ore June th the date of our CZAB hearing we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management DERM who is responsible for ensurin g that the land fill be closed They have been pushing the owner of the pr operty to initiate the closure work The land owner Certrosa Holdings i s a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela If we wer e not in the picture I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default on the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up at to million To keep this as an play we will need to get DERM to agree to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we wi ll need provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get i n the chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landf ill We may need to initiate this conversation in the next to weeks we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September The strike price for this property is approximately million and we p aid for a month option last October when the rules were soft co sts could not exceed of the total project cost of million Based on the success of and above we may need to initiate this discussio n in the next to weeks as well On the Medley Dunn discussions As you know when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns last month they had two deal breakers a they wanted a committment on our part that we wo uld pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax abatemen t we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town would not involve the Dunns b they wanted us to assume all past and present enviro nmental liabilities We said no to both conditions and halted discussions I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns that they are considering giving on both these items If we structured an arrangemen t where we did a phase environmental assessment during a to day du e diligence period rather than in an option period or under a day leas e gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the result s of the phase and we change the agreement back to the way it was in th e last Andrew Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical en vironmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise in the future but are not the result of our operations Would this arrange ment give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if necessary to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any clean up If this is something
