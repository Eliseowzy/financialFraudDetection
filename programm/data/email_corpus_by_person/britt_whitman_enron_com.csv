DWR Rate Agreement Californias Assembly Rallies Round a New MOU The lights were burning late in the California Capitol last night as lawmak ers in the Democratic caucus volleyed final versions of the newly consolida ted Edison MOU bill AB Details leaked to the public concentrate on dis putes over the valuation of SoCals transmission line assets however sour ces report this matter is only a prelude to even greater contentious langua ge buried in the bills various sub clauses Earlier media reports noting that the bill would be based on Senator Burtons preferred legislation are also far off the mark The draft bill tries to get the State out of the po wer business as fast as possible and binds power users to decades of high p rices The proposed language also significantly reduces the chance of a So Cal Ed bankruptcy and provides the company with lavish concessions SoCal Ed is complaining about some technical details in public but the draft bil l offers probably the most generous deal any electricity utility has seen f rom regulators Sacramento insiders tell us the bill has a pretty good ch ance of passing in the next days but could touch off a political and legal storm because of its draconian impact on Californian power users The Assemblys AB contains three primary additions that distinguish it f rom thee Senates SB XX bill and The Governor and Assembly Democrats propose to charge a massive exit fee to any end user wanting to switch a future alternative power providers All California electricity users will be liable for the cost of Governor Davis expensive longterm power contracts for their whole term save muni cipalities like SMUD and LADWP This is apparently the only acceptable co mpromise for legislators that would both secure revenue to cover the State s longterm power costs and maintain the promise of direct access establish ed at the onset of Californias deregulation The clause sidesteps some of the obstacles the California State Constitution places in the way of stopp ing direct access particularly for municipalities But it could still be open to legal challenge California officials hope that it will be enough to quiet the issue until the October power bond sale is finalized The Assembly expanded the rate base of commercial class users to pay back SoCals bailout bonds by incorporating small businesses that use k W It appears likely that this change was made because SP told the state that a larger rate base would be needed to support the bailout bonds SP wants all ratepayers to help repay and secure the bailout bonds including small businesses This change is likely to draw heavy fire from the powerf ul California Technology and Manufacturers Alliance CTMA The PUC will be mandated to set rates at any level necessary to preser ve SoCal Edisons solvency and borrowing ability This regulation essentia lly links consumer electricity rates with maintaining SoCals investment gr ade credit rating Arguably SoCal would need to do little more than make a case that that SP might downgrade them and the CPUC would necessarily re spond with a rate increase If SoCal can get this concession the nickel an d dimes issue of transmission line valuation will be muted a promising sig n to those fearing bankruptcy Sources within the Sacramento Capitol inform us that the Governor and Hertz berg are likely to get their way for now The precise wording of the clause s may be toyed with in the final markup session but we understand there is considerable momentum behind the substance There are some indications th at the Governor may have overestimated the amount of support AB has in th e Assembly Republicans are not on board so if the bill passes it will be subject to days delay before taking effect It remains unclear whether the plan will come to a vote next week Whenif the plan does pass it wi ll likely have no more than a chance of escaping the Senate Senator B urton the consumer advocates and the CTMA are staunchly against any plan that would include small businesses in paying off SoCals bailout bonds S en Minority leader Burlte told several lobbyists yesterday that the Republ icans would walk away from any amended SB XX that emerged in the House h aving already agreed to the Sher bill SB XX before the recess This is reportedly the same attitude Brultes counterpart in the Senate John Burto n has articulated and not a good sign for Edison Direct Access Contrary to the CPUCs press release explaining their decision to delay the direct access ruling to allow more time to review the case sources report the reason for the delay is that the Commission prefers to wait for the Le gislature to act on SB XX bond repayment before ruling Key business c ommunity leaders expect the PUC to formally end direct access on Sept H owever the Legislature has the authority to reinstate direct access in wha tever form it may choose Presuming the PUC carries out the expected action and permanently suspends direct access the following are some possible outcomes The Legislature under pressure from a unified business community coul d restore direct access before the end of the session allowing moderate Dem ocrats in swing districts to say they protected the economic climate but o nly with exit fees and time commitment restrictions that are unpalatable to businesses Many in the business community are willing to accept having to eat a DWR surcharge for longterm power contract commitments and a surch arge to pay for a substantial portion of Edisons accumulated debt But acc ording to our sources Legislative Democrats are insisting on exit fees sub stantially beyond these surcharges to head off the need for additional resi dential rate increases that might be needed to satisfy DWR commitments If this occurs or if the Legislature simply stands idle and declines t o restore direct access business leaders may likely give up on direct acce ss and shift their efforts to restructuring the rate allocation to shift a greater portion of the burden to the residential ratepayer classes The Ma rch rate increase by the PUC placed a disproportionate share of the revenue requirement burden on the industrial ratepayer classes This would presen t a huge political challenge But because the amount of net short power exp ected to be available for direct access agreements is so small one estim ate places it at no more than MW or about of demand through there is growing sentiment in the business community that it is no long er really worth fighting for direct access given the political obstacles Additionally there is the interesting prospect that DWR itself might e xpand and dominate the market for net short power sales given the agencys expected surplus supply via the forward contracts There is nothing in law or regulation currently that would prevent DWR from acting as a market par ticipant and selling excess power indeed DWR already sells excess power t o municipal utilities private utilities and power managers outside Califor nia DWR Rate Agreement and Edison Rescue In the Senate informational hearing today on the DWR rate agreement DWR re presentatives acknowledged that the agency is still negotiating contracts f or additional forward power This prompted concern by some legislators and consumer activists who believe DWR has already overpurchased long term po wer causing sales by DWR of excess power for as little as per MW at tim es this summer

Overcharge Claims BC Government The BC Liberals have announced that they are putting together a new Policy Task Force on Energy to deal with energy issues going forward They will be looking at the provinces energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward The Task Force includes Jack Ebbels Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Energy and Mines Chair Peter Meekison energy policy consultant John Bechtold oil and gas expert Erik Westergaard hydroelectricity expert Brenda Eaton Deputy Minister to the Premier Our information is that the Policy Task Force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process Additionally the Canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the US tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the States A BC Cabinet Minister has made veiled threats to tie Canadian energy exports to the United States to eliminating the softwood timber tariff Jean Chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in Northern BC along BC Hydro BC Hydro Chair Larry Bell is softpeddling the BC Liberals message of deregulation Coming under intense scrutiny Bell has already gone public to defend BC Hydros rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and PowerEx operations will not be deregulated We noticed however that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off which appears is indeed going forth We believe that BC Hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the shorttomedium term Two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are TransElect Corporation which has indicated it is watching the British Columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in Calgary and TransConnect which has been working with the RTOWest group which could eventually plug BC Hydros transmission systems into the RTO West grid Bell has been talking about instituting a tieredrate plan for BCs own energyintensive industries allowing energyefficient plants to maintain their preferred rate increasing rates for others He is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in BC However Bell has not been as hot on clean coal generation as Neufeld having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology which has been economically and environmentally sound Strategically Hydros export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border From what we are seeing of the new Chairmans position it appears that BC Hydro will attempt to sever the feeling of entitlement that BCs own energyintensive industries have relied on That is Hydro is snooping around the States for greener pastures after having had a taste of the California windfall last year Why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere BPA Financial Conditions To everyones relief BPA last week announced there would be no additional rate increase In early August the agency had warned that its prethird quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financialbased cost recovery adjustment clause FB CRAC one of three CRACs BPA and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices The loadbased LB CRAC has already driven a percent rate increase and the FB CRAC could have added another mills But the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger so there will be no additional rate hike Additionally we have also heard that BPA is still committed to spending roughly million next year on fish and wildlife issues FERC Refunds Although BPA has not issued an official statement as a net supplier to California it is likely that BPA would be opposed to Californias attempt to recoup over billion in perceived overcharges from the Pacific Northwest Earlier this year BPA responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled BPA response to California ISO study on April which maintained that its operations were above reproach BPA will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from CalISOs allegations Pacific Northwest utilities and other energyusing entities such as the City of Tacoma and the Port of Seattle also have joined in the fray to pursue billion in perceived overcharges The name of the game on the West Coast is to say that you were a net importer not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by FERC and the federal judge Everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers not sellers Spill Issues The Power Planning Council has recommended spending more than million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year Most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the John Day River in Oregon with million to pay for irrigation screens in the Yakima River The million is in addition to million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at mainstem dams BPA had agreed to fund million worth of the Councils list Other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the South Fork of Idahos Clearwater River spending to improve fish passage in a tributary of Oregons Umatilla River and

Hertzberg reportedly had votes in favor of the bailout that he could count on There were more votes that were close and stood a reasonable chance of being cast in favor of the bailo ut However that still left Hertzberg votes short of the he needs Earlier today Sen Polanco the bills sponsor privately indicated that t he few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended SB XX were in place due to lobbying efforts by Gov Davis No doubt the count will be close b ut Hertzberg will only take the bill up in the Assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows Democrats can muster enough support The key issues related to getting the votes to pass SB XX are the foll owing Including the option to buy the transmission lines For some this is a phi losophical issue these members are quite adamant that the option to buy th e lines needs to be removed from SB XX Excess profits and creditworthiness In particular how Edison can use any profits The philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necess ary given the experience with PGE And members are skittish about voting for a bailout with the possibility of a bankruptcy still possible anyway According to Assembly leadership sources no Senator has asked the Speaker s Office for anything to be put in the bill except for a Central Valley se nator Jim Costa who played a party in brokering the deal on Shaver Lake Leadership sources were surprised by that and believe that many senators will not hold to the Burton line of dont even change a period in the bil l Several senators including Polanco and Costa are vested in the bills passage and will want to see it brought up for a vote despite significant o pposition Many people including Polanco believe that Burton may require his worker s compensation reform plan to be doublejoined to the Edison MOU in order t o take it up for a vote Double joining is a legislative maneuver that tie s the fate of both bills together It creates a situation where both must be passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in order to go into effect If the Governor only signs one neither becomes law But the Gov ernors office has told us that Burton made a direct statement to them last week that he had no intention to double join workers comp reform to SB x x Some suggest that Senate opposition lead by Burton which remains considera ble may introduce a new bailout bill if SB XX passes the Assembly This new bill would be designed to be unacceptable to the Assembly The Senate then would pass this bill on the last day of the session and then adjourn without a conference committee The Assembly would then be left to accept or reject the Senates bill without the possibility of amendments This is somewhat similar to what the Senate did in July only now the recess wil l be until next year SoCal Bailout Barriers Regarding media reports referencing Assemblyman Keelys deal with Davis to exempt acres of the Shaver Lake area from the bills conservation eas ements the protesters representing Fresno feel that this is not good enoug h and they intend to pursue their lawsuit against the state regarding the e asements These protestors and the Republicans who represent them felt t hat they had achieved compromise language in the bailout last week but thi s language is now gone While the Shaver Lake amendments and all conserva tion easement language are again in the bill we do not believe this will significantly interfere with the bills passage Some Central Valley membe rs voted in support of the bill despite the amendments and there is only o ne Democrat Dean Florez who may vote against it because of them Some Senators also reportedly considering removing language from the bond p ortion of the bailout bill that makes the bonds Harveyproof that is i mmune from a referendum by consumer advocates This language which was pr eviously used in the California rate reduction bonds is structured such th at Californias credit could be compromised if the bonds are not repaid th is is done by involving the California Infrastructure Bank as a party to th e bonds Some members of the Senate who are in close contact with Harvey Rosenfield and the consumer advocates have expressed that they want to remo ve this language as a diplomatic way to destroy the bailout If the langua ge is removed there is no way that the states credit is tied to the bonds This means that the bonds can be challenged by a voter referendum withou t endangering the state Current polls show that such a referendum which would allow voters to choose not to pay the surcharge on power bills to bai l out SoCal would very likely succeed This would mean that the bonds cou ld not be repaid Wall Street firms have stated expressly that they will not purchase the bon ds if they are susceptible to a voter referendum meaning that removing the Harveyproofing language will likely mean that the bailout bonds will no t be able to be sold SoCal is also aware of this possibility if the lang uage comes out of the bill the plan will no longer be acceptable to SoCal SoCal Selling Out or Going Under There is word in Sacramento of companies sniffing around for a prepackag ed purchase of Edison after the bankruptcy occurs We will continue to inv estigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available It is also rumored that if an inadequate bill passes ie one that wil l not return SoCal to creditworthiness SoCal may declare voluntary bankru ptcy then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy The only requirement laid upon SoCal is to attempt to go back into the m arket by January and there is no penalty for them failing to do so There appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them fr om using money from the bailout in bankruptcy

October the longterm relationship between DSIs and BPA for preferred rates will end as Bonneville Power Administrations new rate case takes effect After DSIs become discretionary customers of Bonneville Power Administration DSIs have been playing the game of slowly migrating their load to local utilities in mW annual increments to avoid being subject to Bonnevilles New Large Single Load NLSL designation and losing their preferred rate status Now they are beginning to slip quietly back onto BPAs federal system and officials at Bonneville have been willing partners in attempting to circumvent their own NLSL regulations which were established in In an effort to secure existing DSI relationships BPA is now undertaking a review of its NLSL regulation to provide an exemption for these companies BPA is opposed by the Public Power Council the representative of the public utilities in the Pacific Northwest that focuses BPA ratemaking which has sent a letter to the Assistant Secretary of Energy to express its objections to BPAs proposed actions The PPC was instrumental in raising public awareness earlier this year about the favored status of the DSIs as large industrial customers they are moving aggressively to block BPA from giving the aluminum smelters any additional favored treatment The ability of BPA to exempt DSIs from its NLSL regulation will shape the direction of negotiations between aluminum smelters and other power producers in the region It remains to be seen whether or not the Public Power Council will initiate a legal battle to stop the DSIs from obtaining this special treatment While moving to maintain positive relationships with the DSIs BPA is not enthusiastic about giving power back to the smelters because they think they will need all the water they can spare for the fish BPA has concerns that supplies will be tight again in the fall and early winter they wont really benefit much even from normal or better precipitation until the melt starts next April BPA wants to buy back power from the smelters for at least a year and probably would not entertain any overtures from smelters until then About the only possibility for smelters to go back on line would be for them to use the money theyre getting from BPA to subsidize power purchases on the spot market However there would be a lot of risk in that and BPA people dont think market prices would enable them to be very profitable even with the BPA money helping As of April three smelters should come back on line NW Aluminum Goldendale Aluminum Longville Aluminum Alcoa Aluminum There is not much news happening on the negotiating end between Alcoa and BC Hydro right now Information is still fairly tightlipped however employees of Alcoas idled Intalco smelter have been shifted to other capital projects in the facility to prepare the plant for an eventual restart This may indicate the direction of negotiations Kaiser Aluminum As odd man out Kaiser has little to say in Northwestern energy developments The company will obviously benefit if Bonneville is able to fight off the public utilities but they are in such a weak bargaining position right now that they might have to restart operations just to get revenues moving again though there is no direct evidence to support this view at this time British Columbia Politics BC Government The latest news from British Columbia is that the BC Liberal government is doing quite nicely in implementing its conservative strategy Public opinion remains quite high and they have virtually completed all of their campaign promises for the first day period Even former NDP legislators are surprised at the efficiency with which the government is proceeding Political strategists are watching the ANWR vote in the US very carefully not only because it will have a major impact on the natural gas and oil pipeline going through Northern BC but also because it is illustrating the environment vs labor fallout In the recent election the Green Party of British Columbia performed surprisingly well garnering around of the vote in any typical race contributing directly to the downfall of the NDP Premier Gordon Campbells core review of BC Government is due by October and it appears that the process will be primarily a costcutting measure They are moving to reduce expenditures which for BC Hydros sake will include community outreach student scholarship and any other feel good programs currently being undertaken by Hydro The real longterm policy planning however is expected to take place in January when Campbells team Brenda Eaton the Deputy Premiere Doug Allen the Premieres consultant and Jack Ebbels Deputy Energy Minister works in conjunction with Neufeld to construct BCs longterm energy plan BC Hydro BC Hydro has formally signed on as a participant in the RTO West regional transmission organization as a filing utility RTO West is currently being overseen by the Western Governors Association and developed as allowed by FERC RTO West will be the oversight entity in the western states and Canada that will manage electricity transmission issues We are also expecting Alberta to come on board RTO West shortly With regard to a potential rate hearing BC Hydro has recently put a freeze on rates in the province that will last until The word on this move is that it will allow Chairman Bell to generate some political cover as he begins to shave off parts of the business such as transmission and information technology focusing BC Hydros core operations on additional generation exportstrading and delivery The public concern over privatization is that it will cause rates to skyrocket similar to what happened in California but Bell has moved to head off these concerns with the rate freeze As a function of increasing BC Hydros generation capacity they are looking very carefully at building on two sites Site C hydroelectric dam and Burrard Thermal BPA Financial Status In what was expected to be a quiet period in rates matters BPA dropped a bombshell by announcing it was considering triggering the FB CRAC on October This would increase rates over the LB CRAC rate increase announced earlier despite forecasts that such an increase would be unnecessary What this essentially does is allow BPA to bypass its initial rate case increase of utilizing a stopgap measure under federal regulations BPA cited a number of reasons why it was considering imposing an FB CRAC including losses trading power this summer changes in the accounting treatment of some DSI buyouts and uncertainty whether the California ISO and PX can pay monies owed BPA BPA did note however that it also had more than one hundred million additional dollars in bond refinancing money not accounted in the FB CRAC calculation If the FB CRAC triggers by any amount BPA would have the option of truing up its calculation of the FB CRAC in March and could change the rates again if BPAs actual financial condition on September differs from what is estimated now or if BPA changes its accounting assumptions further BPA representatives suggest strongly that there is a good chance that a rate increase would be announced early and also indicated that the specific number would be much less than the earlier loadbased CRAC increase of about much less than and probably much much less than The Public Power Council staff has written to and met with Steve Wright BPA Acting Administrator in an effort to convince BPA that a FC CRAC is unnecessary We should know BPAs decision by August FERC Refunds At this time BPA will not seek refunds in the ongoing FERC proceedings or submit to the process for purposes of others seeking refunds against BPAfor the following reasons BPA believes FERC lacks jurisdiction over BPA The proceedings are so convoluted and the transactions so complicated that BPA asserts that there is no realistic hope of unwinding all of the transactions necessary to equitably order refunds Insofar as other parties collecting against BPA in some cases BPA was only the remarketing agent acting at the behest of for example aluminum smelters FERC would have to proceed against these third parties and often that money has already been spent With respect to claims by the Calif DWR million a similar claim in the separate California FERC proceeding was disallowed on June It would be incongruous to allow the claim here In this claim FERC denied DWR access to refunds in situations where there was a willing buyer and willing seller Then there are the assorted politics involved First BPA believes that the political costs of pursuing refunds outweigh any eventual benefit that might be received BPA calculates its potential exposure in these refund proceedings at circa million while it believes its own potential claims could amount to millionthus a potential million net gain For reasons cited however we believe it highly unlikely they will seek refunds Second with respect to others seeking refunds against BPA five NW senators who sit on the Senate Energy Committee would be very upset if FERC allowed California parties to collect against BPA and FERC to some extent is likely to be responsive to this sentiment BPA is confident of its legal position in this matter estimating less than a chance of their being forced to submit to FERC in this matter Of course if they were forced to submit to FERC jurisdiction they would cross claim against other parties and seek refunds Even if BPA received refunds we do not believe that it would affect the ability of aluminum smelters to come back online We anticipate that on April three smelters amounting to between MW will come back on line Northwest Aluminum Goldendale Aluminum MW and Longville Aluminum MW SpillRelated

Edison MOU A snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome Procedural Scenarios Assembly The Assembly Appropriations Committees plan to take up SB XX today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full Assembly on a party line vote While the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of Fridays draft bill it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend If the problematic Shaver Lake provisions are removed from the bill Assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition If the Shaver Lake amendments remain several Central Valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal and the business community supports some recent amendments This likely mitigates concerns from other probusiness Democrats With or without the Shaver Lake provisions Hertzberg should get at least Democratic members and probably a few more but no more than Republicans if any to vote Aye on the bill Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus he needs votes for the bill to pass and there are Democrats in his caucus If the vote is close a personal plea from him andor the Governor should enable him to get to Senate The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assemblys amendments This is where the prognosticating gets difficult Senate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB xx Gov Davis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed due to a variety of factors and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position This would lead to one of four scenarios Burton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept th Burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition this option is unlikely Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill as it is passed by the Assembly for a vote in the full Senate with his support Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments and another vote in the Assembly before a vote in the Senate John Burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move Additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result For instance the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way eg workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment Foretelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult But Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given Burtons past actions he may string them along holding out for several days maybe even until Sept th before he agrees to anything Governor Assuming the bill escapes the Senate and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes the Governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of Edisons public position The bill will go into effect days after the Governor signs it Consumer groups have vowed to undo any Edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box That could be either an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB xx and replacing it with other provisions or a referendum to repeal SB xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all Initiative Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General it takes days to receive an official title and summary and another days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary After either the or days the Attorney General sends it to the proponents the Senate the Assembly and the Secretary of State The day it is mailed is called the Summary Date That is the day upon which all calculations are made The proponents are allowed a maximum of days to circulate petitions and collect signatures However the initiative measure must qualify at least days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters Therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on March statewide primaries and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on November However the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September to qualify for November The legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it So whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot An initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election signatures The ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers It seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights has been successful at placing proconsumer initiatives on the ballot before including Prop in which sought to undo AB before the public understood its ramifications Referendum Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives although a successful referendum was on the March ballot Prior to that the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June primary election ballot All four were defeated Since there have been approximately attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot Of the attempts qualified for the ballot of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect The circulation calendar verification timing and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives For example the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred The signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute though Political Dynamics Notwithstanding the Governors and Assembly Speakers desire to enact an Edison rescue package Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the drivers seat In fact as noted above there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around One business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout In fact members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility their reluctance fed by generators lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout Currently due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue there are not votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly We believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence and the bill will pass the Assembly As difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly the state Senate presents an even larger challenge However at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than percent

of Direct Access DWR Rate Agreement Californias Assembly Rallies Round a New MOU The lights were burning late in the California Capitol last night as lawmak ers in the Democratic caucus volleyed final versions of the newly consolida ted Edison MOU bill AB Details leaked to the public concentrate on dis putes over the valuation of SoCals transmission line assets however sour ces report this matter is only a prelude to even greater contentious langua ge buried in the bills various sub clauses Earlier media reports noting that the bill would be based on Senator Burtons preferred legislation are also far off the mark The draft bill tries to get the State out of the po wer business as fast as possible and binds power users to decades of high p rices The proposed language also significantly reduces the chance of a So Cal Ed bankruptcy and provides the company with lavish concessions SoCal Ed is complaining about some technical details in public but the draft bil l offers probably the most generous deal any electricity utility has seen f rom regulators Sacramento insiders tell us the bill has a pretty good ch ance of passing in the next days but could touch off a political and legal storm because of its draconian impact on Californian power users The Assemblys AB contains three primary additions that distinguish it f rom thee Senates SB XX bill and The Governor and Assembly Democrats propose to charge a massive exit fee to any end user wanting to switch a future alternative power providers All California electricity users will be liable for the cost of Governor Davis expensive longterm power contracts for their whole term save muni cipalities like SMUD and LADWP This is apparently the only acceptable co mpromise for legislators that would both secure revenue to cover the State s longterm power costs and maintain the promise of direct access establish ed at the onset of Californias deregulation The clause sidesteps some of the obstacles the California State Constitution places in the way of stopp ing direct access particularly for municipalities But it could still be open to legal challenge California officials hope that it will be enough to quiet the issue until the October power bond sale is finalized The Assembly expanded the rate base of commercial class users to pay back SoCals bailout bonds by incorporating small businesses that use k W It appears likely that this change was made because SP told the state that a larger rate base would be needed to support the bailout bonds SP wants all ratepayers to help repay and secure the bailout bonds including small businesses This change is likely to draw heavy fire from the powerf ul California Technology and Manufacturers Alliance CTMA The PUC will be mandated to set rates at any level necessary to preser ve SoCal Edisons solvency and borrowing ability This regulation essentia lly links consumer electricity rates with maintaining SoCals investment gr ade credit rating Arguably SoCal would need to do little more than make a case that that SP might downgrade them and the CPUC would necessarily re spond with a rate increase If SoCal can get this concession the nickel an d dimes issue of transmission line valuation will be muted a promising sig n to those fearing bankruptcy Sources within the Sacramento Capitol inform us that the Governor and Hertz berg are likely to get their way for now The precise wording of the clause s may be toyed with in the final markup session but we understand there is considerable momentum behind the substance There are some indications th at the Governor may have overestimated the amount of support AB has in th e Assembly Republicans are not on board so if the bill passes it will be subject to days delay before taking effect It remains unclear whether the plan will come to a vote next week Whenif the plan does pass it wi ll likely have no more than a chance of escaping the Senate Senator B urton the consumer advocates and the CTMA are staunchly against any plan that would include small businesses in paying off SoCals bailout bonds S en Minority leader Burlte told several lobbyists yesterday that the Republ icans would walk away from any amended SB XX that emerged in the House h aving already agreed to the Sher bill SB XX before the recess This is reportedly the same attitude Brultes counterpart in the Senate John Burto n has articulated and not a good sign for Edison Direct Access Contrary to the CPUCs press release explaining their decision to delay the direct access ruling to allow more time to review the case sources report the reason for the delay is that the Commission prefers to wait for the Le gislature to act on SB XX bond repayment before ruling Key business c ommunity leaders expect the PUC to formally end direct access on Sept H owever the Legislature has the authority to reinstate direct access in wha tever form it may choose Presuming the PUC carries out the expected action and permanently suspends direct access the following are some possible outcomes The Legislature under pressure from a unified business community coul d restore direct access before the end of the session allowing moderate Dem ocrats in swing districts to say they protected the economic climate but o nly with exit fees and time commitment restrictions that are unpalatable to businesses Many in the business community are willing to accept having to eat a DWR surcharge for longterm power contract commitments and a surch arge to pay for a substantial portion of Edisons accumulated debt But acc ording to our sources Legislative Democrats are insisting on exit fees sub stantially beyond these surcharges to head off the need for additional resi dential rate increases that might be needed to satisfy DWR commitments If this occurs or if the Legislature simply stands idle and declines t o restore direct access business leaders may likely give up on direct acce ss and shift their efforts to restructuring the rate allocation to shift a greater portion of the burden to the residential ratepayer classes The Ma rch rate increase by the PUC placed a disproportionate share of the revenue requirement burden on the industrial ratepayer classes This would presen t a huge political challenge But because the amount of net short power exp ected to be available for direct access agreements is so small one estim ate places it at no more than MW or about of demand through there is growing sentiment in the business community that it is no long er really worth fighting for direct access given the political obstacles Additionally there is the interesting prospect that DWR itself might e xpand and dominate the market for net short power sales given the agencys expected surplus supply via the forward contracts There is nothing in law or regulation currently that would prevent DWR from acting as a market par ticipant and selling excess power indeed DWR already sells excess power t o municipal utilities private utilities and power managers outside Califor nia DWR Rate Agreement and Edison Rescue In the Senate informational hearing today on the DWR rate agreement DWR re presentatives acknowledged that the agency is still negotiating contracts f or additional forward power This prompted concern by some legislators and consumer activists who believe DWR has already overpurchased long term po wer causing sales by DWR of excess power for as little as per MW at tim es this summer

Hertzberg reportedly had votes in favor of the bailout that he could count on There were more votes that were close and stood a reasonable chance of being cast in favor of the bailo ut However that still left Hertzberg votes short of the he needs Earlier today Sen Polanco the bills sponsor privately indicated that t he few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended SB XX were in place due to lobbying efforts by Gov Davis No doubt the count will be close b ut Hertzberg will only take the bill up in the Assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows Democrats can muster enough support The key issues related to getting the votes to pass SB XX are the foll owing Including the option to buy the transmission lines For some this is a phi losophical issue these members are quite adamant that the option to buy th e lines needs to be removed from SB XX Excess profits and creditworthiness In particular how Edison can use any profits The philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necess ary given the experience with PGE And members are skittish about voting for a bailout with the possibility of a bankruptcy still possible anyway According to Assembly leadership sources no Senator has asked the Speaker s Office for anything to be put in the bill except for a Central Valley se nator Jim Costa who played a party in brokering the deal on Shaver Lake Leadership sources were surprised by that and believe that many senators will not hold to the Burton line of dont even change a period in the bil l Several senators including Polanco and Costa are vested in the bills passage and will want to see it brought up for a vote despite significant o pposition Many people including Polanco believe that Burton may require his worker s compensation reform plan to be doublejoined to the Edison MOU in order t o take it up for a vote Double joining is a legislative maneuver that tie s the fate of both bills together It creates a situation where both must be passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in order to go into effect If the Governor only signs one neither becomes law But the Gov ernors office has told us that Burton made a direct statement to them last week that he had no intention to double join workers comp reform to SB x x Some suggest that Senate opposition lead by Burton which remains considera ble may introduce a new bailout bill if SB XX passes the Assembly This new bill would be designed to be unacceptable to the Assembly The Senate then would pass this bill on the last day of the session and then adjourn without a conference committee The Assembly would then be left to accept or reject the Senates bill without the possibility of amendments This is somewhat similar to what the Senate did in July only now the recess wil l be until next year SoCal Bailout Barriers Regarding media reports referencing Assemblyman Keelys deal with Davis to exempt acres of the Shaver Lake area from the bills conservation eas ements the protesters representing Fresno feel that this is not good enoug h and they intend to pursue their lawsuit against the state regarding the e asements These protestors and the Republicans who represent them felt t hat they had achieved compromise language in the bailout last week but thi s language is now gone While the Shaver Lake amendments and all conserva tion easement language are again in the bill we do not believe this will significantly interfere with the bills passage Some Central Valley membe rs voted in support of the bill despite the amendments and there is only o ne Democrat Dean Florez who may vote against it because of them Some Senators also reportedly considering removing language from the bond p ortion of the bailout bill that makes the bonds Harveyproof that is i mmune from a referendum by consumer advocates This language which was pr eviously used in the California rate reduction bonds is structured such th at Californias credit could be compromised if the bonds are not repaid th is is done by involving the California Infrastructure Bank as a party to th e bonds Some members of the Senate who are in close contact with Harvey Rosenfield and the consumer advocates have expressed that they want to remo ve this language as a diplomatic way to destroy the bailout If the langua ge is removed there is no way that the states credit is tied to the bonds This means that the bonds can be challenged by a voter referendum withou t endangering the state Current polls show that such a referendum which would allow voters to choose not to pay the surcharge on power bills to bai l out SoCal would very likely succeed This would mean that the bonds cou ld not be repaid Wall Street firms have stated expressly that they will not purchase the bon ds if they are susceptible to a voter referendum meaning that removing the Harveyproofing language will likely mean that the bailout bonds will no t be able to be sold SoCal is also aware of this possibility if the lang uage comes out of the bill the plan will no longer be acceptable to SoCal SoCal Selling Out or Going Under There is word in Sacramento of companies sniffing around for a prepackag ed purchase of Edison after the bankruptcy occurs We will continue to inv estigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available It is also rumored that if an inadequate bill passes ie one that wil l not return SoCal to creditworthiness SoCal may declare voluntary bankru ptcy then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy The only requirement laid upon SoCal is to attempt to go back into the m arket by January and there is no penalty for them failing to do so There appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them fr om using money from the bailout in bankruptcy

Edison MOU A snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome Procedural Scenarios Assembly The Assembly Appropriations Committees plan to take up SB XX today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full Assembly on a party line vote While the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of Fridays draft bill it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend If the problematic Shaver Lake provisions are removed from the bill Assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition If the Shaver Lake amendments remain several Central Valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal and the business community supports some recent amendments This likely mitigates concerns from other probusiness Democrats With or without the Shaver Lake provisions Hertzberg should get at least Democratic members and probably a few more but no more than Republicans if any to vote Aye on the bill Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus he needs votes for the bill to pass and there are Democrats in his caucus If the vote is close a personal plea from him andor the Governor should enable him to get to Senate The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assemblys amendments This is where the prognosticating gets difficult Senate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB xx Gov Davis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed due to a variety of factors and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position This would lead to one of four scenarios Burton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept th Burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition this option is unlikely Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill as it is passed by the Assembly for a vote in the full Senate with his support Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments and another vote in the Assembly before a vote in the Senate John Burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move Additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result For instance the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way eg workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment Foretelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult But Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given Burtons past actions he may string them along holding out for several days maybe even until Sept th before he agrees to anything Governor Assuming the bill escapes the Senate and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes the Governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of Edisons public position The bill will go into effect days after the Governor signs it Consumer groups have vowed to undo any Edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box That could be either an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB xx and replacing it with other provisions or a referendum to repeal SB xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all Initiative Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General it takes days to receive an official title and summary and another days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary After either the or days the Attorney General sends it to the proponents the Senate the Assembly and the Secretary of State The day it is mailed is called the Summary Date That is the day upon which all calculations are made The proponents are allowed a maximum of days to circulate petitions and collect signatures However the initiative measure must qualify at least days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters Therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on March statewide primaries and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on November However the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September to qualify for November The legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it So whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot An initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election signatures The ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers It seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights has been successful at placing proconsumer initiatives on the ballot before including Prop in which sought to undo AB before the public understood its ramifications Referendum Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives although a successful referendum was on the March ballot Prior to that the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June primary election ballot All four were defeated Since there have been approximately attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot Of the attempts qualified for the ballot of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect The circulation calendar verification timing and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives For example the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred The signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute though Political Dynamics Notwithstanding the Governors and Assembly Speakers desire to enact an Edison rescue package Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the drivers seat In fact as noted above there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around One business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout In fact members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility their reluctance fed by generators lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout Currently due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue there are not votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly We believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence and the bill will pass the Assembly As difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly the state Senate presents an even larger challenge However at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than percent

Democrats With or without the Shaver Lake provisions Hertzberg should get at least Democratic members and probably a few more but no more than Republicans if any to vote Aye on the bill Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus he needs votes for the bill to pass and there are Democrats in his caucus If the vote is close a personal plea from him andor the Governor should enable him to get to Senate The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assemblys amendments This is where the prognosticating gets difficult Senate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB xx Gov Davis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed due to a variety of factors and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position This would lead to one of four scenarios Burton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept th Burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition this option is unlikely Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill as it is passed by the Assembly for a vote in the full Senate with his support Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments and another vote in the Assembly before a vote in the Senate John Burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move Additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result For instance the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way eg workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment Foretelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult But Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given Burtons past actions he may string them along holding out for several days maybe even until Sept th before he agrees to anything Governor Assuming the bill escapes the Senate and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes the Governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of Edisons public position The bill will go into effect days after the Governor signs it Consumer groups have vowed to undo any Edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box That could be either an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB xx and replacing it with other provisions or a referendum to repeal SB xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all Initiative Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General it takes days to receive an official title and summary and another days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary After either the or days the Attorney General sends it to the proponents the Senate the Assembly and the Secretary of State The day it is mailed is called the Summary Date That is the day upon which all calculations are made The proponents are allowed a maximum of days to circulate petitions and collect signatures However the initiative measure must qualify at least days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters Therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on March statewide primaries and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on November However the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September to qualify for November The legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it So whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot An initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election signatures The ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers It seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights has been successful at placing proconsumer initiatives on the ballot before including Prop in which sought to undo AB before the public understood its ramifications Referendum Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives although a successful referendum was on the March ballot Prior to that the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June primary election ballot All four were defeated Since there have been approximately attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot Of the attempts qualified for the ballot of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect The circulation calendar verification timing and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives For example the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred The signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute though Political Dynamics Notwithstanding the Governors and Assembly Speakers desire to enact an Edison rescue package Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the drivers seat In fact as noted above there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around One business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout In fact members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility their reluctance fed by generators lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout Currently due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue there are not votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly We believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence and the bill will pass the Assembly As difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly the state Senate presents an even larger challenge However at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than percent

night Assemblyman Hertzberg reportedly had votes in favor of the bailout that he could count on There were more votes that were close and stood a reasonable chance of being cast in favor of the bailo ut However that still left Hertzberg votes short of the he needs Earlier today Sen Polanco the bills sponsor privately indicated that t he few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended SB XX were in place due to lobbying efforts by Gov Davis No doubt the count will be close b ut Hertzberg will only take the bill up in the Assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows Democrats can muster enough support The key issues related to getting the votes to pass SB XX are the foll owing Including the option to buy the transmission lines For some this is a phi losophical issue these members are quite adamant that the option to buy th e lines needs to be removed from SB XX Excess profits and creditworthiness In particular how Edison can use any profits The philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necess ary given the experience with PGE And members are skittish about voting for a bailout with the possibility of a bankruptcy still possible anyway According to Assembly leadership sources no Senator has asked the Speaker s Office for anything to be put in the bill except for a Central Valley se nator Jim Costa who played a party in brokering the deal on Shaver Lake Leadership sources were surprised by that and believe that many senators will not hold to the Burton line of dont even change a period in the bil l Several senators including Polanco and Costa are vested in the bills passage and will want to see it brought up for a vote despite significant o pposition Many people including Polanco believe that Burton may require his worker s compensation reform plan to be doublejoined to the Edison MOU in order t o take it up for a vote Double joining is a legislative maneuver that tie s the fate of both bills together It creates a situation where both must be passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in order to go into effect If the Governor only signs one neither becomes law But the Gov ernors office has told us that Burton made a direct statement to them last week that he had no intention to double join workers comp reform to SB x x Some suggest that Senate opposition lead by Burton which remains considera ble may introduce a new bailout bill if SB XX passes the Assembly This new bill would be designed to be unacceptable to the Assembly The Senate then would pass this bill on the last day of the session and then adjourn without a conference committee The Assembly would then be left to accept or reject the Senates bill without the possibility of amendments This is somewhat similar to what the Senate did in July only now the recess wil l be until next year SoCal Bailout Barriers Regarding media reports referencing Assemblyman Keelys deal with Davis to exempt acres of the Shaver Lake area from the bills conservation eas ements the protesters representing Fresno feel that this is not good enoug h and they intend to pursue their lawsuit against the state regarding the e asements These protestors and the Republicans who represent them felt t hat they had achieved compromise language in the bailout last week but thi s language is now gone While the Shaver Lake amendments and all conserva tion easement language are again in the bill we do not believe this will significantly interfere with the bills passage Some Central Valley membe rs voted in support of the bill despite the amendments and there is only o ne Democrat Dean Florez who may vote against it because of them Some Senators also reportedly considering removing language from the bond p ortion of the bailout bill that makes the bonds Harveyproof that is i mmune from a referendum by consumer advocates This language which was pr eviously used in the California rate reduction bonds is structured such th at Californias credit could be compromised if the bonds are not repaid th is is done by involving the California Infrastructure Bank as a party to th e bonds Some members of the Senate who are in close contact with Harvey Rosenfield and the consumer advocates have expressed that they want to remo ve this language as a diplomatic way to destroy the bailout If the langua ge is removed there is no way that the states credit is tied to the bonds This means that the bonds can be challenged by a voter referendum withou t endangering the state Current polls show that such a referendum which would allow voters to choose not to pay the surcharge on power bills to bai l out SoCal would very likely succeed This would mean that the bonds cou ld not be repaid Wall Street firms have stated expressly that they will not purchase the bon ds if they are susceptible to a voter referendum meaning that removing the Harveyproofing language will likely mean that the bailout bonds will no t be able to be sold SoCal is also aware of this possibility if the lang uage comes out of the bill the plan will no longer be acceptable to SoCal SoCal Selling Out or Going Under There is word in Sacramento of companies sniffing around for a prepackag ed purchase of Edison after the bankruptcy occurs We will continue to inv estigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available It is also rumored that if an inadequate bill passes ie one that wil l not return SoCal to creditworthiness SoCal may declare voluntary bankru ptcy then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy The only requirement laid upon SoCal is to attempt to go back into the m arket by January and there is no penalty for them failing to do so There appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them fr om using money from the bailout in bankruptcy
