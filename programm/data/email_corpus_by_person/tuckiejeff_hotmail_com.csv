memorable I have met so many cool people over here and seen so many awesome places Since the time of my last writing I spent five days sailing around the Mediterranean with six other auzzies and kiwis The boat wasnt very full and we had four crew members to ensure the seven of us were adequately fed and rested Morning started with breakfast and was followed by long spells of sleeping reading and swimming It reminded me alot of Torys cabin except I didnt have to cook or clean the dishes Tory work on it It was difficult to get off the boat and the group spent several days afterwards laying around and doing next to nothing to ease ourselves back into the real world After the sailing we spent four days in this awesome little town called Fethiye and visited places such as the blue lagoon and hiked up to a waterfall in the Valley of the Butterflys We also went to a hike in this gorge that was completely incredible At this point in the holiday I was quite happy for the lax safety standards over here because we climbed up many places in the gorge using nothing but the old ropes that someone had conveniently tied in place In one spot we even had to climb vertically up a rope through a small waterfall I was quite pumped to head to this place called Olympos where they have these treehouses to sleep in but let the others go a day ahead while I finished my stuff in Fethiye When I got to Olympos there wasnt much to do and one of the guys was pretty sick so I only stayed the evening and we carried on to the next place In hindsight my decision to arrive late and leave early was a good one because I was the only one of the seven who didnt end up getting really ill whew We spent several days in this quant little village in the middle of the country waiting for everyone to get better to travel then headed to this place called Cappadocia where they have these awesome hoodoo type rocks everywhere After arriving I went exploring some really old churches carved into these rocks with a couple of girls from the hostel On the way home we decided that hitchin would be easier than waiting for the bus and met some really nice turkish men who were looking for a couple of nice women After several detours and a long journey we were able to talk them into taking us back into town Last time I hitchhike in Turkey The next day I headed off to explore the valley with the group of people from the sailboat We got lost for a while and found an awesome house carved into this rock kinda like a cavehouse It was many stories high and we went exploring and ended up on the roof of the house which was at the top of the valley I also got to sleep in one of these caves at the pansion where I was staying which was quite a treat considering the caves are quite cool and it was smoking hot outside The next day we went to take a tour that we had arranged through another hotel and ended up getting pulled over by the Jandarma Turkeys version of the special police force Turns out that our guide wasnt certified and that we werent supposed to be with him After a while of waiting and some discussion we were driven back to town and refunded our money We ended up finding another guide and toured an underground city saw some thousand year old churches and saw where they filmed some scenes of the first starwars Our final day in Cappadocia and one I will never forget was quite scary After a long hard night of partying in the Flintstones Cave Bar for my sendoff party the others were going another direction and I was heading to Istanbul we got up and decided to go for a hike down this place called the pigeon valley There were five of us including two other auzzies that we had met the day before four girls and one guy We hiked down this valley and ended up coming to a very steep section that we had to climb down It wasnt very safe and we were all pretty worried but figured it was the only way down The girl was crouching on this thin trail and slipped She ended up sliding down this rockysandy slope about twenty five feet on her belly and managed to stop herself on the edge of a thirty foot cliff all while the rest of us watched in horror A turkish guide had just shown up before she slipped and he helped to get her back up an to safety Myself and another guy ended up climbing back up the rest of the cliff we were only partway down and found another turkish guide who led us down an easier way She was pretty shaken up and had taken all of the skin off her elbows knees and finger tips trying to gain a hold We got her back to town and spent several hours cleaning her up The two of them then came with me to Istanbul and hopped on a plane back to London Very crazy The last couple of days I have been in Istanbul and have seen the Royal palace several really old mosques and some amazing jewels if you like carat diamonds and the bones of St John the Baptiste I am going to tour again tomorrow and maybe shop a little then head back home to Calgary Will see you all then Take Care Jeff Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp
<4033483.1075841219779.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tuckiejeff@hotmail.com,2001-07-04 10:19:04,TurkeyPST A little summary of my travels so far After several emails back to myself I believe I have figured out how to use this keyboard and the writing s hopefully readable The poor grammar cannot be blamed on the keyboard though On the plane over here I met a turkish girl who used to be an english teacher and hence spoke very good english I ended up staying at her place my first night in Turkey she was going to give me a ride to my hotel but did not want to venture into the area in which the hotel was booked dont trust everything you read on the internet The plane got in very late and I had not slept at all and was very tired A nice muslim priest decided to serenade me at am from the mosque just down the hill and my attempt at sleep ended Turns out muslims must pray five times a day and the mosques blare out prayers to ensure that you dont forget We had breakfast on the bosphorus the following morning where I was able to learn a little bit about the traffic laws in Turkey We were eating across the street from a police station on a one way road yet that didnt stop anyone from driving the wrong way down the one way They drive like maniacs here and are encouraged as far as I can tell The traffic lights in the towns actually have a countdown timer on them and the light goes from red to yellow to green just like at a racetrack Go figure I got on a bus to head south and learned several things about Turkish culture and myself First very few turkish speak english I had kinda assumed that they all spoke english after taking to an english teacher on the plane secondly I cant speak Turkish After a while I managed to write down where I wanted to go and found someone to point me in the proper direction The buses here are awesome they give you coffee and tea cookies and some lemon smelling stuff to put on your hands Partway through the trip some army guys got on the bus and a guy with a big machine gun came and sat down beside me He stunk but I was not about to tell him so I spent my first day touring the battlefields of Galipolli with several Australians and New Zealanders The tourguide was awesome and the site was really neat although very few Canadians fought there I got back on a bus that evening and traveled to a town down south I met some New Yorkers on the bus and they made me question my decision to go to school n the US One of the girls had no clue where Calgary was until I explained to here that it was just north of Montana it was the typical Speak American Please On Saturday I toured the ancient ruins at Pergamum which are located above the town of Bergama on top of a huge hill I decided after touring that I would walk back to town about k wearing my big backpack n C heat After walking all the way down the hill I got to the barbwire topped fence surrounding the ruins I felt like an idiot but there was no way I was climbing back up the hill There were several young local guys running down the road and I asked them for help There only suggestion was to jump the fence explained by hand signals because they spoke little english and I figured it was worth a try I managed to get over the barbwire with my backpack and only cut up my knee a little bit They walked back to the village with me and wanted me to pay for them to go to the other historical sites I think I took off faster than having being chased by an angry old man after snowballing cars and hopped on the next bus out of town Sunday I toured the ruins of Ephesus which were really neat and saw an old roman theater that Elton John had played in April Sunday I went up to the travertines at Pamukale one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World The hillside is covered with calcium deposits and there is water running down which collects in these pools where you were once allowed to swim no longer because they were being destroyed Today I am sitting in a port town called Bodrum and have just finished touring a ancient castle and am heading to the mausoleum another of the seven wonders Following this I am going to go to Marmaris and get on a sailboat tomorrow for a four day trip around many small islands in the Mediterranean Sea Hope all is well in Calgary and will keep you all up to date through my journeys Jeff Get Your Private Free Email from MSN Hotmail at
