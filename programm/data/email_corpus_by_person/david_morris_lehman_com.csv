data so far this quarter has been extremely ambiguous On the one hand the employment figures released last Friday were soft with net hiring shrinking for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate rising to On the other hand consumer sentiment has improved and the April retail sales figures were stronger than anticipated As we have mentioned this mixed data has increased the odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only bp next Tuesday At this stage Lehman Brothers economists still think the odds favor a bp cut given the underlying weakness in the economy particularly in hightech and manufacturing together with the abysmal employment data The change in the perception on the strength of the economy can be seen in the higher interest rates posted below The year US TBond

turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle which commences May with presentations from the major Networks lasting through May The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market Ad buyers must be careful not to look at the current economic environment as a proxy for the future Based on this premise there may be upside to our estimated decline in upfront sales based on inventory sales with low to mid single digit price increases In our opinion VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this years upfront given that improved ratings in the key demographic combined with our

Today we thought that we would repeat some of the comments made by Jeff Applegate Lehman Brothers US Investment Strategist this morning In summary Jeff reiterates that a turning point in the earnings cycle is at hand and this along with attractive valuation and accommodative policy should help propel the market to the yearend SP price target In fact late on Thursday the market received some unaccustomed news that being that bellwether networking firm Cisco Systems was seeing signs of its business conditions stabilizing The US stock market showed us on Friday that a little evidence of corporate business stability could go a long way towards leading the market higher As Jeff says Indeed the broader stock market reaction confirmed that it is still discounting deep reservations around the prospects for an earnings recovery in the quarters ahead Despite the rally on Friday Jeff still feels that the market closed percent below Lehmans fair value on forward PE ratio model Just when

conditions appear stronger in Blackrock and PFPC than PNC Advisors The pace of share repurchase activity should accelerate in H for the following reasons PNC has a substantial amount of excess capital it is generating lots of free capital flow it has mm shares remaining to repurchase under its existing authorization and there does not appear to be any large acquisitions requiring capital in the

sector following lean years It appears to be a good time to revisit out thesis and reexamine some of the conclusions to see if they still stand up months later and if they are relevant for the next

from B to B EPS from to FY revs from B to B and EPS from to Sun believes that this is not a company specific issue and that all computer hardware vendors are having difficulties IT demand is significantly lower than weeks ago and deterioration in the global economy has affected sales cycles and the ability to close deals in the pipeline The macro issues in the US seem to be spreading to

the outlook for natural prices as well as EP share prices because of growing natural gas supply combined with weak natural gas demand We believe that the average EP stock fairly discounts a longterm natural gas price forecast of about MMBtu but with the September gas contract falling as much as to MMBtu yesterday we believe that nearterm stock price performance is likely to be negative Investors

contribution as immaterial to our model Paper Forest Products P Ruschmeier MEAW Merger Bullish For Consolidation Trend We recommend aggressive purchase of MEA Strong Buy and W Buy as the announced combination between the companies should create an estimated BB per proforma share of shareholder value The deal also supports our Strong Buy on SPP and our Buy rating on BOW Technical selling related to hedges on long positions of MEA and W is possible on numerous largecap companies such as IP WY and GP but we view technical weakness as a buying opportunity for fundamental investors The MEAW combo should create BB of value X synergies of MM or per proforma share Nonstrategic asset sales are likely and we estimate rationalization of at least K tons US supply of coated paper capacity We estimate only a probability the deal is broken up Gaming Lodging J Minor Lodging Industry RevPAR Falls Further in July Yesterday Smith Travel Research released July lodging industry data showing RevPAR declined further in July down worse than the decline of June The upper upscale segment where most public companies are concentrated was down vs in June While most lodging companies expected Q RevPAR results to be slightly below Q levels this is not an auspicious start to Q With numbers like this its hard for us to say you have to own the lodging stocks But we still expect our downward earnings revisions will be less painful than the SPs overall which should allow continued outperformance for the lodging stocks With the least downside risk Marriott remains our favorite REITs with strong safe

late edition According to Jeff Applegate Lehman Brothers strategist the prevailing bear story on the market is that the market is now lower than it was six months ago after the initial Federal Reserve interest rate cut The implication is that something must be wrong Well one thing that we do know is that earnings have been declining for the last six months However according to Jeff that does not imply that the Fed is powerless It only means that memories are short In the same situation prevailed The market was down six months after the initial interest rate cuts from the Fed and again in the market was down after the same period However Jeff does point out that on average the SP was invariably up after the initial Fed easing Given that Jeffs target by year end is only on the SP the jury is still out If the SP reached that level it would only be above the January rd level when the Fed started their easing processand that would be at the low end of the historical range The year US

odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only bp next Tuesday At this stage Lehman Brothers economists still think the odds favor a bp cut given the underlying weakness in the economy particularly in

turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle which commences May with presentations from the major Networks lasting through May The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market Ad

earnings releases we are reducing our official earnings forecasts for all of the Asset Managers in our coverage universe to reflect the dramatic reduction in the market value of equity assets under

comparable with the Brokers who recently reported their FQ ended Aug earnings we are also updating our estimates for Charles Schwab SCH Market Perform and Merrill Lynch MER Strong Buy to reflect recent globalmarket developments that have impacted them as well q These changes are consistent with comments we have made in several recent notes and should not come as a surprise to many observers as periodic estimate revisions such as these are a fact of life in this marketsensitive sector we could arguably revise earnings forecasts for some companies as often as several times a week We prefer to spend our time trying to identify unanticipated fundamental catalysts and valuation opportunities and continue to view marketdriven estimate revisions as largely reactionary and perpetually belated

Location Update Where Are We q Given the tragic events of Sept Americans are more focused on safety and communications We think the first wireless carriers to offer E capabilities could gain market share over their competitors In terms of ability to roll out services near term we rank the carriers in the following order Sprint PCS Cingular ATT Wireless Verizon Wireless VoiceStream and Nextel q No US carriers will be compliant with todays deadline for the FCCs Phase II location services mandate All have sought waivers however we think the FCC is focused more on seeing evidence that carriers are making progress on the location front rather than on the deadlines themselves q Due to the incident on Sept we would not be surprised to see an accelerated pace of contract signings as carriers seek to demonstrate their responsiveness to safety concerns Lilly Eli Charles Butler Searching for the Angles Visit to LLY Buy USD q We remain quite bullish on the long term prospects for Eli Lilly With products to file over the next three years Lilly is likely to have the best revenue and earnings appreciation in all of the pharmaceutical group q We met with senior executives of Eli Lilly last

RevPAR week ending to really ugly in Q to still pretty bad in Q in Q We assume trends bounce back against very easy comparisons to in Q and in Q This assumed trend produces painful revisions to our estimates with EBITDA down about to for most from our prior estimates and with EPS or FFOshare down to Fortunately we believe investors will eventually decide that estimates are an anomaly and irrelevant for valuation purposes While lodging stocks rebounded to varying degrees last week ended as we see additional data points suggesting a gradual recovery we expect the stocks will see further upside We see the most nearterm opportunity in MeriStar Hospitality MHX and Marriott International MAR q Total Enterprise Values TEVs have declined or so since for most companies on what we project as

to the warmer weather FGP along with its peer propane MLPs earns the bulk of its cash during the heating season from October to April Oil Gas EP Canada Thomas R Driscoll Canadian Natural Gas Insight q We estimate that Canadian natural gas production in August was or Bcfpd above yearago levels We believe that the large yearover year increase in Canadian gas production has led to rapidly rising exports to the US and has contributed to weakening natural gas prices in both the US and Canada this year q Canadian natural gas production in August fell Bcfpd from July levels to Bcfpd However this production level is or Bcfpd above yearago levels q We believe that natural gas production in Canada could be nearly above year ago levels by the end of q Production fell unusually sharp from August to December last year This decline from August to December of compared to growth of about over the same period in and flat production over the period in q We expect that the addition of over MMcfpd of additional gas from Ladyfern later this year could contribute to flattorising Canadian natural gas production over the remainder of this year Exelon Corp Daniel Ford Reiterating Our Buy Rating Buy USD

opinion an extremely wellmanaged company that has substantially improved its franchise value in recent years through initiatives to improve efficiency at the stores and lower the cost of product while making a number of accretive acquisitions Current valuation which is close to an year low does not reflect these improvements q SWY reported adjusted Q EPS of below our estimate but in line with

today It was published by a technical newsletter which we are privileged to receive When people are emotional it is difficult to envision a market environment that is opposite of what is making them so emotional in the first place Unknown We believe the market is in the early stages of repair While we may have a rally over the next few weeks we are on the lookout for a successful retest of the midSeptember lows If this were to occur we would expect to see this coincide with positive technical market readings What to do in the mean time This is the time to upgrade portfolios in anticipation of a longer term recovery The year bond yield is The year is trading at The year is trading at Spot crude oil is trading at pb Natural Gas Henry Hub is trading at pmcf IMPACT CALLS Textiles Apparel Footwear Robert Drbul Wait for the Sale q Given the current uncertain economic climate we believe that footwear and apparel vendors face a high degree of risk related to three issues probable order cancellations lower than expected reorder business and direct retail exposure through their own stores The timing of this economic downturn is coming at a very inopportune time for footwear and apparel vendors as goods have already been shipped for fallholiday All three issues will lead to excess inventory levels and in turn significant markdown exposure for all footwear and apparel vendors both at department stores and company owned retail stores q We are lowering many of our ratings to reflect both our lowered earnings expectations as well as our belief that many of the companies in our universe have further downside from current levels Overall we have reduced our average topline estimate by for and for and our average EPS estimate by in and in We have reduced our average H topline estimate by and our average H EPS estimate by Our new earnings estimates for the majority of our companies are considerably below consensus estimates and in many cases by far the lowest numbers on the street While we recognize that the stocks have already depreciated substantially we believe that there could be another leg down as earnings expectations still remain overly optimistic Chemicals Sergey Vasnetsov Reducing rating on commodity chem stocks q We have lowered our ratings on LYO from Buy to Market Perform and NCX from Strong Buy to Buy as they are the most leveraged ethylene players q We are currently maintaining our EPS estimates but plan to review them shortly q The recent attacks on the US will have significant negative effects on most industries as we forecast demand to slowdown for at least the next months q We expect chemical stocks to be negatively impacted by the volatility in oil prices and believe the upturn in the global chemical cycle will be delayed by a few quarters Cendant Corp Jeffrey Kessler Thoughts Ahead of the Financial Update Strong Buy USD q Cendant has announced that it will provide updated guidance tomorrow in a am conference call with investors Ahead of the call we try to provide a quick examination of the companys sensitivity to much lower economic activity and the difficult travel industry outlook q Avis of vehicle services and the Galileo acquisition clearly pose the greatest downside earnings risk because of their sensitivity to airline travel We see lodging of hospitality and real estate brokerage of real estate services as moderately impacted helped somewhat by their franchise models q Trading at Cendant shares seem to imply that the company will earn in assuming a x PE multiple While we will wait for managements guidance our initial thoughts are that EPS are likely to be close to the level or somewhere around Advertising Marketing Services Kevin Sullivan Valuations Still Warrant Caution q Heightened global economic uncertainty corporate profit pressures and the threat of a prolonged US military strike will continue to weigh on admarketing expenditure growth over the coming months While the global ad holding stocks have pulled back some we remain cautious on the group in the near term q We are lowering our US ad forecasts following the events of Sept th We now expect to growth in vs our prior forecast of Our projection calls for just to growth vs q Concurrently we are lowering our expectations for OMC and IPG following LBs revised forecast for WPP on Sept th q While valuations have begun to discount these developments the group is still trading at x EBITDA estimates vs historical trough forward year multiples of x in and x during the last advertising recession q Growing concerns over a global recession should limit any meaningful appreciation for the stocks in the nearterm We will be looking for signs of economic stability and improved consumerbusiness confidence before getting more aggressive around the names COMPANY INDUSTRY UPDATE Integrated Oil Jeremy Elden OPEC under pressure q Last month we asserted that commodity prices were past their peak for this cycle Since then oil prices US natural gas prices and refining margins have continued to trend down Although we expect ongoing volatility events of the last two weeks should if anything accelerate the cyclical decline This weeks OPEC gathering took much longer to reach a common position than in previous meetings highlighting rising pressures as demand and prices fall For the next year demand will be the biggest price determining factor Our analysis of history suggests this will not be as weak as recent market sentiment suggests q OPEC quotas and targets reaffirmed q Demand hit to be less than market sentiment suggests q OPEC compliance likely to improve q Oil price forecasts maintained q Prices and margins trending down Exelon Daniel F Ford CFA Reiterating Our Buy Rating Buy q Yesterday EXC signaled EPS would likely fall short of guidance due to weaker energy prices prompting a selloff since We reiterate our Buy rating and our target is which is x our revised E q We are lowering our

final orders for the unbundling rate cases of the incumbent utilities including TXU Inc American Electric Power and Reliant Energy Bank of America Henry Chip Dickson Q Preview Buy USD q We expect BAC to report Q earnings of Reflecting the more difficult operating environment we are reducing our estimate to and estimate to on a new GAAP basis With the recent exit of the auto leasing and subprime real estate BAC appears to be in the businesses it wants to be in We continue to rate BAC Buy q Management has been focusing on improving internal performance and the challenge now is to execute We expect to see another quarter of steady confidence building versus quickfixes q Net interest income should rise benefiting from greater than expected rate cuts while fee income growth should be modest q We continue to expect a challenging credit environment JP Morgan Chase Co Eileen Rooney Earnings Preview Strong Buy USD q We are lowering our Q estimate to because we expect JPM once again to have to take an equity writedown and are assuming about MM We expect a turn in the private equity business to be pushed out and therefore next years revenues should also remain well below trendline We are reducing our estimate to and estimate to on a new GAAP basis We are reducing our price target to but staying with our Strong Buy rating q The current environment weighs on JPM as on other companies because of market pressures on private banking investment banking investment management and custody and processing Our estimates reflect modest contribution from private equity weaker capital markets and higher credit costs KeyCorp Eileen Rooney Third Quarter Preview Market Perform USD q Third quarter earnings should reflect efforts to shed high risk and nonstrategic businesses We continue to rate Key Corp Market Perform with a price target q We expect KEY to report Q results of below below consensus Our and estimates are and respectively q For our operating estimate is now a reduction This assumes less balance sheet growth modestly higher credit costs and lower levels of fee income Because we expect these conditions to continue into we have lowered our estimate about and on a new GAAP basis we believe KEY will earn q Third quarter earnings should be impacted by KEYs new strategic initiatives announced in the middle of May Mercantile Bankshares Kristin Nemec Third Quarter Preview Market Perform USD q MRBK should report October th Unlike last quarter where the company prereleased lower than expected results due to a sharp bp decline in the margin we believe there will be no fireworks this qtr Market Perform q We expect the margin which was in Q to remain under pressure and drop by bps q Balance sheet trends should be mixed and we would not be surprised by a decline in loan growth to around from given the industry trend of relatively high prepayments and borrowers that are often trying to pay down lines q Fee growth should be good particularly on an annual basis with another strong qtr from mortgage banking but maybe not as high as Q q Expenses should be another strongpoint with incentive fees in the mortgage banking area potentially offset by lower directors fees in the form of deferred compensation accruals Northern Trust Eileen Rooney Earnings Preview Buy USD q Due to weak market conditions we have reduced our Q EPS estimate to which is below consensus expectations We are reducing our estimate to and reducing our estimate to due to weak market conditions We continue to rate NTRS Buy We lowered our price target to q Market conditions should restrict revenue growth in Q However operating results should be aided by flat to negative expense growth and a lower share count q Spread income should be up due to modest balance sheet expansion with a net interest margin that should be wider than the prior quarter q Assets under administration and assets under management should decline in the quarter Sky Financial Group Kristin Nemec Third Quarter Preview Market Perform USD q We have a Q EPS estimate for Sky Financial which is expected to report October th Our full year estimates are unchanged at and for and respectively We are comfortable with the attainability of this conservative EPS progression and would highlight our estimate is below consensus q We expect balance sheet trends to be largely in line with Q with loan growth with equivalent percentage growth in deposits q Expense control a historical strength at SKYF should remain tight brought about by the sale of the outofmarket brokerage operations and greater integration of the remaining nonbank subsidiaries q Along with general industry trends we would not be surprised by further upticks in NPAs to above bps and NCOs of more than bps SunTrust Banks Eileen Rooney Third Quarter Preview Buy USD q We continue to rate STI Buy with a price target We expect the company to report Q results of in line with consensus q This should be the first quarter to include the acquisition of Robertson Humphrey which was acquired during the middle of the quarter Revenues and expenses are expected to be about mm Only the optics of Q earnings should be affected Like other investment banking firms RHs revenues should be well below trend line this quarter q Third quarter results should also include approximately mm in expenses related to the attempted merger with WB US Bancorp Eileen Rooney Earnings Preview Market Perform USD q As a result of the continued economic deterioration we are lowering our and estimates Our Q estimate remains but that implies a modest contribution from the NOVA acquisition For we are lowering our estimate to anticipating a down Q For our estimate is on a new GAAP basis or on an old GAAP basis a reduction of our estimate USB remains rated Market Perform q Q results will include two months of operating performance from the recent NOVA acquisition In our model we increased credit card fees by mm employee expenses by mm amortization expense by mm and share count by mm share Q results will include a full quarter of NOVA results q The difficult market conditions should cause fee revenues from investment management investment products and investment banking to be lower in Q and into q Spread income should be up due to modest balance sheet expansion and a modest expansion in the net interest margin WestAmerica Bancorp Kristin Nemec oied Market Perform USD q Although not necessarily evident this quarter as it is a new initiative we believe WABC has effectively turned over a new leaf by beginning to push for higher loan growth through more competitive pricing than it has in the past This is important because WABCs past strategy of attaining roughly EPS growth was heavily dependent on heavy share repurchase and expense savings as opposed to top line growth q We carry a EPS estimate for WABC in Q WABC is expected to report on October This is two cents above Q and a penny ahead of consensus q We believe the quarter will demonstrate additional NIM expansion which should be the largest driver of spread income with funding costs continuing to drop faster than asset yields q Noninterest revenue and expense dynamics should be in line with prior quarters Wells Fargo Eileen Rooney Earnings Preview Strong Buy USD q Due to the deteriorating economic environment and difficult market conditions we have reduced our Q EPS estimate to and we are reducing our and estimates These reductions assume the impact of this environment on most bank results will be slower loan growth weaker to declining investment management results into early higher credit costs and even weaker private equity results The net interest margin should be modestly stronger for most We continue to rate WFC Strong Buy q We are reducing our estimate to and reducing our estimate to For WFC the estimate is on a new GAAP basis and would be about higher than an old GAAP estimate q We lowered our price target to reflecting the more difficult environment and our assumption of a higher embedded equity risk premium Allmerica Financial J Paul Newsome EPS Estimates Reduced Rating Affirmed Strong Buy USD q We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on Allmerica following its announcement of sharply lower than expected third quarter earnings to and our subsequent conversations with management While our recent upgrade of Allmerica could not have come at a worse time the thesis behind that upgrade is unchanged q In this environment most insurers are talking about how much their book value will fall but not Allmerica Its limited exposure to the World Trade Center disaster million pretax sustained although greatly reduced profitability and its limited general account common stock exposure mean that it will see book value maintained We are projecting third quarter book value to be per share Viacom Inc Stuart Linde Quantifying the Risk Strong Buy USD q Despite the fact that we are revising our estimates to reflect macroeconomic factors we believe that VIABs prominent brands proven management team and strong balance sheet position the company to weather the storm We believe VIAB will be one of the first stocks to react to a media resurgence q We are reducing our revenues to B from B on lowered ad revs as large accounts pause to reformulate campaigns although solid ratings from the fall lineup could help counter nearterm weakness Eastman Kodak Caroline Sabbagha Agfa Restructuring and Industry Comments Market Perform USD q Yesterday Agfa announced a major restructuring plan and discussed industry dynamics that confirm some of our concerns about longterm industry fundamentals Although one could argue that there are differences between Agfas and Kodaks market positioning as well as their profitability profiles we do fear that some of what Agfa discussed is relevant for Kodak We maintain our Market Perform rating on Kodak q The industry dynamics include a tough pricing environment in film the need for further industry consolidation and a digital transition that is occurring faster than expected Microsoft Corp Michael Stanek Expedia Deal May Have Erngs Impact to De Strong Buy USD q

overweight position on the independent refiner stocks q On the surface last nights inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute API appears extremely bearish given the outsize stock build in the gasoline market At a closer look the data tells a somewhat different story given that the huge inventory increase was driven largely by very high import levels specifically million barrels per day mmblsd over the past week which in our opinion is unsustainable In addition we expect next weeks implied gasoline demand to trend higher from this weeks dismal level of approximately mmblsd as consumers gradually return to the road Thus while the increase in gasoline inventories was substantially larger than expected we think it is premature to draw any negative conclusion In contrast to the gasoline market middle distillate stocks experienced an unexpected decline due to apparently strong demand which is an encouraging sign although we admit it is still too early to know for sure Looking ahead despite the current cloudy outlook we expect US refined product demand to hold up reasonably well as some of the lost jet fuel consumption should be replaced by increased gasoline and diesel demand as consumers opt for alternative means of transportation Bowater Inc Peter Ruschmeier Modest Q Shortfall not a Surprise Buy USD q Despite a modest Q EPS shortfall we find shares of BOW as increasingly attractive and recommend adding to positions on any pullback q BOW expects to report a Q loss of to per share which is below the consensus view but in line with our expectations q BOW now expects to take tonnes of newsprint downtime in both Q and Q which is greater than their previous guidance but not surprising given recent trends q The risk to our estimate of per share remains on the downside but we continue to believe Bowater has peak earnings power of more than per share FirstMerit Corp Brock Vandervliet Compelling Valuation But Our Caution Remains Market Perform q FMER notched up a better than expected second quarter performance and we have a high level of confidence in our full year estimates We remain concerned about the manufactured housing exposure FMER Market Perform q Although we dont expect a large margin boost we would not be surprised by a modest improvement on the order of bps which would be FMERs th consecutive qtr of margin gains Organic loan growth should run in the high single digit range which may be blunted by residential loan sales like last quarter q Fee and expense growth which were both solid in Q should be marked by similar performance with low double digit fee growth offset by midsingle digit expense growth largely linked to incentive fees q Our perennial concern particularly in this environment remains credit quality NPAs will likely climb higher putting them above bps with bps of NCOs Due to the manufactured housing operation which is roughly mm on balance sheet or just over of total loans we believe both NPAs and NCOs will continue to run above the midcap average Marshall Ilsley Jason Goldberg Q Preview MM Margin Metavante Buy USD q We continue to rate MI Buy with a price target q We expect MI to report operating EPS of at least on October Reported results will likely contain several acquisition related charges q Third quarter results will contain two months worth of MIs purchase acquisition of National City Bancorp q We expect the quarter to evidence continued net interest margin expansion and further improvement at Metavante We believe Q marked the bottom for revenues at MVNT q Sluggish loan growth could restrain further improvement q Asset quality metrics should hang in there although an uptick in NPAs is expected Wilmington Trust Brock Vandervliet Maintaining EstBut Consensus Looks High Market Perform USD q We remain confident in our WL estimates as they are already conservative and in the case of our estimate is nearly below Street consensus However the stock could come under pressure as others trim their guidance for q We carry a Q EPS estimate for Wilmington Trust WLin line with consensus WL is expected to release October th At this point we are maintaining our full year estimates

beating the consensus by a penny Its Q EPS was up YoY and QoQ Its Q earnings should also be strong We believe CCR should work as a safe stock and thus it should do well over the shortterm especially

has indeed put in a bottom over the last few days be prepared for us to retest the lows A successful test is what is needed followed by a meaningful rally The market has already factored in most of the bad news from corporate America We may also see individual stocks rise after releasing bad news This would also prove to be very meaningful Look to use this period to upgrade portfolios The year bond yield is The year is trading at The year is trading at Spot crude oil is trading at pb Natural Gas Henry Hub is trading at pmcf after having dipped below earlier Lehmans Research Banks Henry Chip Dickson Impact of Recession on Bank Trends CD q Many expect that the precarious US slowdown may already be in or tipping toward recession after the recent WTC incident Regardless of whether the US economy slips into recession it has been undergoing a transition from rapid growth of the s to a period of slow growth This transition has created a challenging operating environment for banks q This week we take a look at historical bank trends before during and after recessions Banks Jason Goldberg Weekly Bank Facts JG q The Lehman Brothers Bank Index ended the week down Our LargeCap Bank Index fell while the MidCap Bank Index declined q All major indices also were down this week The SP fell The Dow lost and Nasdaq was off by for the week City National Brock Vandervliet On Target With an Even Better Valuation Strong Buy USD q Although the stock is still roughly above where we upgraded it to Strong Buy back in March it has retraced most of its intervening gains Once again we believe it should be front and center in any discussion with investors in the smallercap financials at this time q We carry a Q EPS estimate of for CYN expected to report October Although confident in our estimate this is less than consensus q Given CYNs mildly asset sensitive positioning we wouldnt be surprised by some margin decline this quarter similar in magnitude to Q q Due to the declining runoff of the nonrelationship syndicated book we believe CYNs above average loan growth should be increasingly visible Commerce Bancorp Brock Vandervliet Q Preview and Mtg On Manhattan Rollout Buy USD q Although sharply below its highs along with so many other stocks CBH trades at a six multiple premium to the rest of the group and we are maintaining our investment rating of Buy q We carry a Q estimate of up from Q CBH should report October q We remain pretty confident in our numbers for several reasons First the NIM which was up bps in Q to should push higher still Second and perhaps more important from the perspective of CBH is far less dependent than most banks on incremental loan growth Commerce Bancshares Brock Vandervliet Q Preview Buy USD q Based on the likelihood of continued margin compression for the balance of the year we are trimming our estimates for the second half of Due to valuation we rate the shares Buy q We believe there is a chance CBSH could better our revised estimates due to the quasinonrecurring items including branch sale and student loan securitization gains CBSH typically sells a portfolio of student loans twice a year depending on supply and market conditions q We believe CBSH continues to repurchase shares at essentially the same pace of sharesquarter First Commonwealth Finl Brock Vandervliet FCF Q Preview Watching the Margin Market Perform USD q Save the possibility of a sharp margin decline which we view as unlikely from this level or dramatically higher credit costs we are confident in full year estimates of and which imply EPS growth FCF is rated Market Perform q We carry a Q EPS estimate in line with Q and consensus as well We expect FCF will report October As with Q this is inclusive of what may be a penny or two of investment securities gains q We have been concerned for sometime in the margin dynamic as Qs NIM of was an all time low after falling bps in the qtr We believe it could fall somewhat further although balance sheet trends appear to be reasonably positive First Tennessee Jason Goldberg Q Preview Further Upside Doable Buy USD q We continue to be positive on our outlook for FTN and rate the stock Buy Not only lower interest rates but fundamental improvements within this organization should aid results q Earlier in the quarter FTN announced it expects to post Q EPS of at least Our forecast pencils out to The company should report on October q We expect results to evidence continued strength in the net interest margin and growth in both mortgage banking and capital markets revenues Asset quality metrics should remain relatively stable Provident Financial Group Jason Goldberg Q Keeping an Eye on Asset Quality Buy USD q We rate PFGI Buy and expect the company to put down EPS growth rates ahead of its peers once current issues are put to bed However we believe the next few quarters could be bumpy and that PFGIs business model which is heavily exposed to commercial loans is more susceptible to downturns in the economy q We expect PFGI to report Q EPS of on October This compares to in the prior quarter q While continued loan growth and fee income expansion should lead to doubledigit revenue growth higher credit costs and the lack of net interest margin expansion should restrain further improvement Synovus Financial Jason Goldberg Q Preview Keeping an Eye on TSYS Buy USD q We rate SNV Buy SNV should benefit from its decentralized banking approach in the Southeast the buildout of its wealth management unit and the growing contribution of Total Systems q We expect SNV to report Q EPS of on October q Continued net interest margin expansion and solid loan growth should lead the banks results q We will keep a close eye on TSYS its card processing unit to see if new business related to its European rollout is enough to offset weaker than expected volume in midSeptember TSYS should report on October q We expect SNV to remain one of the few banks posting an ROE in the area and a ROA in the range Ace Limited J Paul Newsome Upgraded to Buy Estimates Lowered Strong Buy USD q We are upgrading ACE to Strong Buy from Buy with a per share price target Among the large cap insurers ACEs stock is one of the most inexpensive and it has among the most upside to better prices in the future in commercial insurance and reinsurance q The stock is trading at about book value under what we feel would be a worstcase scenario double ACE managements projected WTC loss Historically ACE has traded at of book value q Our price target assumes the company trades at roughly a discount from its historic pricetobook value one year from now Allmerica Financial J Paul Newsome Change of Recommendation Strong Buy USD q We are upgrading Allmerica to Strong Buy from Buy following the decline in its share price after the World Trade Center disaster Our new price target is per share down from per share q Allmerica as a relatively large regional insurer represents one of the better safe havens among the insurers largely unaffected by the World Trade Center disasterlittle World Trade Center loss exposure little investments in equities and strong balance sheets q At just of projected third quarter book value per share we think Allmerica represents compelling value HCC Insurance Hldgs J Paul Newsome Rating Affirmed Strong Buy USD q We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on HCC Insurance Holdings with a price target of per share down from per share q HCC Insurance Holdings falls nicely into the category of commercial insurers well poised to take advantage of the accelerating insurance prices following the tragic World Trade Center disaster Countrywide Credit Makiko Coakley CCR Will Report Its Q Earnings Tomorrow Buy USD q Countrywide will report its fiscal Q earnings for the quarter ending August on Tuesday The current consensus estimate for its Q is We are raising our estimate from to Due to the fact that CCR typically benefits from lower interest rates and that it has very limited credit risk exposure the stock seems to be working as a place to hide We believe this trend will likely continue as long as the equity market remains volatile and depressed q Mortgage rates declined and refinance activities picked up in Jul and Aug CCR recently reported its August production volume which was the highest monthly number in CCRs history Thus we are raising our Q EPS estimate by to Paychex Inc Adam Waldo InLine QtrSlight F Guidance Reduc Buy USD q Reflecting FQ results and new F guidance our DCF model shows the current share price assumes a far too pessimistic lowteens EPS growth rate over the next five years relative to our projection and managements target We would actively put new money to work in this blue chip Business Professional Services company q On September PAYX reported FQ ended August EPS of up year over year and inline with our estimates and the Street consensus Adept Technology Edward White Insight into Photonics Area Buy USD q While fundamentals in all of the companys served markets are particularly weak we believe the companys position in photonics assembly automation supports purchase of the shares for longterm riskoriented investors q Recently we attended a presentation by Adept Technology highlighting the companys capabilities in photonics assembly automation We believe the key takeaway is that the companys strategy of designing and developing platforms is progressing well q We believe a critical differentiating factor for Adept in the photonics market is the companys software simulation capability which has been critical to the cos initial successes with customers but is not currently appreciated by investors JDS Uniphase A Arnab Chanda Preannounces Remain Cautious Market Perform USD q We continue to be cautious on JDS Uniphase and would look for entry points once carrier capex stabilizes q As we expected JDS lowered its FQ rev forecast to M down qq vs our previous forecast of M down qq Although the company is seeing early signs of stabilization in demand we continue to believe that margin compression could be a bigger issue due to pricing q We are reducing CY revs from M down yy to M down yy and CY from M down yy to M down yy We believe gross margins will continue to decline and are modeling in FQ and in FQ We are also reducing FQ EPS from to CY EPS from to and CY EPS from to National Semiconductor Shareholder MtgFQ Guidance Reaffirmed Market Perform USD q NSM hosted a shareholder meeting on Fri reiterating FQ guidance of revs up qq Although the company made positive comments on recent order activity NSM was uncertain about the nearterm prospects for end demand This view is inline with our concerns q National indicated that its turns business has remained healthy through last week The company is seeing relative strength particularly in wireless of revs and displays of revs Similarly to our view however NSM is uncertain about the implications for real

<10145684.1075852672286.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.morris@lehman.com,2001-09-24 12:02:11,The Morning Market Call Monday September th Good Monday Morning Abbreviated Edition IMPACT CALLS Internet Security Israel Hernandez Company UpdatesRating Changes q Investment Conclusion Below are specific company updates and our views on each company in our coverage universe Reiterating our thoughts published on September we believe last weeks attacks are likely to cause numerous shortterm disruptions that put the September quarter at risk for all the security software vendors particularly those vulnerable to discretionary spending cuts or large deals In light of recent events we are adjusting our ratings on two companies We are raising our rating on VeriSign from a Buy to Strong Buy based on good earnings visibility amid a generally uncertain outlook for most software vendors We are also lowering our rating on Internet Security Systems from a Strong Buy to Buy to adjust for these uncertainties and lack of visibility While valuations for many of the companies are starting to look interesting as a whole we remain somewhat cautious on the security software vendors given the uncertainties introduced into the market over the last two weeks which could lead to more downward revisions in the September and December quarters and spill over in the first quarter of Internet Secuirty Systems Israel Hernandez Downgrading from Strong Buy to Buy Buy USD q We are downgrading ISSX from a Strong Buy to a Buy rating to reflect the lack of nearterm visibility and changing economic backdrop that increases the likelihood of a potential shortfall to our Q forecast q Given the events of the past two weeks we believe ISS and other security software vendors may run into difficulty closing business in a backend loaded September quarter q We are lowering our price target from to or x FY revenues of M to reflect the increased economic uncertainty in the current environment VeriSign Inc Israel Hernandez Upgrading to Strong Buy from Buy Strong Buy USD q Given VeriSigns strong revenue visibility in a period of global economic uncertainty we are raising our rating from Buy to Strong Buy making it our top pick in the sector q In light of the global slowdown we believe VeriSign provides investors with exceptional earnings visibility given its services model and strong deferred revenue balance This visibility should enable VeriSign to sustain a premium valuation and outperform most technology stocks even in a contracting environment q We believe new value added services laid on top of a relatively fixed cost structure will provide significant margin expansion currently at and growing to the low thirties in the next years Oil Gas Exploration Production Thomas R Driscoll Some EP Shares Now Appear Attractive q We are lowering our natural gas price forecasts as well as revising target prices and codes for the largecap oil exploration and production companies we cover We now believe that several companies we cover offer compelling values today As a result we are upgrading our ratings on the shares of EOG Resources EOG Noble Affiliates NBL and Pioneer Natural Resources PXD from Buy to Strong Buy We are also downgrading our code on the shares of Devon Energy DVN from Buy to Outperfrom to reflect heightened concerns about the increased debt load that will result from recently announced acquisitions We are also downgrading our codes on Vintage Petroleum VPI from Strong Buy to Buy AOL Time Warner Holly Becker Fund Remain Strong In Unstable Environm Buy USD q The economic and advertising slowdown has obviously been compounded by recent tragic events AOL Time Warner remains the premier integrated media company with a uniquely valuable portfolio of assets While nearterm estimates may need to come down further we view the stocks pullback as a compelling buying opportunity q AOL Time Warners core businesses offer investors superior earnings power and growth while new crossplatform initiatives should propel the companys longterm growth rate to above industry norms q Advertising represents only of revenue considerably lower than comparable companies including Viacom and Disney Gaming Lodging Joyce Minor Rich Bottom Fishing But Dangerous Water q The gaming and lodging sectors saw huge downside moves last week with the large cap gaming stocks down an average of and the lodging stocks down an average of The hotel REITs were down too by on average We continue to believe that calling the course of the conflict determines your appetite for the sector Investors that believe in a short period of pain followed by a gradual rebound would buy the stocks now especially gaming companies like HET STN PENN but even the other large cap gaming and lodging names would appear near historical bottoms and attractive for the long haul Among the hotel REITs the unwinding of the FCHMHX merger seems to have overly punished both but especially MHX We think MHX is an absolute Strong Buy at these levels More broadly investors like us that are concerned by the potential course and duration of the conflict and the risk of events that will merit continuing travel fears may opt to stay on the sidelines with respect to the gaming and lodging stocks q Lodging stocks are trading at discounts to replacement of to vs typical bottom and gaming at discounts of or so Lodging REIT yields are to even if dividends are reduced by Wireless Internet Infrastructure Timothy Luke Investigating Chinese Telecom Markets q Following checks with numerous industry sources in China we have attempted to clarify some concerns over China Telecoms capex a possible slowdown in metro markets in China q Believe CT may have reduced its planned capex in recent months by about from b to b and slowed down discretionary spending Reductions appear to be a result from the uncertainty pending CTs major reorganization q In the nterm we believe that vendors like Cisco and Nortel may see their sales into CT somewhat below normalized levels However this situation should be temporary and we may see an uptick in spending by CT once reorg is completed Nevertheless we believe capex is likely to be below q Separately the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry recently issued a Notice to regulate broadband access networks We believe some metro vendors may be impacted by this ruling since Layer switches are also sometimes deployed to provide lastmile access FOCUS STOCK Bed Bath Beyond Alan Rifkin Second Quarter Earnings Preview Buy USD q BBBY will report Q EPS after the market close on September While no retailer is immune to an economic slowdown we remain confident BBBY will achieve our Q EPS est of vs last year q We estimate total sales rose to MM driven by a comp q We forecast a bp decrease in gross margin which combined with an bp improvement in SGA results in a modest increase in Q operating margin q BBBY remains one of our top picksthe only retailer within our universe of coverage to meet or exceed its original guidance since mid Wellinsulated with MM in cash and debt q Valuation Currently trading at a premium to SP though historically has traded bw a discount and premium Liberty Media Group Stuart Linde Sensitivity Analysis Limited Downside Strong Buy USD q Our worst case scenario yields a NAV of per share We believe that current trading levels represent a compelling buying opportunity as downside risk is limited by lowest exposure to advertising market in our universe risk management strategy and strong balance sheet q At the close of days following the tragic terrorist attacks LMCA has declined by in line with the SP Entertainment Index versus a decline for the market COMPANY INDUSTRY UPDATE Health Care Distribution Technology Lawrence Marsh Lehman Weekly Persp THE WORST DAY q Lehman Brothers Health Care Distribution Technology Weekly Comments and Perspectives q We are providing a review of last week in our Health Care Distribution Technology universe THE WORST DAY commenting on the horror seen in the city on September q Our covered group was down since September th vs the SP down the Russell down and the NASDAQ Composite down over the same period Henry Schein up was the strongest performer for that period OMI down was the weakest performer q We are providing a brief review of implications from the past two weeks in our group and also pointing to points from our Fall Outlook Update We also point to our reiteration of our initiations on ACDO and GTIV and our upgrade on PSSI q We are providing a K review of DKWD highlighting a SCOR update and noting recent news items from CAH GTIV SCOR PSSI OMI Portfolio Strategy Charles Reinhard Cutting Exp EPS Eqty Returns Valuat q The policy response to the savage attack on civilization continues to be vigorous A sustained diplomatic and military campaign against terrorism is coming into place Monetary policy has been aggressive with more to come And fiscal policy is swinging into gear Still the United States is likely to remain in recession for the remainder of We are thus cutting our SP EPS forecast from to this year and from to next year In a riskier world we are also assuming lower valuation for the stock market Accordingly we are cutting our forward oneyear SP price target from to the Dow Jones Industrials equivalent is q Our Economics team is now looking for a shallow US recession for the second half of this year with GDP down roughly in the third and fourth quarters The jobless rate will rise to we think as CPI drops to With the Fed Funds rate at expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates to at the next FOMC on October With core CPI at that would take the real Fed Funds rate below zero Historically the real Fed Funds rate has always gone to at least zero during profit recessions of the current magnitude Whether the Fed will need to do more after October remains to be seen That the central bank will do whatever it needs to do is beyond question With another drop in shortterm interest rates the yield curve should steepen further NOTES FROM TODAY Specialty Chemicals Timothy Gerdeman Cautiously Accumulate Select Chem Stks q While it remains premature to fully assess the ultimate impact to US specialty chemical companies resulting from last weeks terrorist attacks certain stock valuations may already discount the likely adverse business impact The table provided below lists respective share price declines occurring since the stock market reopened on September For conservatism we now assume zero global GDP growth and flat versus prior expectation of lower raw material costs which could place an approximately downward bias to our average EPS expectations Handicapping our preferred shareprice entry points for risks currently present right now we would accumulate CYT particularly below share CBM particularly below share EC particularly below share and APD below share Carnival Corp Felicia Rae Kantor Searching for a Bottom Market Perform USD q We are maintaining our Market Perform rating on CCL While the company had impressive momentum going into Q and the macroenvironment has changed As such the riskreward still points to the downside in our opinion q That said this note provides investors with several tools that should provide assistance with finding an attractive entry point for CCL q We have also taken a first stab at our earnings estimates by lowering QE and E EPS to and from and respectively q Both our scenario revenue analysis and our total return analysis illustrates that the stock could bottom at However a protracted and deep recession could render this analysis invalid Darden Restaurants Mitchell Speiser Conf Call HiLights Sept Solid Strong Buy USD q Comps steadily improved following last Tues are now running Positive Fears of vulnerability seem overestimated even in a weaker economy q Mgmt maintains FY Comps target at lowerend of range EPS growth forecast takes into account the illeffects of rising unemployment q Sales trends resumed to normal levels over the weekend are running positive much better than expectations Through last Sunday Olive Garden Comps Red Lobster q An aging consumer lower seafood costs less dilution from new concepts Repo will occur despite weaker economy so our FYE EPS remains Department StoresBroadlines Jeffrey Feiner Retail Company Share Repurchase Programs q Below we have listed the buyback authorizations as well as the share repurchase activities for the major retailers q We believe certain of the major retailers including WalMart and May Department Stores have been aggressively buying shares this past week with the drop in the equities markets As many of the major retailers in our universe have significant cash balances and ample availability left under current share authorizations we would expect many retailers to continue to repurchase company shares at these depressed levels which could cushion some downside from poor September sales results Note that shares left under authorization may differ from levels reported below due to the market activities of companies since the end of their respective Q reporting periods Department StoresBroadlines Jeffrey Feiner Retail Industry Update Conference Call q We cordially invite you to participate in our conference call to update investors on Department StoreBroadline Retailers on Monday September at pm EST q With the continued uncertainty around consumer confidence and retail spending we believe that several retailers offer a reasonable amount of downside protection given their defensive positioning relative to product mix We will be providing investors with an update on several select stocks including WalMart Costco Kmart BJs and Family Dollar as well as providing investors with an update on the overall department storeBroadline and Specialty Stores apparel retail industry Oil Tankers Daniel L Barcelo Weaker Demand Outweighs any War Bounce q Tragedy buttressing rates nearterm Negative implications next year q Due to the terrorist attacks economic activity and air travel are expected to be lower resulting in lower demand for oil products this year and next However it is not likely that supply will be immediately interrupted as major oil producing nations are not yet direct targets for retaliation As charterhire rates track oil production we expect sustained upward movement in rates nearterm If a supply interruption does occur it will be negative for charterhire rates Lower economic growth next year could imply less supply from OPEC Valuations remain extremely depressed with shares trading at a discount to NAV and x EVDACF with a group average ROCE of over however the low liquidity of the group is a negative in this market Duke Energy Daniel Ford Duke Energy Acquires Westcoast Energy Buy USD q In our opinion the acquisition of Westcoast Energy is longterm positive for Duke We estimate that the transaction will be accretive to earnings and provide additional growth opportunities in North America Nearterm arbitrage pressure and regulatory review will likely hold back DUK shares q After last Thursday nights close Duke Energy announced the acquisition of Westcoast Energy in a stock and cash deal valued at billion q Under the terms of the agreement Westcoast shareholders will receive C per share in cash shares of Duke Energy or a combination of both such that the overall consideration will be cash and stock PGE Corp Daniel Ford PCG Reorganization Plan Emerges Buy USD q PCGs utility filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan in SF yesterday indicating substantial EPS upside potential in We reiterate our Buy rating Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to PGE Corp which is a coproponent of the reorg plan q PCGs utility subsidiary filed its plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court yesterday Preliminary analysis of the unique plan which would not require CPUC approval indicates potential upside to of consolidated earnings in and in q Legal challenges to specific portions of the reorganization plan could limit the earnings upside potential and delay the timing of emergence from bankruptcy Associated BancCorp Jason Goldberg Q Preview Market Perform USD q We believe ASBCs current valuation reflects recent improvements the expected margin expansion from its liability sensitive balance sheet and pristine credit quality We rate ASBC Market Perform q We expect ASBC to report Q EPS of at least on October Continued strength in the net interest margin could provide upside to our estimate q Q should witness continued expansion in net interest margin and moderating commercial loan growth Mortgage banking and service fees should continue to lead increases in fee income q Asset quality metrics should continue to be better than its peers q Our and EPS estimates old GAAP are and respectively On a new GAAP

expansion led by mortgage banking and controlled expenses q Asset quality ratios are expected to continue to show signs of deterioration q While Q will mark the eighth time in the last nine quarters and the thirteenth time in the last nineteen quarters the company has restated results it is expected to be the last First Midwest Bancorp Jason Goldberg Q Preview Margin Expansion Continues Market Perform USD q In our view FMBIs strong franchise being nicely positioned in Chicago Land consistent earnings growth and sound asset quality are the reasons the company trades at a premium to our MidCap Bank index We rate FMBI Market Perform q FMBI raised Q guidance today to above its previous expectations of to Better than expected results should be driven by to bp expansion in the net interest margin Mgmt also expressed comfort with Q consensus of We remain a penny ahead at q In addition to margin expansion results should evidence moderate loan growth and continued fee income expansion Johnson Johnson David A Gruber Coated stent leadership still evident Buy USD q The Cook ASPECT data do not alter our hypothesis that JJ is well positioned to obtain a sustainable stent

have tried to use this letter for purely business purposes and not to push any personal agenda However now is the time to make some personal comments Everyday we find it difficult to comprehend what we saw on that fateful Tuesday morning The enormity of the what was done with out regard to life Nothing Who could plan such a thing Who would It is hard very hard to conceptualize what they did What type of mind would think to do such a thing And then have others who would agree that it was a good idea What type of people And the cheering We think of our fellow Americans and others who perished And the hero who gave their lives on the plane and on the ground We think of the heroes who did not give their lives We think of the friends that we never met The friends that we now will never meet How could humanity do what was done We think of our business associate Ira Zaslow who is missing Our thoughts are with his family We think of all those who lost their lives We think of their families Lives snuffed out by people consumed with hate And not only lives lost last week We think of the missing generations to come Those generations that will never be Oh the waste for what Rally around America Rally around Democracy Rally around what is right There is no equivocation about Right and Wrong Life is sacred Those who disregard life are the ones who will be condemned for eternal damnation There it has been said The following comment was written yesterday but was never sent The bottom line is go out buy stocks and go out and buy in the shops and malls And light a candle to never forget The market is very oversold We are seeing many technical readings similar to those we saw at the bottom of the markets in and These are very strong signs of market capitulation For example the VIX volatility Index is at a peak that is normally seen at market bottoms Short Interest is at record levels a good sign Money Market assets the amount of cash on hand is almost equal to of the entire capitalization of the stock market a very high degree of liquidity The number of market advisors who are negative on the market is now greater than the number who are positive on the market a traditionally bullish signal The PUTCALL ratio has been very very high all week at turnaround numbers The Fed has reduced rates now times and liquidity in the system is high Inflation is low Just when the market is NOT expected to rally it will That is the nature of a bottom Lets hope that all these technical readings turn the market sooner rather than later Now is the time IMPACT CALLS Natural Gas Peggy Connerty A Safe Harbor in a Storm We continue to believe the Master Limited Partnership sector will remain a safe harbor for investors as the economy teters on the brink of a recession Given the possible recessionary environment Mondays basis point cut in the federal funds rate now and the relatively few alternative investments available we continue to be bullish on the MLP sector MLPs in general are defensive in nature provide income and have decent growth prospects The cash distributions on most MLPs are protected with solid coverage ratios with distributable cash averaging of cash distribution Therefore we believe the MLP sector should hold up during this time of economic and political crisis Please refer to our note titled Weak Economy Low Interest Rates Bode Well for MLPs published September PC Software Microsoft Michael Stanek Trimming Estimates to Match Reality Trimming estimates to match reality We are cutting our estimates for FY from of B to B in revs and EPS from to Microsoft has never been as well positioned as it is today Overall we have made the majority of our cuts in the December and balance of the Qs in The stock is down in the wake of sliding economic conditions and exacerbated this recent tragedy Imaging Technology Eastman Kodak Caroline Sabbagha Tweaking Revised Estimates With a little more information and insight we are tweaking our estimates for and For FY our estimate is now For FY we are lowering our EPS estimate to We maintain our Market Perform rating We think the issues at Kodak are more than just the economy They include a technology transition and competitive pressures in its traditional businesses We are also beginning to get concerned about cashflow and therefore expect the balance sheet to be weaker than had been anticipated We think the stock should settle in the mids with the dividend yield acting as a support for the stock New MediaECommerce Amazon Holly Becker Amazon Update We expect AMZN like most retailers will suffer from the current political unrest This leads us to believe that even the low end of guidance of mm in revenues may be difficult to achieve Our Q ests for breakeven operating profits and mm in cash hinge on our Q sales est of B While it is too soon to tell we will likely need to revisit these ests in the upcoming weeks About weeks ago AMZN lowered its book prices by approx While this was likely successful in increasing demand the recent catastrophe in the US will obviously offset the benefits On Sept AMZN announced a yr alliance with Target Corp in which AMZN will open a Target store at Amazoncom later this fall and power all of Targets online sites beginning in summer While financially this agreement will be small we see several strategic opportunities which include expanding into new categories enhancing direct vendor relationships and the possibility of utilizing Targets physical locations New MediaECommerce eBay Holly Becker Well Positioned to Sustain Growth eBays business appears to be relatively unscathed by the current political and economic events q On Sept eBay articulated they are comfortable with Q consensus of mm in rev and EPS our ests are mm in rev and EPS eBays listings dropped on Sept however the company expects listings and sales to recover to preSept levels in the next few days We estimate eBay suffered from days of lost sales Separately the company announced ambitious plans to raise mm in days in response to the recent disaster at the World Trade Center Dubbed Auction for America the campaign enables sellers to list items on eBay with resulting proceeds to be donated to various relief efforts The stock is down over since Sept and is likely to bounce in the near term however we remain cautious given its still rich valuation Semiconductor Capital Equipment Applied Materials Edward White Announces Layoffs of Global Workfor Industry weakness and the events of last week have forced AMAT to change its strategy and join its peers in announcing layoffs We maintain our Strong Buy rating but are cautious on the shares near term given reduced visibility and the fact that shares are trading at a premium to historical trough levels In an important change in direction Applied this morning announced layoffs of employees roughly of its global workforce Layoffs will result in a Q restructuring charge of an unspecified amount Since the last conference call the economic and semiconductor industry climate has continued to worsen This along with the traqic events of last week have left AMAT with zero visibility No immediate disruption in business has occurred the company does expect some indirect impact AMAT remains committed to RD and Field Support Engineers and this should help the company ramp up quickly in the next upturn COMPANY INDUSTRY UPDATE Wireline Services Verizon Communications Blake Bath Achieves PA Approval on Schedule VZ Achieves PA Approval on Schedule Opens a B Market and brings its total approvals to states NY CT MA PA VZ is the clear leader in approvals and has effectively delivered versus its public guidance in this regard entry is expected to add bps to total revenue growth and bps

it on schedule for approvals in these states between FebMar In total the PA approval and the upcoming state approvals are expected to open a B market to VZ in total by midyear we expect VZ to be marketing to a new B LD market within the BEL region VZ is the leader in approvals NOTES FROM TODAY Cosmetics Household Personal Care Rayovac Ann Gillin Lefever Discretionary Spending Grinds to a Halt Rayovacs halved earnings expectations for the current quarter suggest both that consumer discretionary spending has ground to a halt and that the retailer is battening down the hatches by postponing and potentially cancelling orders to further cut working capital levels As we noted yesterday consumer staples companies tend to outperform during periods of economic stress However todays news confirms that those with discretionery spending exposure are less likely to participate with strong relative earnings growth We remain concerned about Gillettes Energizers and Rayovacs exposure to batteries where we estimate that discretionery spending is circa of trend growth as well as Gillettes exposure to a razor trade up strategy Our earnings estimates for ROV change from to for FY Sept and from to for FY Our FY estimates are below managements guidance due mostly to a more cautious view on battery category growth Our target has been reduced to and we maintain our Buy rating Gaming Lodging Hilton Group Joyce Minor Company Outlines PostAttack Outlook Yesterday Hilton hosted a conference call to update the investment community on the state of the company and its operating outlook subsequent to the terrorist attacks of September th Although no specific guidance was given the company is hoping that poor travel trends last just weeks followed by a return to normalized travel trends albeit at a level steppeddown to not the better trends If EPS is a guide note that EPS of is below our preattack EPS estimate Investors that concur with Hiltons hypothesis that travel fears will be shortlived should probably buy the stocks at these levels For those like us that are concerned that additional events could prolong or renew travel fears it may be too early to check in to the lodging sector Restaurants Darden Restaurants Mitchell Speiser Beats ConsensusConf Call at pm An aging consumer lower seafood costs less dilution from new concepts Repo will occur despite a weaker

Gas Storage This weeks natural gas storage injection of Bcf was slightly stronger than our Bcf expectation Oil Services Drilling Tidewater James Crandell Lowering Fiscal and EPS Estima The moderating activity in the Gulf of Mexico is negatively impacting Tidewaters earnings more than we previously expected We continue to believe that improving international activity and the startup of new vessel contracts will partially offset this domestic moderation Given that the stock is currently below its currentcycle high and trading at attractive levels on anticipated earnings and cash flow we believe that the stock is attractively valued at current levels We are again lowering our fiscal and earnings estimates to from and to from to reflect lowerthanexpected domestic vessel utilisation which will lead to downward pressure on day rates This follows a earnings reduction last week We believe that domestic utilisation will remain weak over the next four quarters Domestic day rates have remained steady todate but will likely start to erode in the fourth quarter Power NRG Daniel Ford NRG Reaffirms Earnings Expectations We continue to believe that NRG is the most defensive investment in the IPPMerchant Sector We maintain our Strong Buy with a price target In light of last weeks tragedy and continued market skittishness regarding power supply fundamentals in front of negative GDP predictions NRG management issued a release to reconfirm its EPS guidance for followed by annual growth in and beyond Further management indicated that it terminated its efforts to close on the Wisvest acquisition MW due to insurmountable regulatory hurdles We continue to be confident in our and EPS estimates for NRG of and given managements conservative and disciplined business approach This has enabled the company to time and time again stand by earnings expectations despite the ever changing market fundamentals Power Daniel Ford Electric Utilities and Power Weekly We are previewing the events of the upcoming week of September We look for the New Jersey BPU to approve the FirstEnergyGPU merger on September We also provide a list of some potential postmerger closing international asset divestitures Parties in New Jersey could submit testimony regarding the Potomac Electric POM Market Perform Conectiv CIV Market Perform merger proceeding early next week Power DTE Energy Gregg Orrill Another Good Yield Hog Story As an integrated utility with a yield DTE should do well in a recessionary backdrop Below we review the DTE outlook and reiterate our price target which is x our E DTE is well positioned to do well in the current environment with a traditional utility focus a stock buyback authorization and a short power position DTE had M left on the current stock buyback plan and a lingering M share authorization Industrial sales are down YTD However the lower margin earned on these customers and DTEs short position make this a positive impact on the company Offsetting factors include lower pension income and outlook for Plug Power We reiterate our EPS estimates of for respectively The MCN acquisition and fuel cost timing weight more income to Q vs Q We look for in Q and for Q Power Technology Thomas ONeill CT DPUC Draft Draws a Blank CT DPUC releases draft decision that denies FCEL MW project entirely Reducing shares of FCEL to Market Perform from Strong Buy due to lack of material catalysts and potential downside to share Late Wednesday the CT DPUC issued a draft decision that denied funding to an ENECRRA proposal that would have resulted in a MW order for FuelCell Energy While the draft decision could be adjusted to provide funding in a final decision early Oct the wording of the order appears to point the companies towards additional state funding vehicles which would likely take multiple months to tap and would be speculative at this point We believe the disappointing CT DPUC draft decision leaves shares vulnerable to the downside share and likely caught in a lower trading range until sub MW and MW launch size order flow can be generated That said FCELs share of fully diluted cash and leadership in carbonate technology should limit downside even in the current market environment Banks First Virginia Banks Kristin Nemec Q Preview Although credit experience has been excellent we remain cautious in our outlook due to the consumer exposure and lower than average net income growth FVB is rated Market Perform We carry an operating estimate of in line with consensus No change in our estimates of and for and respectively The balance sheet dynamic is driven by managements decision to pull back in the indirect auto business by simply pricing less aggressively Due to a pullback of many competitors and the rate environment we believe spreads have widened in the indirect business We expect the near term expense progression to be minimal Banks Bank One Henry Chip Dickson Third Quarter Preview We continue to rate ONE Market Perform The deteriorating economic environment should cause further downward earnings revisions for ONE as well as pushing out the inflection point when the company really begins to establish EPS momentum We are also reducing our target price to Given the deteriorating economic environment we are reducing our estimates for ONE assuming higher credit costs and modestly lower levels of revenue For Q we expect ONE to report during the week of October This represents a reduction of from our previous estimate For we are lowering our estimate to For we are lowering our estimate to New GAAP EPS should be higher in We do believe our estimate is on the conservative side Biotechnology Joseph Dougherty Discovery Collaboration with Takeda The agreement calls for the development of small molecule leads against a target proprietary to Takeda We view this deal as a significant positive for Array featuring both excellent deal structure and potential for future expansion This is Arrays th significant collaboration in the past months that is tied to potential downstream revenue participation We point out to investors that company management had guided us to expect a total of royaltybased deals by the end of September and this announcement points to possible upside to our numbers We note that Arrays shares have sold off more severely than the biotech group overall although not to the extent of some of their competitors We believe the shares are very attractive at these levels Biotechnology ImClone Systems Michael Wood IMCL Signs Strategic Agreement wBMY Deal with Bristol Myers will provide billion in cash and access to world class oncology franchise ImClone announced that it has signed a major strategic partnership with Bristol Myers to commercialize its lead drug IMCC ImClone will receive billion in upfront and milestone payments Bristol Myers will take responsibility for sales and marketing and will pay ImClone a royalty on net sales We are changing our

to Bristol Myers in connection with this transaction Major Pharmaceuticals Lilly Eli Charles Butler SOLD Oritavancin OutLicensed to ITMN Yesterday LLY announced that InterMune had acquired worldwide rights to oritavancin latestage Phase III compound under development for complicated skin infections and bacteremia We had anticipated a potential launch for this compound thus we are not changing any near term revenue or earnings estimates The agreement provides InterMune with exclusive worldwide rights to develop manufacture and commercialize oritavancin We understand from LLY that NPV analysis supported the licensing of oritavancin to another party versus the continued development of this molecule internally Additionally LLYs stable of late stage compounds is extensive Arguably licensing oritavancin to InterMune will allow LLY to maximize the full potential of this innovative compound while the company redirects its internal resources to other latestage pipeline opportunities Health

est of and the street consensus of Tenet continues to benefit from accelerating revenue growth trends improved cashflow generation and debt reduction initiatives We note that this news was widely

Ford revenues estimated at which is not particularly surprising given the sudden and dramatic nature of the production cuts For the time being we are lowering our EPS estimate from to and our EPS estimate from to The potential for additional Ford production cuts in Q may lead us to trim estimates further VCs high degree of earnings sensitivity to production volumes resulting from the suppliers substantial operating leverage and depressed margins makes it one of the most vulnerable automotive suppliers to a protracted economic slowdown Business Professional Services Cintas dam Waldo Soft FQ

Machinery Caterpillar Joel Tiss Still Waiting CAT shares have declined over during the past few weeks from yet we are still waiting patiently to buy trying to minimize downside risk It is difficult to ascertain if recent events will change the long term construction trends as economic weakness may accelerate potentially setting up recovery in late Government construction spending should remain strong Downside risk in shares remains We would be much more interested in buying below and would become more aggressive in the low to mid s However nibbling in the low to mid s may not be the worst idea Believe upside stock potential remains mid decade based on peak EPS however timing of peak earnings is more of a question than levels Advertising Marketing Services Kevin Sullivan Global ad stocks continue to come under pressure following last weeks attacks on Old Glory The selloff creates a compelling investment opportunity among the stronger names such as Omnicom Last weeks events came at a difficult time for media stocks the ad market was still weak and consumer and business confidence was rocked both key elements in the resurgence of industry growth Consensus estimates have become that much more challenging For the ad holding companies we believe the nearterm impact is minimal since the vast majority of the groups revenues are feebased However the potential for additional pullbacks in ad spending further supports our belief of downside risk in Q estimates Valuations have largely already adjusted for this risk in our view Our favorite name continues to be OMC which is trading at less than x our EBITDA estimate The stock appears to be discounting the worst and we would recommend investors use the weakness as an opportunity to accumulate positions Entertainment Disney Stuart Linde Keeping It All in PerspectiveBalancing We believe that at current levels Disney encapsulates most of the downside risk of the US recession and the terrorism threat As opposed to its peers Disney has the added risk of a decline in domestic and international travel to its theme parks About of the companys EBITDA is generated by theme parks and broadcasting The theme parks are about of DIS annual EBITDA In theme park EBITDA dropped We believe the studio and consumer divisions could offset some of the loss The studio will be bolstered by releases such as Monsters Inc in Nov and continuing DVD sales propelled by the Platinum Collection In this difficult period people need entertainment and fantasy especially of the wholesome uplifting signature Disney genre While the stock has begun to discount lower expectations Investors are looking to identify downside support for ent cos such as DIS In our sensitivity analysis we have used a trough multiple of x and varied

diversity of its franchise Integrated Oil European Recommendation Downgrades Jeremy Elden Low risk but low recovery potential Following last weeks tragic events we are leaving most of our price targets unchanged The larger companies now look cheap in absolute terms However we expect equity markets to rally even more strongly leaving the oil sector behind and perhaps making the current position a longterm relative high point for the sector as seen in and For now the sector has the advantage of being lower risk but once investors feel more comfortable with the economic and political outlook they may move elsewhere Oil supply currently unaffected Demand expected to fall Eni and TotalFinaElf have greater exposure to Mid EastNAfrica Repsol YPF price target cut to E from E ENI rating cut from Strong Buy to Buy TotalFinaElf rating cut from Buy to Market Perform Oil Gas Exploration Production Thomas R Driscoll OutlookShares in Light of Development Recent events do not substantially change our view of intermediateterm oil and gas fundamentals We remain cautious on the EP sector overall but we are looking for selective purchase opportunities Nearterm prospects are that oil prices may be higher than we previously thought Weakening economic activity may hurt natural gas demand and lead to a more prolonged natural gas oversupply situation and weaker natural gas prices EP shares fell on Monday and we are looking for entry points Both EOG Resources and Noble Affiliates appear to be more than below our estimate of fair value COMPANY INDUSTRY UPDATE Beverages Michael Branca Consistency Predictability Uncertaiin From an earnings stability perspective the beverage industry will plainly be hurt by recent events and increasing recessionary pressure in the nearterm But historically the industry has still generated relatively consistent profit and cash flow growth even during recession and slowgrowth economic environments Nearly all consumer products including commercial beverages are impacted during such trying times However the beverage industry tends to suffer less significant shortterm consumption disruptions and a far more rapid return to normalcy Moreover the big beverage companies tend to suffer less as their product portfolios are skewed to more affordable traditional products which could benefit from trade down consumer behavior Fortunately these companies are blessed with the virtue of consistently generating tremendous amounts of free cash flow such operating performance affords far greater opportunities for share repurchase and equity stock price supportresilience especially in volatile markets Cosmetics Household Personal Care Ann Gillin Lefever Seeking Earnings Stability From an earnings stability perspective the household and personal care industry will plainly be hurt by recent events and the increasing recessionary pressure in the near term However the industry is likely to outperform the market from an earnings growth perspective which has historically led to multiple expansion above current levels q Among the large caps companies in our coverage we currently prefer Colgate for its earnings consistency driven by the strongest unit growth in the group PG is our next choice due both to its recent efforts to reign in costs and consequently improve its earnings consistency and its valuation relative to the other large caps Likewise Clorox is currently in the costcutting mode Gillette is our least favorite as we believe that it is most exposed to discretionary consumer spending and has already fully priced in the expected upside from its very focused management team q Notwithstanding that the large caps are most likely to benefit from an investor flight to liquidity we are not inclined to chase the small caps As we have noted in the last month we believe that Dial almost fully discounts a takeout price which we peg at roughly Energizer and Rayovac appear exposed to consumer discretionary spending particularly as we enter the allimportant CY Q Underlying fundamentals at Playtex are still not strong enough to drive relative earnings out performance a key driver of multiple expansion Food Andrew Lazar Stocks Offer Earnings Stability q From an earnings stability perspective the packaged food industry will plainly be hurt by recent events and increasing recessionary pressure in the near term But historically the industry has generated relatively stable profit growth even during recession q In short the packaged food sector is generally less economically sensitive than other sectors and unlike many other sectors has not had pricing leverage for years q While food stocks are not inexpensive trading at the upper end of their historic trading range the group has traded at as much as a relative premium during periods of slower economic growth suggesting potential further relative outperformance NOTES FROM TODAY Oil Gas Exploration Production Thomas R Driscoll Storage Report Wedn at

with a strong presence within the Gulf of Mexico as well as in the international markets Continued weakness within the GOM has resulted in a further reduction in our estimates however international

to Offset Airline Traffic Drop The markets immediate response has hit Cendants stock by xx due mainly to its increasing exposure to the travel sector While we may have to lower our estimates a few

<30196534.1075852674492.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.morris@lehman.com,2001-09-17 13:22:07,The Morning Market Call Monday September th Good Monday Afternoon Comments From The Local Guys Were back We are also lost for words to describe our thoughts about last weeks attack We may have more to say over time At this stage we would like to refer our readers to the Lehman Brothers website for a message from Richard Fuld the Chairman Chief Executive Officer of Lehman Brothers Lehmans Research IMPACT CALLS Portfolio Strategy Jeffrey Applegate After September The dreadful events of this week will probably push the US economy and profits further down to a V bottom the profits recession will now also be deeper than our forecast of with a trough in third quarter The dreadful events of this week will probably push the US economy and profits further down to a V bottom the profits recession will now also be deeper than our forecast of with a trough in third quarter But the vicious nature of the attack has prompted a vigorous monetary and fiscal policy response at a time when the SP is more than below fair value we expect that the stock market will rally on primarily cyclical leadership Banks Update The expectation of aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and SEC actions to ease share repurchase restrictions should help many large cap bank stocks We highlight BAC C FITB FBF JPM and WFC Following Tuesdays tragedy the US government took steps to increase liquidity to the financial system and provide additional sources of support for stocks The Federal Reserve provided liquidity and is expected to reduce rates aggressively while the SEC took actions to Facilitate Reopening of Fair and Orderly Equities Markets The ramifications of these actions should include wider net interest margins increased mortgage refinance activity and an acceleration of share repurchase activity Some of the companies that would seem to benefit immediately from these actions include BAC C FBF FITB JPM and WFC q Our strategist Jeff Applegate recommends almost a double weighting of financial stocks vs a market weighting of Mid Cap Banks We expect the Fed to aggressively lower interest rates during the remainder of year We view NFB and SOTR both of which are down over the last two trading weeks as liability sensitive plays FTN MTB and BBT should benefit from large mortgage banking operations The recent weakness in bank stocks and the easing of restrictions should cause companies to increase share repurchase activity Companies in this camp include CBSS FMBI HBAN NFB and TCB Our rated stocks are CYN CBSS CFR NFB TCB and ZION We view MTB and SOTR as trading buys at current levels Midcap banks tend to do well in a low inflation low interest rate environment which our forecast calls for The wildcard however continues to be the economy Electric Utilities CT DPUC Draft Draws a Blank CT DPUC releases draft decision that denies FCEL MW project entirely Reducing shares of FCEL to Market Perform from Strong Buy due to lack of material catalysts and potential downside to share Late Wednesday the CT DPUC issued a draft decision that denied funding to an ENECRRA proposal that would have resulted in a MW order for FuelCell Energy While the draft decision could be adjusted to provide funding in a final decision early October the wording of the order appears to point the companies towards additional state funding vehicles which would likely take multiple months to tap and would be speculative at this point We believe the disappointing CT DPUC draft decision leaves shares vulnerable to the downside share and likely caught in a lower trading range until sub MW and MW launch size order flow can be generated That said FCELs share of fully diluted cash and leadership in carbonate technology should limit downside even in the current market environment Electric Utilities Gray Growing Weaker in Round The CA Senate failed to reach agreement on a revised SBXX and therefore failed to call a vote at the end of the legislative session We maintain our Market Perform rating on shares of EIX The CA Senate failed to reach a compromise on a bill to avert bankruptcy for EIXs utility SCE in the wee hours of the session Although the major terms of a revised deal were intact the Senate lacked the votes to bring a successful vote Gov Davis has called for a third extraordinary session in early October to try to force a compromise bill through both the Assembly and Senate As anticipated consumer opposition remained the sticking point but surprisingly Gov Davis lacked the political might to force the measure through the Senate We maintain our Market Perform rating on shares of EIX as we continue to believe the nearterm earnings and valuation are limited even if a bill ultimately passes Major Pharmaceuticals Charles Butler Timing of Xigris Panel Restrictions We are raising our peak sales estimate for Lillys sepsis drug Xigris to billion from billion The Lilly sepsis drug Xigris was scheduled to be reviewed at an FDA panel last Wednesday Due to the tragedies in both New York and Washington the panel did not convene However documents were made available on the FDA website regarding Lillys presentation and the FDAs interpretation Some have interpretated from the FDA documents that while Xigris will be approved it may have a more restricted label thus reducing potential demand q We spoke with two members of the Xigris team on Friday and have concluded that we do not believe a restricted label for the product will occur Leisure Felicia Rae Kantor A Mixed Bag We fully expect the leisure segment to be under pressure in the first few days of trading Fears of travel coupled with economic concerns do not bode well for the industry in general In this note we offer subsector by subsector a rational and logical snapshot of our universe with the hopes of helping investors reassemble the pieces of the puzzle after the terrible tragedy that occurred on PC Software Neil Herman Software sector in light of last week The events of last week increase the risk that potential customers will delay software purchases nearterm but should help longerterm as companies increase software spending particularly as they likely increase their focus on disaster recovery as well as reliable scalable and redundant systems q Veritas likely biggest beneficiary as about of its revenue is associated with data backup and recovery Advents dependence on the financial community puts it at risk nearterm q Inability to travel last week likely negatively impacted consultants billing time Enterprise SoftwareInternet Software Neil Herman Details of the Quarter On Thursday afternoon Oracle reported EPS of slightly exceeding our EPS estimate of and reported in the first quarter of the previous year The company reported total revenue of billion which fell from million in the same quarter a year ago Oracle was able to deliver from an operating margin perspective with the operating margin rising to an amazing from in the fiscal first quarter of Autos Auto Parts Nicholas Lobaccaro Auto Stocks Likely Among Hardest Hit GM and Ford Could Drop at least to based on DaimlerChryslers stock price reaction which fell by last week Industry fundamentals already weak will likely deteriorate significantly in the near term with sales and production likely to be disrupted GM and Ford hampered by low level of profitability and weak balance sheets before the tragic events of last week are vulnerable from a financial standpoint with access to credit likely to be more difficult than anticipated Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy as well as military action could set the stage for an eventual economic recovery perhaps as soon as late In the mean time business is likely to be extremely difficult Based on the stock price action during the Gulf War we expect a significant near term drop in stock prices with the prices not bottoming out for some time perhaps as long as months Wireless Services John Bensche Cell Phones In Unwanted Spotlight Wireless services networks were stressed to the limit by last weeks WTCPentagon disaster by enormous traffic levels While some facilities were damaged companies predicted no material impact to overall business conditions as a direct result The utility of wireless service showed itself in a very dramatic fashion in multiple situations and we may see some above average activation levels in the short run The impact of a sustained war on consumer spending and air travel is likely to be the largest factor for carriers over the longer term NOTES FROM TODAY Paper Forest Products Peter Ruschmeier Impact of Terrorist Attacks on Paper Ind Last weeks tragic events put a cloud over nearterm relative performance of paperforest product stocks but long term prospects remain favorable Within our universe we maintain confidence in our Strong Buy ratings on WY MEA and SPP Leveraged producers such as GP and SSCC may be vulnerable We would add to several Buyrated stocks that should benefit from a flight to quality especially BOW IP and W The prospect of war combined with a likely drop in consumer confidence and a potentially deep recession will likely lead to nearterm underperformance of shares of paper companies Longer term we believe numerous positive factors as highlighted in this note will allow shares to outperform We expect a flight to quality within the group Companies with the highest EBITDA margins TGP BOW WLL SPP the cleanest balance sheets MEA WLL WY SPP the greatest exposure to timberlands TGP WY WLL TIN and the lowest valuations based on EVmidcycle EBITDA SPP BOW LPX BCC should benefit Entertainment Stuart Linde Some Initial Thoughts The Entertainment industry may remain volatile in the wake of the most significant catastrophe in US history Advertising will undoubtedly be affected as will travel to destination parks Neither should be more than a reaction to this unprecedented tragedy and do not represent long term secular changes The Entertainment industry remains in strong financial shape with all large diversified entities having investment grade balance sheets Regulatory changes from the FCC are forthcoming which could further accelerate consolidation longterm Changes in programming have been put in place due to the events of last week such as the timing of certain sporting events a delay for TV season premieres and also for certain film releases Networks and TV stations have also continued commercial free news to assist their viewers in learning of continuous updates which will impact Q results In times of crisis certain segments of the Entertainment industry will outperform such as regional and in home entertainment Movie and home video rentalsales as well as TV viewership will permit an escape from the crisis at hand Banks Jason Goldberg North Fork Bk Return to share Repurchase We rate NFB Strong Buy With over of its revenues derived from spread income and projected aggressive Fed actions in the nearterm we expect solid results to continue despite disruption in the Manhattan marketplace We expect NFB to increase its share repurchase program by MM shares bringing its authorized repurchase to MM shares This represents of its outstanding shares and days of average trading volumes We also expect NFB to continue growing de novo in Manhattan and anticipate the Commercial Bank of New York acquisition to close in Q Pro forma of its Manhattan branches are below th Street one of which maybe consolidated after the acquisition closes NFB should benefit from its diverse lending portfolio We do not expect systems issues to hamper customer service or hurt results Satellite Communications

stock has been extremely weak down in the past month and trading at a week low of We view this pullback as a compelling buying opportunity Much of this decline is attributable to widespread speculation that Yahoo will not hit its Q estimates due to the eroding advertising outlook After carefully analyzing our forecast we believe that a significant shortfall is unlikely Our Q estimates already factor in the dotcom meltdown and the prolonged weak economy We recognize that Yahoos challenges are formidable and a reacceleration in growth may be a few quarters off However we believe that estimates are low enough and that the valuation has become much more reasonable We believe that the downside on the stock is limited and underpinned by the potential sale of the company Cable Communications Services L Warner Cox Comcast Terminate Home Relationship We believe that Coxs and Comcasts decision to end their relationships with ome will be very positive in the long term for both companies However we believe that the transition of service from At Homes infrastructure to a new infrastructure poses execution risk in the first half of Cox and Comcast notified ome that they will terminate their respective agreements with the company effective June This means that Cox and Comcast must migrate their high speed data customers from the ATHM platform to new platforms in the first

Mortgage acquisition On June st the company closed its acquisition of Fleet Mortgage The transaction has propelled WaMu to the rank in mortgage servicing and rank in loan originations based on volumes Despite a small uptick last week refinance activity continues to decline We believe that ARM lenders like WaMu have weathered the boom well and are positioned for additional balance sheet growing

placed in the company have eroded We believe in successive quarters starting with Q Gilat will be able to increasingly demonstrate that its business is in fact profitable and stable Longterm we find it hard to imagine how Gilat cannot play a meaningful role in the evolution of satellite broadband since it effectively created the enterprise and consumer equipment technology along with Hughes that

thesis that Orbital Sciences is on track to build value through improvements in its core satellite manufacturing and launch services businesses Orbital has successfully divested all of its noncore

peers because of satellite TVs strength in rural markets However a relatively more mature rural market and a weaker economic model relative to Hughes and EchoStar have caused the company to recently switch its focus to preserving its bottom line in lieu of growth New DirecPCbased broadband model should be a nearterm plus Survivability disagreement with DIRECTV could go to trial in early If Hughes

Amort is higher due to acquisitions The main question is how customers such as HP two days ago can be lowering forecasts for PC demand and talking about increasing weakness in Asia and Europe with

benefit from a less competitive personal lines market Unlike its competitors Allstate did not participate as much in the fierce price wars of the late s It therefore remained profitable on an

odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only bp next Tuesday At this stage Lehman Brothers economists still think the odds favor a bp cut given the underlying weakness in the economy particularly in

turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle which commences May with presentations from the major Networks lasting through May The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market Ad
