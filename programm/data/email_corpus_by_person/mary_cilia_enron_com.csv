<785582.1075862295872.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.cilia@enron.com,2001-09-26 12:44:39,EOTT Gain Calculation Cc Based on discussions with Bill there are deferred taxes already recorded on the books for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis in the common units sub units and APIs Therefore there is no punitive tax expense created in the rd quarter by executing the transaction The book tax calculations will be just the effective tax rate approximately multiplied by the pretax book gain Accordingly the tax expense will not result in a nonrecurring loss on the sale The net gain will be approximately million prior to the effects of the EGM MTM income Let me know if you have any questions Thanks Mary
