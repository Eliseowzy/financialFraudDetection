ease some certainly not all the fears of many western House members and Senators Original Message From Novosel Sarah Sent Wednesday September PM To Lay Kenneth Whalley Greg Frevert Mark Kean Steven J Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Nicolay Christi L Fulton Donna Shelk John Shortridge Pat Long Chris Presto Kevin M Davis Mark Dana Mayes Tomasine Will Lloyd Broderick Paul J Lindberg Susan Subject FERC Meeting Summary The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

ease some certainly not all the fears of many western House members and Senators Original Message From Novosel Sarah Sent Wednesday September PM To Lay Kenneth Whalley Greg Frevert Mark Kean Steven J Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Nicolay Christi L Fulton Donna Shelk John Shortridge Pat Long Chris Presto Kevin M Davis Mark Dana Mayes Tomasine Will Lloyd Broderick Paul J Lindberg Susan Subject FERC Meeting Summary The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or

would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of

access efforts but thought Id pass it along Pat Power to the Consumer How Direct Access to Electric Power Serves the Interests of Consumers and the California Economy by Dr Benjamin Zycher The following provides key research findings from a forthcoming study by Dr Benjamin Zycher which the Pacific Research Institute will publish in fall There are several points that are of special concern to California lawmakers and consumers given the current debate over direct access and the upcoming Public Utilities Commission vote on August These include Direct access is the right of electricity consumers to purchase electric power services from any supplier they choose Direct accesscompetition among supplierswill increase the scope of competitive pricing and service reliability Californias electric power system cannot be reformed toward competitive conditions without direct access Direct access will reduce the degree to which future policy decisions can politicize electric rates By furthering competitiveness and reliability direct access will strengthen economic conditions in California Efficient Policies and the LongTerm Interests of Californians Californiathe most populous state and the fifthlargest economy in the worldneeds efficient and reliable electric power As recent events show efficient delivery of electric power cannot be taken for granted in the Golden State The longterm interests of California demand public policies that will serve to ensure an efficient and reliable electric power sector Public policies chosen in pursuit of an efficient and reliable electric power sector in California will serve the interests of consumers in terms of reasonable and competitive prices both for electric power services themselves and for the myriad other goods tied to them They will serve the interests of the utilities and power producers in terms of a reduction of the risks perceived as attendant upon large investments in electric power infrastructure Indeed the interests of consumers utilities and producers are largely consistent in that greater risks yield both higher prices and reduced economic returns over time Such policies will serve the interests of workers by increasing investment in both the electric power sector itself and also more broadly across the California economy thus increasing employment opportunity the stock of capital and wages And accordingly they will serve the interests of taxpayers and government agencies by expanding the tax base The Efficiency of Direct Access That the interests of consumers are served by competitive pricing is widely recognized a truism that holds because such a price structure combined with the profit motive yields efficiencythe highestvalued aggregate output of goods and servicesin the use of economic resources that are limited always and everywhere That is why an artificially low price for any given good perhaps counterintuitively is inconsistent with that efficiency goalthe interests of consumersin that it yields resource use either too great in the short run or too small in the sector of interest and thus prices in other sectors either too high or too low respectively and therefore an aggregate output total smaller than possible The opposite problem is attendant upon prices that are uncompetitively high This in brief is what it means to say that price distortions yield resource misallocation The ability of consumers to choose among alternative suppliers is a crucial market constraint yielding competitive pricing This general condition can be complicated by the possible presence of scale economies in some marketsthere may exist a tradeoff between competitive effects and cost effects on pricebut the general efficiency of competition among sellers and buyers is straightforward and sufficiently familiar that it will not be expanded here Somewhat more subtlebut equally importantare the efficiency benefits yielded by that same ability of consumers to choose among alternative suppliers in markets in which legislatures or government agencies play a significant role in the determination of prices In the context of the market for electric power that ability is termed direct access that is the right to enter contracts for electric power services directly with a power supplier chosen by the buyer This is true whether government implements the rate setting function in a traditional public utility regulatory process or for some other set of reasons attempts to impose prices upon consumers or some subset thereof higher than otherwise obtainable This could be for the purpose of recovering past or future stranded costs as is likely to be the case in California due to the effects of the retail price controls imposed by AB and the attendant debts owed by the investorowned utilities or the prices imbedded in the new power contracts approved by the Department of Water Resources which may prove uneconomically high over time Dealing with such costs is a worthy goala solution involving the state budget is far more likely to prove efficientbut doing so by denying direct access in effect is an endorsement of uncompetitive pricing by government that would never be viewed favorably were it attempted by the private sector through a collusive arrangement Even without the problem posed by such stranded costs governmental involvement in determination of the rate level and structure introduces powerful incentives under democratic institutions generallyand indirect democracy in particularto use rates as a vehicle with which to transfer wealth among interest groups geographic regions and economic sectors Such politicized rate setting in the absence of enforced constitutional constraints is the inevitable outcome of democratic competition within political institutions In the absence of direct access political processes will bestow artificially low rates upon some consumers with the costs spread across other consumers For the economy as a whole this outcome is highly inefficientthe losses greatly exceed the gainsbut public decision making public choice nonetheless is driven toward it because the benefits are more concentrated politically than the costs and because public decision makers particularly under term limits are likely to have time horizons shorter than those relevant for the economy as a whole In short just as consumer choice is a powerful constraint upon uncompetitive pricing generally direct access in the context of the electric power market is an important institution constraining the natural incentive of government institutions to transfer wealth through a politicized rate structure The proscription of direct access therefore analytically is a collusive arrangement under which government prevents a particular and important form of competition and the longerterm effect is to prevent true deregulation because the latter would destroy the politicized rate structure and attendant wealth transfers California cannot have an efficient electric power sector without direct access Moreover a transition from the current industrial structureas shaped by the historical regulated system by AB attendant PUC policies and subsequent policy adjustments and by market expectations about future policies and market conditionscannot be implemented without direct access Such a transition requires market prices yielding efficient investment incentives but the absence of direct access facilitating a rate structure designed to transfer wealth among groups is inconsistent with that goal Without direct access a transition away from substantial rate regulation will be difficult or impossible Hazards of Industrial Structuring through Political and Regulatory Processes By the early s the traditional system of PUC rate regulation in California had yielded electricity prices roughly half again as high as those in the rest of the US The evolution of the electric generation system under regulatory incentives and constraints had resulted in substantial economic inefficiency in terms of siting total capacity the capacity mix distribution and other central parameters The regulated rate structure inexorably shaped by political pressures engendered large crosssubsidies among economic sectors geographic regions and consumer groups And the processes of regulatory permitting and public policy formulation that had evolved over time can be described as highly politicized and rife with delay At the same time technological advance and market forces were creating important competitive pressures in both generation and transmission and distribution with respect to which traditional regulatory and policy processes were poorly suited and inconsistent These underlying trendscoupled with the severe recession through which California suffered during the early simposed substantial costs upon the California economy and created powerful incentives for adverse business location decisions The policy response of the California state government was AB and a series of related PUC initiatives on contracting and vertical deintegration of the electric utilities In summary California implemented a partial deregulation that whatever the political compromises necessary for enactment yielded highly inefficient pricing at both wholesale and retail levels an inefficient industrial structure in the electric power sector an inefficient and costly allocation of risk a large implicit tax on electricity consumption disproportionate costs imposed upon the business sector and other adverse effects Because of retail price controls and until the defeat of Proposition in delays in permit filings for the construction of new generating capacity as well as other factors important shortages emerged in the response to which has been the actual and effective bankruptcies of PGE and Edison respectively Other effects include the imposition of a system of price controls and a sharply growing involvement of the state government which generally will introduce important rigidities In particular it will politicize the market further in part because of the pressures to use rate structures to transfer wealth and in part because of the political incentives of public decision makers facing time horizons substantially shorter than those relevant for the economy as a whole Direct access allows consumers to avoid such effects in whole or in part That is why it is a necessary component of a policy designed to move California toward economic efficiency in the market for electric power Conclusion The longterm interests of electricity consumers producers taxpayers and the state government are broadly consistent in terms of efficient prices reliable service investment risk reduction a market freed from political constraints and in terms of economic growth and taxbase expansion Direct access is the right on the part of buyers to enter contracts for electric power services directly with a power supplier chosen by the buyer Just as consumer choice is a powerful constraint limiting uncompetitive pricing generally direct access in the context of the electric power market is an important institution constraining the natural incentive of government institutions to transfer wealth among groups through a politicized rate structure California cannot have an efficient electric power sector without direct access and indeed cannot implement an effective transition process toward an efficient system without direct access Efforts by public decision makers to design industrial structures are ill advised and likely to yield serious unintended consequences and inefficiency costs This outcome is likely in part because the efficient evolution of a market structure is driven by subtle and complex market forces understood only imperfectly by economists and even by market participants themselves It is also likely because the compromises needed to forge policies can yield efficient market structures only by accident even if understood well Political processes simply cannot respond well to technological advances and other important shifts reflected in market behavior and prices These underlying conditions reinforce the short and longterm advantages of direct access an institution facilitating the operation of competitive market forces Dr Benjamin Zycher is a
