Inline attachment follows From Hirstcom To Hirstcom Date Wednesday August GMT Subject Dear Colleague The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper The California Electricity Crisis Lessons for Other States which I wrote The paper is available on the Publications page of my website wwwEHirstcom Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper Here is a summary of the paper California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future That future as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants Although the first two years of restructuring beginning in April seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disaster for Californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilities Part of the fallout from Californias electricity crisis is considerable concerneven oppositionin other states to restructuring the electricity industry Although a few states have decided based on the California experience not to restructure I believe that is the wrong outcome Instead the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work competition is not to blame for Californias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand and prices affect market outcomes Section of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May Section the heart of this paper offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry This section makes several points Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads Ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loads maintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support large regional markets and provide fuel to power plants Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamicpricing and voluntaryloadreduction programs ie couple retail and wholesale markets Create honest retail competition avoid standardoffer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ancillary services and transmission congestion Monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation and vertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission Ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improve reliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options But this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern hightech society electricity is our most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment Also electricity truly is a realtime product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the longterm benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible shortterm problems that may occur They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state Finally competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and pricerisk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers Eric Eric Hirst
