<17528965.1075852803895.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.brand@enron.com,2001-10-25 14:20:14,OptionsMr Lay First I want to say that Ive been a dedicated employee of Enron for yea rs now and looking back over that time its been the greatest period of m y life careerwise When I first went to work for Enron I was almost sta rry eyed I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates t company I had ever been associated with I started out with Enron Power Corp and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible Ive seen a lot of change over the past years Some great some good and some not so good But all in all I would do it all over again in a heart beat because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our management have made But most of all weve still got great people Base d on the current events of the past to months it does indeed look like we are going to have to do it all over again However I am an eternal optimist Looking at this in football terms this is a rebuilding year and weve got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich Kinder exuded I was saddened to see Mr Kinder move on but I was confide nt that having you remain behind would continue our successes And we have been successful Aside from the LJM issue which to be honest I still d ont fully understand I think weve just had some external distractions t hat have hampered our stock growth this year such as Dabhol Portland Gene ral California etc in addition to the market conditions in general In the allemployee meeting you told the troops that it was going to take the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going i n the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess I am full y prepared to do this however there is one request I would like to bring up I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are goi ng to expire at the end of this year In all my wildest dreams or nightma res I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threate n a grant price of but here we are As a dedicated and confident employee I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications around me that the stock would go to Later in the year as the stock moved downward I heard indications that we were going to bounce back stro ng I was on board I was excited I trusted that this was the case In fact I look back on this past year and based on what I knew at the time I would probably do the same thing over again But that was then and this is now It has been painful for me as I k now it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company I wan t to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end My request is simple is there any way possible to extend options expi ring at the end of this year by one year If you want to make a good faith gesture towards longtime employees who ar e willing to rededicate themselves to the daunting task at hand I can thi nk of nothing better for the short term I think extending the expiration date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee popu lation who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourse lves in If you cant do anything I will understand I know your office has always had an open door policy with respect to email feedback but this is the f irst one Ive ever written I always contend that it never hurts to ask in a situation like this Mark
