<15341629.1075860517582.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kenton.erwin@enron.com,2000-02-23 01:18:00,Upcoming Feb Broadwing hearing in Laramie state court our responses to Broadwings defenses and counterarguments Cc my preliminary thoughts about Broadwings likely responses to our claims and how we might respond to them Id like to discuss these with you Dave sometime this week as well as your thoughts about the likely course of the arguments Id also invite Brad and Ron to add to or modify my statements below if they are not accurate Dave and Steve now that were in this thing I want to hit as hard as we can taking full advantage of the shock value of these truly awful facts and do everything reasonably possible to obtain a preliminary injunction stopping Broadwings construction or at the very least ordering them to stop construction in Wyoming and if possible in Colorado until they have executed and complied with a construction coordination agreement Broadwing Arguments As to several cuts EBS refused to even mark their line Answer True as to the first two cuts only and even in those cases Broadwings contractor continued ripping us up when they should have stopped it is their obligation to protect our system no matter what we do EBS line wasnt properly marked The line weaves left and right and was marked as if it were laid in a straight line Answer True in some cases but Broadwings contractor was the same company that laid EBS line only a few months earlier and therefore knew the location of EBS line Also Broadwing knows that the sloping and rocky terrain causes the plow to wander somewhat and Broadwing knew especially after the first few cuts that it was too close to EBS line Note to Dave Should we have named our own locating service We have discussed a claim against them earlier but I didnt think about whether they should have been named as a defendant What do you think It doesnt relate to the injunction does it but it does relate to the damage action EBS didnt have enough inspectors out to protect its system Answer EBS did have inspectors nearby though we cannot have a person with every plow at every minute In some cases where our inspector told the Broadwing contractor to stop work because the EBS cable was in danger of imminent harm Broadwing did not stop and the cable was cut So it isnt clear that more inspectors would have helped since Broadwing ignored them anyway Some cuts must be expected when a cable is being laid close to an existing cable Answer The number of Broadwing cuts or and growing is far and above the usual number that would be anticipated Clearly Broadwing has been negligent in its disregard for EBS existing facility All Broadwing wants to do is the push through quickly Its contractors clearly behave in a negligent manner For example when we hired Mears Construction in Texas and they cut another companys cable they stopped and immediately examined the damage contacted the cables owner and offered to repair the damage When Mears was working for Broadwing in Wyoming however and Mears cut the EBS cable Mears didnt contact EBS and kept on working and even kept on damaging additional EBS facilities EBS damages are only its actual cost to repair the cuts Answer No first there have been so many cuts that EBS must in some cases replace entire segments of cable because too many splice repairs results in too much communications signal loss which is very expensive per reel of cable Also EBS is close to lighting its system ie carrying traffic when that happens EBS damages will be consequential lost profits lost additional business lost business reputation etc Uinta County is the true culprit since it forced us to be only away from EBS cable Answer It is true that the countys proximity requirement contributed to the problem That requirement is bad engineering practice but results from the countys overarching desire to maximize right of way revenue at all costs without regard to actual construction realities Unfortunately the county is immune Broadwing however is still responsible for protecting existing facilities and is clearly responsible for all damages that result There are numerous construction measures that Broadwing could and should have taken to reduct the risk of damaging the EBS line for example it should have dug periodic potholes to find out exactly where the line was in order to avoid it It could have dug trenches to lay the cable wherever it was too close for plowing In every case Broadwing merely did what was easist and cheapest without regard to EBS lines security This is not acceptable construction practice it is instead the practice of a flybynight operation that does not demonstrate basic regard for others property Broadwing is committed to avoiding any damage to EBS facilities Answer That is completely untrue While Broadwing has made numerous statements to EBS personnel which indicate that this is true Broadwings statements to EBS have repeatedly been proved to be either knowingly false statements or based on misunderstood inaccurate reports from its own field personnel Broadwing refused to sign or even to negotiate a construction coordination agreement which EBS supplied to Broadwing which is designed to promote communication and cooperation and prevent further damage EBS signed such an agreement with ATT after EBS contractor cut ATTs cable EBS has exhausted all its options with Broadwing and must have relief from the court The timing of this hearing is critical as EBS is about to light up its system and cannot do so until the new cable is installed to replace all the cut cable and will suffer much greater damages once EBS traffic is interrupted Kenton

<32360375.1075860518135.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kenton.erwin@enron.com,2000-02-29 12:45:00,Good Progress in IXCBroadwing Litigation PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT AND ATTORNEYCLIENT PRIVILEGED Cc from desolate windy Laramie Today we finished the second day of our hearing on our request for a preliminary injunction against Broadwing regarding all its cuts of our system in WY and CO We put on our rd thru th witnesses today including me regarding EBS background attempts to secure a construction coordination agreement and our irreparable harm and Brad regarding the cuts industry norms in avoiding damage to existing facilities and other topics Broadwing then put on its own inhouse attorney Before we could crossexamine him he made some inaccurate statements that we were champing at the bit to address the judge broke in to say that we would reconvene Friday morning to finish Broadwings case and then have closing arguments The judge warned both parties though that he was disgusted with all the cuts and all that cable being ripped out of the ground and said he was very disappointed that the two companies couldnt resolve this problem on their own I think the judge really liked the concept of a construction coordination agreement such as the one we signed with ATT which we described in detail and it bothered the judge a lot I think that Broadwing wouldnt negotiate such an agreement with us The judge looked at Broadwings counsel and said Believe me if you come back to this hearing on Friday and havent settled this matter one of you will go away very unhappy from my courtroom it will be very expensive for you He then left the courtroom but returned a moment later to add Listen to me if you dont settle this yourselves it will cost you a whole lot more than the cost to pothole cable across the whole state of Wyoming Pretty strong stuff from a judge during the middle of a hearing Then the judge left for good and the Broadwing folks came over to us while trying to act cool they seemed rattled by their perception that the judge was warning them to settle with us or else be shut down via injunction I told them that we wanted to settle the matter if we could do so and still protect our system I reminded them that they had already broken their earlier promise to us that if our inspectors said Broadwings plow was too close to EBS cable Broadwings contractor would stop construction until all parties agreed it was safe to restart so I wasnt sure how EBS could get comfortable with any new Broadwing promise We all agreed to try to negotiate a settlement agreement starting tomorrow Our side then broke for dinner and to plan strategy We hope that Broadwing will be motivated to make some accommodation with us although they and their counsel have shown us that they are quite capable of being irrational Our wish list is our construction coordination agreement Broadwing pays our actual costs for temporary and permanent repairs of cuts such repairs and cable replacement being at our discretion Broadwing pays a liquidated damage amount were thinking of asking for per cut but would probably settle for less Ted can you give me a damage number that might fairly reflect our loss of reputation and lost business if Broadwing cuts us again while were lit and serving customers we come to a settlement agreement by early afternoon Thursday so well have time to set travel plans for the Friday hearing Steve Black one of our two HH lawyers is preparing a first draft of an EBS proposal while we fly back to Portland tomorrow morning An important point Broadwing still has to put on most of its case if we dont settle It is possible that the tide could turn though unlikely It is even possible that all persons present for both sides misinterpreted the judges leaning or the judge could change his mind For those reasons I would love to secure a good settlement while our leverage seems the greatest The elimination of the remaining litigation risk in my mind is worth giving up some of our wish list I would like to tell you David that Brad was excellent I didnt know about his long experience in teaching classes on cable installation etc that experience was most impressive in our proving that Broadwing has grossly departed from industry standards Our counsel both stated and I agree that Brad came across as confident and knowledgeable and he established strong credibility We didnt have time to put Ron on but his comments and help with strategy were most helpful Our contractors with the line locating service and Mr Beamis were all terrific we should give them some nice Enron present after this is over its my understanding that they lost opportunities to work and be paid by agreeing to testify for us and they were very motivated strong allies Steve and Dave our Holland and Hart lawyers are excellent They picked the right judge have the right experience and have good intuition All in all I think our effort was well worthwhile and was done right For my money Enron came off looking professional and reasonable and Broadwing came off looking like a cheap flybynight My deep thanks to all of you who contributed to this effort Please make sure that everyone in your respective groups keeps a lid on any outside conversations about this lawsuit since its not over Heres hoping that we can strike a good settlement though Im not afraid of a Friday hearing Maybe its not over yet but it sure looks good from here Kenton
