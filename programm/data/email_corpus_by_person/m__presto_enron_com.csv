o n contract intent With respect to No and No the answer is absolutely NO as they are material changes to the contract that have significant value issues Sinc e I personally requested these changes to the original contract in the neg otiation process I know what the contract intent was and continues to be If AEP is still the equity buyer they have complete control over the grid curtailment and associated termination risk in item No since they are the transmission owning utility in the region The total EPMI PPA as of COB value is currently million My e stimate for PPA value erosion for amendments No and No is milli on Obviously the erosion value is somewhat subjective however the t ransmission riskgrid curtailment risk on this project is significant and t he termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what cou ld be substantial downside for EPMI The reason I had Mike ensure this pr ovision was in the current PPA was to shift some of that risk back to Enron Wind and now Enron Wind is trying to push it to the project lenders who a lso dont want the risk Original Message From Lindholm Tod A Sent Mon PM To Presto Kevin M Curry Mike Lamb John Payne Michael Cc Murphy Harlan Kitchen Louise Subject RE Amendment to IM II PPA Kevin EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi nanced and sold All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit y purchaser have been dropped and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu ction I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t o the deal Banking Provisions EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en ergy credits RECS produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would on a cumulat ive basis offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years Section of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties This section origina lly provided for the carryover but in an effort to simplify the language the aggregate carryover concept was clouded Both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o f the carryover banking provisions EPMIs most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI drafted the contract with specific pro visions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment Section There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere d under the termination provision relating to force majeure under Section This inconsistency is the problem Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment The propos ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of t he PPA be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments This clarification is consistent wi th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal EPMI Credit Support EPMIs obligations under the PPA are guaranteed by Enron The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain affiliates without consent of the seller Any assignment by EPMI would n ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract and the Enr on guarantee would remain in place However the project lenders have requ ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as Enron Corps credit quality The project lenders have also requested t hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corps since that i s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA This will not affe ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga tion unless released by the project Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu e declaratory relief under arbitration Our sense is that this does nothin g but ensure delay From an Enron perspective The sale of the equity and the financing of the nonrecourse debt on t he Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrou nding the ambiguities in the PPA While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place d ifferent offtaker the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale of the Indian Mesa II project If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month Enron will likely end up with approximately M less cash at year end than it counted on in

Kennewick My Dad retired from teaching in WA collecting WA retirement and has been teaching in Hermiston OR for the last years Just to clarify Enrons international business model and North American business model are quite different I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US Enron NAs focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas power crude pulp paper metals etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs Enrons international business model on the other hand entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities This model is OK provided the business risk currency risk international risk change in law risk legal risk etc is priced properly by the debt and equity providers I will let you conclude which business model is better I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a freemarket model Later Original

this email found you it was a shot in the dark Glad to hear that you are doing well You have a better memory than mine but I believe that you are right The last time that I did see you was at the wedding That was a long time ago I have not stayed in touch with anyone from that area Although my parents still live outside of Pasco I havent been to the TriCities in years though since my family usually meets in Seattle where my sisters live Do your parents still live in the TriCities How do you like Houston I almost moved there a couple of years ago to take a job with Unocal Since the last time I saw you I went to the UW for undergrad and then headed East to go to grad school at the University of Virginia where I did a MA in international affairs and econ I gravitated to the DC area for international work where I have remained since then I worked for the International Finance Corporation with the World Bank for about five years covering investments in South Asia The travel to India was fun but a little crazy at times I would inevitably get sick when I went there The early s was an interesting time to be in India as the country was just starting to privatize If you were in Bombays financial district you would still see piles of notes being wheeled around in rickshaws to the stock exchange I eventually left the IFC Wall Street hours wo the pay and moved to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation where I spent about five years doing partial risk guarantees for Turkey and that region I encountered Enrons project finance team in Houston and your DC rep John Hardy Enron has a plant in Turkey for which OPIC guaranteed and provided financing Enron wasis one of OPICs largest clients receiving support for Dabhol etc However I know that Enron is now pulling back from these types of ventures which is where your work is focussed I gather It must be an interesting job I would like to hear more about it I havent really followed Enrons move into the power trading sector I just changed jobs about a month ago and now work at Fannie Mae still in DC buying and pricing mortgagebacked securitizations I cover the West Coast and Dallas area It is a big switch from IFC and OPIC bc it is all domestic so my boondoggles to Turkey etc have been cut off So far I like the company I had worked on providing wraps on bonds to mitigate some sovereign risks for emerging market issuers while at OPIC I spent a fair amount of time with capital market investors and investment banks so I made the move to Fannie Mae to concentrate specifically on the secondary market Ill probably roll this experience into international structured transactions in a year or two Im also doing my MBA at Georgetown right now It should be a busy yearCAE wrote You have the right Kevin Presto I have been employed at Enron now for almost years I currently oversee the companys power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US Unfortunately I spend entirely too much time at work but I love the

although it is not perfect it is a big improvement over what we have today Therefore I and my team support Enrons endorsement of the PJM Proposal with your timeline condition Thanks for all your good work Original Message From Novosel Sarah SentWednesday September PM ToPresto Kevin M Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Lin da Fromer Howard Allegretti Daniel Hoatson Tom SubjectRE Support of PJMs Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO Kevin I think the PJM proposal looks pretty good as a first step As we discusse d in Houston the proposal gives us a single dayahead and real time energy market for the entire Northeast but it does not get us everything at firs t For example on Day One PJM proposes to retain the existing control areas and allow the individual control areas to redispatch in the real time market for local transmission constraints This could result in New York continuing to manipulate the market in an attempt to keep prices down but as we discussed in Houston and as Andy Ott has confirmed it is highly un likely that PJM will allow New York to continue this type of market interfe rence once PJM is in charge and running the market Also by leaving some of the existing systems in place PJM has aptly responded to the New York a rgument that local reliability in New York must be maintained so that Ne w Yorks opposition is seen for what it is an attempt to delay indefinit ely an RTO in the Northeast Enrons support of the PJM proposal would be very helpful in mediation sinc e we are seen as a big player in the region and because the other two propo sals on the table are sponsored by the New York TOs and the New York ISO an d envision a new RTO system based on the PJM Platform changed by asyet u ndefined Best Practices from the other two ISOs and New York has indicat ed it thinks a lot of its market design is a best practice and these ot her options will not begin operation for years at best Nevertheless even though we here in Washington think the PJM proposal look s good it is important that you and your team are also comfortable with it If you all have not had an opportunity to review the proposal to ensure that you are satisfied with it then I would propose that we not sign Enron s name onto the proposal We can talk about the proposal in more detail a nd even have Andy Ott available for a conference call or a trip to Houston to answer any questions you may have If you need more time then I think we should follow this route instead even if it means we cannot lend our su pport for PJM at this time Please let me know what you think Sarah

attached As you may recall I gave yo u a copy of PJMs proposal and we discussed it when I was in Houston a coup le of weeks ago The main concern with PJMs proposal is its timing the ir time line provides for an implementation date of November We have talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation process and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively but they are unwi lling to change their target date in their proposal Because we disagree with the PJM date we propose to have Enron Power Marke ting Incs name included on the list of supporters of the proposal with the following footnote While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance of PJMs proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein Enron Power Marketing Inc dissents from PJMs date of November fo r implementing the single RTO in the Northeast Enron believes that the PJ M proposal can and must be implemented by December and that extensi on of the implementation date past December is unnecessary and contrar y to the Commissions RTO policy established in Order No This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJMs timing in comm ents to

about this if you desire JC Original Message From Presto Kevin M Sent Friday September AM To Cummings John Subject RE REFCO Project Update With respect to East Power markets I would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bidoffer in return for Refcos access to our markets Original Message From Cummings John Sent Thursday September PM To Nowlan Jr John L Arnold John Presto Kevin M Goughary Jim Wilson John L Belden Tim Cc Eichmann Marc Richter Brad Shults Bob Subject REFCO Project Update Gentlemen I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all Unfortunately Refcos headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse They suffered no human losses from the disaster but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability To briefly summarize the discussion so far ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refcos customers Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit Refco The products contemplated include various Nymex lookalike products and other liquid swaps in oil natural gas and electricity Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform transaction fees and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor FitzgeraldEspeed All that being said they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in weeks Attending will be Gary Weiss SVP Refco Group Ltd LLC and President CEO of Refco FX Ltd LLC and Joe Murphy CEO Refco Futures Ltd LLC The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business and discuss the possible structure of the deal The meeting is scheduled to begin at pm Thursday Oct and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when I realize there are significant issues to be addressed Refco currently has some collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors locals down to individuals We have put these into buckets which have different profiles Phase would include the Top accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors locals and high net worth individuals If this proves successful phase would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them they become Eligible Contract Participants ECPs able to execute derivatives So they believe that the majority of the accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit Please do not hesitate to contact me at x if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback Regards John Cummings

NAPERVILLE Ill June PRNewswire Local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers IBEW AFLCIO announced that its members went on strike against Midwest Generation EME LLC today at am The unions decision to strike comes after several months of unsuccessful negotiations with representatives of the Californiabased unit of Edison International Co Local had proposed a collective bargaining agreement that would retain the ordinary and customary practices and the arbitration awards that have been in place for years The union also proposed maintaining the progressive discipline procedure that was contained in the previous contract In response Midwest Generation told union negotiators that it would reject the unions entire proposal which includes the retention of existing procedures Because we have proposed no new language its unclear what Midwest Generation is trying to accomplish beyond a strike said William H Starr President and Business Manager of Local IBEW We understand given the fact that Midwest Generation is part of a financially troubled California power corporation that there are concerns about Midwest Generations ability to operate and maintain its Illinois operations However during the course of our negotiations Midwest Generation representatives informed Local that there was nothing in the unions proposal that would hurt the companys revenues or profitability in todays competitive marketplace Local is also troubled by Midwest Generations misrepresentations of the unions position in this dispute For example Local proposed no contract language to impede or limit the companys use of outside contractors And it is Midwest Generation not Local that after months of refusing to come to the bargaining table has also refused to bargain in good faith Formal negotiations began one week after Midwest Generation was forced to sign a settlement agreement with the National Labor Relations Board NLRB Region on June The settlement required the company to meet and bargain in good faith with Local for a new contract The previous contract had expired on March On May Local announced its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against Midwest Generation with voting in favor of the strike authorization By working without a contract since April our members have demonstrated that they are absolutely dedicated to maintaining service for the Illinois communities that rely on power from Midwest Generation facilities said Starr However because the company has refused to accept reasonable proposals offered by Local we are forced to strike It is unfortunate that Midwest Generation has so little regard for its employees the livelihood of our members and their families and the people of Illinois We are disappointed but we will continue to fight for a new contract that is fair reasonable and mutually beneficial Local members have established picket lines outside of each of Midwest Generations seven fossilgenerating stations in Northern Illinois The plants supply approximately of the electrical power capacity in the Chicago area They are Crawford Station S Pulaski Road Chicago Fisk Station W Cermak Road Chicago Collins Station N side of Pine Bluff Road miles east of IL Rt Morris Joliet Station S Patterson Joliet Joliet Station Channahon Road Joliet Powerton Station miles south of Pekin off IL Rt on Manito Road Pekin Waukegan Station Greenwood Ave Waukegan Will County Station E Romeo Road Romeoville In Midwest Generation acquired the plants from Commonwealth Edison Co and entered into a purchase agreement that requires Midwest Generation to sell of the power it generates at peak production to ComEd ComEd in turn sells the power to about million customers in the Chicago area Several months after Midwest Generation acquired the plants the company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Local IBEW effective from December until March Local International Brotherhood of

Victory Wounding of the Source to Sink Beast Yesterday at the Midwest ISO we successfully managed to quash the MISOs at least one sourcetosink reservation proposal MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on transmission reservations and felt that the Entergy SourceSink policy was too restrictive but the policy of not requiring sourcetosink at any point was too relaxed Their proposal was that at least one reservation on a tagschedule must have the true sourcetosink otherwise the tagschedule would be denied for improper use Representatives from CINergy Duke Dynegy ACES Ameren and LGE worked with me to fight this concept arguing that it was effectively identical to the Entergy SourceSink policy in almost all cases After a meeting and two conference calls in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually pressed for their option we finally managed to convince them that it was unacceptable The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation specified accurate source and sink the tagschedule will be approved If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink but analysis indicates the transaction can flow without compromising reliability the tagschedule will be approved If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink and analysis indicates the transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability ie the transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint the tagschedule will be denied While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want it allows us a great deal more flexibility that the Entergy SourceSink barrier while at the same time allaying the MISOs reliability concerns Effectively this allows us to redirect both firm and nonfirm at the time of taggingscheduling without a loss in transmission priority Not only will this give us more flexibility within MISO but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under the IRCA This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy SS policy is not required for reliability as other entities are able to meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are necessary As an aside we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will allow for partial redirects of service on a short term basis the Separate proposal referenced in the attached document This will allow us to accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy but reduce the availability risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is taggedscheduled These two proposals when combined will allow us for much more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change A detailed writeup of the work accomplished is attached Proposal

see s I dont think its appropriate to shut down anything We need to price the product properly and offpeak needs just as much margin as onpeak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth Rather than shut down products increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market We are chipping away at our offpeak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal Am I making sense In addition I am working with Doug to buy x from FPL in North Texas for both desks We will probably have to pay spread to get year x deal done With respect to NE the outright prices are

black hole called coal and have gotten even more bullish than I was when we spoke last I wanted to give you some initial reactions and hope that you will call to discuss your reaactions to my reactions if that make sense to you In looking at the MSHA data under a finer and finer slice I was somewhat surprised to see the purging of employees in NAPP and CAPP I have also been making the rounds in the major NAPP and CAPP basins to gauge the level of new activity but it is surprising how sluggish the rebound is and will be One could write that off to new problems with permitting intermittent streams has become a real problem I am told andor to hiring problems while fighting off the coal unions some more The other theory is that this oligopology that has gotten its sea legs I am leaning towards a theory that the latter will use the former for cover Given how bad EIA is that cover could last a while This market is ripe for a squeezing IF gas tightens a bit and net exports is somewhat inelastic at these levels Further it appears clear that aside from being horrible at managing data and the needs of the public EIA is incompetent at analysis I do not think we built inventory during Q it was mostly stocks producerdistributor moving to market I now understand why you were focusing upon my gas substitution comments The other area of opportunity is EXIM No doubt you have continued to see the drift in international freight and coal prices How low can it go EXIM we are in unchartered territory I know Hill Associates think that the US can become an importer over the longer pull The problem is the offloading at terminals what you load you cant necessarily offload and whose terminals they are Look at the ownership of the major terminals and you find coal producers I have told our gas guys that I am growing more confident that gas will gain ground from coal this time around for the structural reaons I gave you plus the fundamental reasons as well If todays AGA

the US between a private corporation and a university meteorology program is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows OU to expand its toptier meteorology programs while Williams receives exclusive weather analysis and forecasting tools This will give Williams a globally competitive advantage in energy marketing and trading while related educational and research activities are expected to produce for Williams the nations most qualified meteorologists and weather impact decision makers This is a partnership between business and higher education where both parties benefit Keith E Bailey Williams chairman president and CEO said This alliance provides Williams access to weather research and technology that is dramatically superior than traditional government weather services and customized to Williams unique needs With weather being the number one driver of volatility in gas and power markets we expect to see a significant return on our investment This history making agreement between Williams and the University of Oklahomas School of Meteorology a national leader in its field is a dramatic demonstration of the power of a private sectoruniversity partnership in the creation of economic productivity and growth and the expansion of knowledge said OU President David L Boren I predict that this alliance will become a national model for joining together American international leadership in higher education with private sector creativity and vitality We are deeply grateful for the confidence placed in this outstanding program at the University by Williams Highlights of this expansive agreement include Unique advanced weather and climate prediction capabilities tailored by the University of Oklahomas Weather Programs specifically for Williams weathersensitive businesses A grant of million over five years to fund research in advanced weather analysis and prediction at the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms CAPS This includes funding for a supercomputer that will be most powerful among all Big institutions A grant of million over five years to fund regional climate research at the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies This money will bring to OU the most advanced climate system model in the world and will fund research scientists as well as graduate and undergraduate students Gifts to create the Williams Endowed Chair an advanced student computer laboratory funding for three Williams Fellows in the Master of Science in Professional Meteorology Degree in the School of Meteorology and a gift to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey We believe the outcome of this partnership will yield a world class suite of weather forecast and analysis products suited for use in the energy marketing and trading industry says Denise Russell director of Market Analysis at Williams energy marketing and trading unit who in began to hire OU meteorology graduates We also will have a valuable pipeline for new technological and human resource capabilities with which to maintain these developments According to Dr John Snow dean of the OU College of Geosciences and director of Oklahoma Weather Center programs the School of Meteorology has already begun to aggressively recruit some of the nations top graduate students as part of the new partnership and will expand this effort in the next several months now that the contracts are signed Through this alliance with Williams The University of Oklahoma has obtained the resources necessary to continue generating new knowledge defining the global standard for weather technology and developing outstanding graduates all while bringing new jobs and opportunities to Oklahoma in weatherrelated fields says Snow The WilliamsOU alliance was made

Enpower system This is for informational purposes only Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any points Over the last few weeks a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower St Lukes Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses Ancillarys and ICAP The TD is a pass through We only tested one site out of the ten Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest structures available Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the same time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its current state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes minutes to save We booked months approx years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc took hours to book Since each deal type takes hours to book it takes a total of hours to book energy ancillarys only line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least four therefore the total booking time should be closer to hours Once we got a book to run it took minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accounting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently have an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting Currently this is done in a standalone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower All hedges will

Finished Excel Full Requirements model The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP The current ICAP curves are MWday and they are not

Rogers Richter Jeff SubjectFYI Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower To all The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system This is for informational purposes only Please let me k now if you have any questions or need clarification on any points Over the last few weeks a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower St Lukes Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal The dea l is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses A ncillarys and ICAP The TD is a pass through We only tested one site out of the ten Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest stru ctures available Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the s ame time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will hel p highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its curren t state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes minutes to save We booked months approx years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc too k hours to book Since each deal type takes hours to book it takes a total of hou rs to book energy ancillarys only line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least four therefore the total booking time should be closer to hours Once we got a book to run it took minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deal s Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accoun ting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation proce ss This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently ha ve an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting Currently this is done in a standalone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower All hedges will become desk to desk i nstead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower Position and PL reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS Here is a breakdown of what it took to rebook this trade Week May Read Contract Get Batch model as well as a breakdown of value between Energy Ancillary s etc Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model in Excel to check valuation Week May Continue working on Full Requirements model Work with Risk Management Stacey Whites group to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower Begin to book deal in Enpower Getting access to Enpower took some time Discovered that our assumption on hours for the x was incorrect We h ad gotten about of the deal booked by the time we realized this At times the database tables would run out of space because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database This would keep us from entering any new data Week May June Finished Excel Full Requirements model The EES Batch and the Wholesale mo del tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP The current ICAP curves are MWday and they are not calculated u sing the correct numbers of days ie June and July have the same MWday p rice even though there are and days respectively in each month This can be fixed in the curve files In the future we should mark the cur ves as Kwmonth Again we ran into problems with the test database Completed booking in Enpower Week June Took days to get a MTM valuation portcalc to work Discovered deal entry errors in booking

value greater than zero This portfolio I can update monthly for you or as often as you wish This is I feel the way that will give us the truest overall value of your stock options and it will also

value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio The restricted stock basis of is valued OK but the options are not In addition the
