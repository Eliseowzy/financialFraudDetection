Criteria The formula which defines the trading decisionmaking program will need to work with several criteriainputsdefinitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could

value for this might be Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible

<24515970.1075853996140.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.forster@enron.com,2000-07-20 12:13:00,New Version of Stack Manager Cc In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade Summary of New Features Multiple Children A Child product can be the Parent of another Child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single Parent Static Product Bar Prices When you change a price in the Product Bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in Product Properties until you logout Sorting You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on the title of the field For multiple sorts hold down your shift key Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified eg The Product bar might before have said Basis Link Parent and now would say Stand Alone Parent Detailed Feature Descriptions Multiple Children The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together in a long chain For example Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product B which is in turn linked to Parent Product C Warning Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains This is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request The database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks Vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than Flat chains One parent with many children Large vertical chains should be avoided Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent For example Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent Product B At the same time Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link to the same Parent Product B Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated Basis link and a regular Basis Link Static Product Bar Prices The new version of EnronOnline provides for sticky Product Bar price and volume changes When you change a number on the Product Bar it does not reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you have logged out This makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements With the old version of Stack Manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons Each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth This makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate Entering an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices a new field for Offset to Last Trade This allows you to update the offset for Products which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu SortingSelecting The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old You can now choose any field heading Type Location Reference Period etc and sort by that item You can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key Example If you select Type and then Location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by Product Type and then within each Product Type by Location in alphabetical order If you right click on the Product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select Sort by Web Order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing When you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the ctrl key while making your selections This allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another Parent Products and FX Products One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed The old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar to the left of the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs The new version does not show the type of link This is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product Some traders may notice that their products which have fx links are now identified with a stylised fx in the Product list This is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually Assistance As always if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality please contact the hour Help Desk Houston London Australia General Feedback If you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call David Forster on If you had previously suggested new functionality which didnt make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager

<16350260.1075854135718.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.forster@enron.com,2000-07-20 12:13:00,New Version of Stack Manager Cc In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade Summary of New Features Multiple Children A Child product can be the Parent of another Child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single Parent Static Product Bar Prices When you change a price in the Product Bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in Product Properties until you logout Sorting You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on the title of the field For multiple sorts hold down your shift key Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified eg The Product bar might before have said Basis Link Parent and now would say Stand Alone Parent Detailed Feature Descriptions Multiple Children The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together in a long chain For example Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product B which is in turn linked to Parent Product C Warning Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains This is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request The database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks Vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than Flat chains One parent with many children Large vertical chains should be avoided Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent For example Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent Product B At the same time Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link to the same Parent Product B Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated Basis link and a regular Basis Link Static Product Bar Prices The new version of EnronOnline provides for sticky Product Bar price and volume changes When you change a number on the Product Bar it does not reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you have logged out This makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements With the old version of Stack Manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons Each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth This makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate Entering an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices a new field for Offset to Last Trade This allows you to update the offset for Products which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu SortingSelecting The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old You can now choose any field heading Type Location Reference Period etc and sort by that item You can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key Example If you select Type and then Location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by Product Type and then within each Product Type by Location in alphabetical order If you right click on the Product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select Sort by Web Order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing When you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the ctrl key while making your selections This allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another Parent Products and FX Products One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed The old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar to the left of the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs The new version does not show the type of link This is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product Some traders may notice that their products which have fx links are now identified with a stylised fx in the Product list This is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually Assistance As always if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality please contact the hour Help Desk Houston London Australia General Feedback If you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call David Forster on If you had previously suggested new functionality which didnt make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager

customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing When you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the ctrl key while making your selections This allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another Parent Products and FX Products One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed The old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar to the left of the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs The new version does not show the type of link This is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product Some traders may notice that their products which have fx links are now identified with a stylised fx in the Product list This is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually Assistance As always if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality please contact the hour Help Desk Houston London Australia General Feedback If you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call David Forster on If you had previously suggested new functionality which didnt make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of

the language is similar to other EnronOnline Products which is good for consistency However I note that there has been a subsitution of Calculation Period where other products use Determination Period However I gather that for power Calculation Period is hour whereas for other Products Determination Period is generally one month I hope this does not cause problems if the GTC language has been borrowed from other Products Would the following amendments clarify the MWMwhCalculation Period relationship Current The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts MW via EnronOnline This number will be divided in half to convert it into MWh This number will be used to calculate the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period Suggestion The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts MW via EnronOnline This number will be divided in half to convert it into total MWh delivered in each hour Calculation Period which shall be the Notional Quantity Current The Index shall be the spot price at the Victoria Suggestion The Index shall be the spot price published for each hour at the Victoria Thanks Dave David NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Mark CT David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Allan FordENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description Mark I would like to thank you for your review of our draft product description The benefit of your experience is invaluable in assisting us to develop our forms I had a couple of reservations about some changes you proposed In particular the changes to the Swap product description would involve the Fixed and Floating Price in each Calculation Period half hour being averaged over a Settlement or Determination Period The payment obligation would then be multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period to get the amount payable on the Settlement Date This not the way electricity derivatives are traded on the Australian electricity pool In addition to being inconsistent with the terminology both within our documentation and industry agreed forms we would have difficulty in having this new trading form adopted by the market In brief in Australia electricity trades occur in the following manner Trades are calculated on the basis of discrete half hourly Calculation Periods Payment obligations for these Calculation Periods are then aggregated on Settlement Date each month The Settlement Date is defined as the day each month when parties are obliged to make payments under the National Electricity Code It is the market custom for the Notional Quantity to be quoted in MWs This number is then divided in half to calculate to convert it into MWhs which becomes the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period To ensure its consistency with market practice we have determined that amounts should be quoted in MWs then converted in this manner into MWhs This is explained in the product description Mark Taylor and myself discussed the principles that should be followed in preparing long form product descriptions Whilst we should endeavour for consistency in drafting and in terminology amongst products the primary concern is to ensure that the terms used in the long form descriptions are consistent with our GTCs other relevant contractual arrangements with the counterparties and market trading forms There are also practical reasons for adopting terminology used in a particular market We would have some difficulty in attempting to market EnronOnline to potential counterparties if we also simultaneously convince them to commence trading on another type of product Furthermore departure from agreed forms of trading will increase the transaction risk I would be interested in getting your views as we are planning to turn out a number of descriptions over the next week based on our original form Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Paul Smith PM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Allan FordENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have changed the description of the reference load shape for OffPeak and Flat trades Can you pls OK these before I proceed with other regions In the meantime I will use the original Peak template as the base for options Rgds Paul David Minns To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description The major change is the adoption of a new product into Australia The current arrangement is for trades to be effected in discrete minute Calculation Periods settled monthly in accordance with an the NEMMCO calendar What is proposed is for the floating amounts to to be averaged over a Settlement Period The implication is that the Average Floating Amount is this the Average Floating Price multiplied by the number of Calculation Periods This should equate to the same figure There are a couple of concerns This is not what is currently traded There are no definitions to cover these terms We would also have to amend the GTCs and existing ISDA Agreements to be able to trade this type of Product Apart from additional definitions issues such as rounding conventions for averaging would also need to be addressed We will need to educate potential counterparties as to this produce There is also a change to require counterparties to quote a volume per Settlement Period A figure is quoted in MW and then multiplied by the number of hours within the Settlement Period to get the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period Assuming this is limited to the number of hours within each Victorian NEM Peak during the Settlement Period it should work But there will need to be an explanation that the Average Floating Amount is the Average Floating Price multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period If we must adopt this form then we have no choice but I believe that it will cause difficulties in implementing EnronOnline We will need not only sell the system but also new products A further level of complexity will be added to trades as we attempt modify the current Australian market conventions Paul Smith AM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David Here is the response from Mark Comments Rgds Paul Forwarded by Paul SmithENRONDEVELOPMENT on Mark CT To David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have reviewed the language sent by Paul The description is broken down into paragraphs for the record Paragraphs all cover details usually covered in the Product Type description is actually settlement dates for which we do not have a separate attribute Paragraph is reference period Paragraph is Index Paragraph is loadshape These look fine to me subject to my observations on whether we can use the Averaging language Paragraph covers attributes currency looks fine and Unit of Measure for which I suggest we go with our current language for MWh which details that the volume submitted by the counterparty is MWh per hour The product type language does not refer to determination or settlement periods but calculation periods half hourly and then details the computation of volume for a calculation period If we are consistent with the approach used in other products we would refere to the average reference price being the index within a determination period and further define the determination period If we average this also changes the loadshape language I have attached a document with the language I would propose referring to averaging Paul I have reviewed the descriptions comparative to those already held for power financial swaps on the system David may have further comments David is not back until th Feb and you may wish to have your legal team consider if the averaging language can be used in Australia before he returns If it can not I suggest we could add the definition of determination period and state that the settlement amount is the aggregation of the amounts computed for all calculation periods within the determination period The second attachment purely takes the language from your document and orders it as it would appear assuming all the attribute descriptions are as per my breakdown above regards M Paul NRONDEVELOPMENT To David CT cc Mark CT Allan FordENRON

make the Agency presentation covering EnronOnline available on their website KevinJay Can you please try to identify the appropriate BEA contact as a matter of priority this morning RichardMark Please advise as to how strong we can be in warning BEA not to publish the information on their website Thanks Dave From Kevin Montagne AM To Richard B CT David CT Jay CT Philippe A CT Mark CT Louise CT cc Subject AGENCYCOM Presentation at BEA Users Conference Here is the information regarding the presentation done by AGENCYCOM The BEA Users Conference is being held in San Francisco CA The conference has over registered users representing many types of companies About the Session and Presentation On Wednesday February at an hour long session was to open to any registered conference attendee Around very rough guess people attended the session The session was moderated by Scott Dietzen CTO BEA Server Division and was described as Web ECommerce Solutions Using Best of Breed Technologies The session included panel members from Calico Commerce an ISV Idea Integration an integrator Cygent an ISV and AGENCYCOM Each of the panel members gave a minute presentation then the session was turned over for general questions and answers Joe Tatem of AGENCYCOM went last and spoke about the web development marketplace where it was and where it needed to head Like the other panel members he described his company and gave a little sales pitch for BEA Weblogic Tatem then presented a case study as an example of some of their work This example was of AGENCYCOMs work for Enron on EnronOnline His case study consisted of slides The first slide had screen images of EnronOnline one was the EnronOnline home page and the second was the quotes page populated with some products The quotes page was overlayed on the home page and obscured the EnronOnline banner on the bottom so that only the ne at the end showed The Enron logo the counterclockwise degree logo was clearly visible He talked about it being a Trading Extranet site but said he could not name the customer He described that real time prices for products were being displayed to customers He then showed the next slide which gave a high level overview of the application architecture for EnronOnline This slide contains details about real time server RTServer and its associated application server including the RMI communication mechanism He made a comment about how they were particularly proud of the real time piece and how it was designed and how it worked This slide also contained a reference to the fact EnronOnline uses Oracle i He also mentioned Jesica as the content management piece and indicated that they were looking at other rd party products to replace that in their future projects This slide also contains a reference to StackManager and he indicated that it was developed by the unamed client and not by AGENCYCOM He also talked about ShockWave plugin being used in the browser to receive the real time quotes Only one question was asked from the audience during his showing of the technical architecture slide This question paraphrased was When you use RMI between the web server and the app server how many connections do you use He replied paraphrased one per thread The questioner then asked something else that I assumed was a technical detail about how WebLogic RMI worked Tatem replied incorrectly and a BEA employee responded with the right answer About the Handouts of the Presentation BEA tried to make available hard copies of all presentation slides in each session They setup a series of shelves that were numbered for each session The documents were available starting Monday during the registration process and throughout the conference On Monday evening I went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which I was interested About a third of the handouts for the sessions were not available I did not notice whether the one for above mentioned presentation was available I did not expect it to one of the more interested ones During some of the sessions BEA handed out copies to those present I did not see any handed out during the above mentioned session After the session was over I called Jay Webb and told him of the above details After telling Jay I saw Scott Dietzen from BEA in the hallway I had met him twice before I told Dietzen that the presentation that AGENCYCOM did in his panel was about Enron We had already discussed the project with Dietzen when he visited our Houston office I told him that AGENCYCOM was not supposed to reveal any information concerning the project At this time I did not know that hard copies of the presentation were available I told Dietzen that if they did become available that the portion about EnronOnline should not be distributed Dietzen said he was not aware of the problem with discussing the project He apologized and said he would not distribute any handouts if he received them Sometime later on Wednesday I went to the rack of presentation handouts and there was one available for the above mentioned session I do not know how long they were available and I dont think Dietzen did either There were only or copies left and I took all of them BEA usually put out many copies in the rack so I dont know how many were actually picked up The hard copies are PowerPoint printouts that include room for notes so the slides are very small making it difficult to read When the slides were shown on the screen during the session they were very clear Also during some of the sessions not the one where AGENCYCOM presented I attended there was some question about the availability of the handouts and someone from BEA would answer something about the web I assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies of the presentations available on the BEA web site I will try to confirm this tomorrow Thursday I checked the web site a few minutes ago and the presentations are not there I will followup with any more details if I remember something else or if there are any further developments Thanks Kevin Montagne Voice Cell Pager

Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online One with the collateral clause and one without and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept based on creditworthiness of the customer Of course this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers we just cant carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the Exempt Futures Market Declaration Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers andor any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power if any Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states EnronOnline prices are firm I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of Invitation to Treat Offer and Acceptance Please note also the related information on the Click for Details link on the homepage The comments in the Mallesons document regarding Enron Responds to the Offer are not strictly correct The customer is essentially only able to select a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only submit a price which is shown on EnronOnline please call me for a more detailed discussion of the price range function if needed Enron can only reject such Offers if the customers credit limit is insufficient or if the price or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the customers offer hits our database The acceptancerejection of a customers offer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous Confirmation Exchanged although we currently issue faxed confirmations please note that under EnronOnline we are not under obligation to do so the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient Does the first PA amendment read correctly also the first ETA amendment GTC amendment Do we need to reference ISDA Is it not possible at some time now or in the future to have a nonISDA master Dave David NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mark CT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT David CT Subject EnronOnline Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline Of immediate concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next week Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments These are in the annexes to the advice Following are my comments Password Agreement Fine seems a good to give address for notices etc ETA I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US The suggested amendment to clause c I believe we could dispense with It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server However from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality GTCs Minor changes The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the collateral clause Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the ETA for inclusion in Road Show I expect to settle the advice early week and will circulate it Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENTon PM Farrell Scott on PM To cc James Martin Subject EnronOnline Mallesons Stephen Jaques Confidential communication David Please find attached a further draft of the advice marked up to show the changes made from the previous draft DOC In particular please note that we have suggested amendments to the agreements in the schedule if these are acceptable for use we will accept the revision mode in the final version If they are not please let us know as certain negative prices are now possible it is expected that an AFMA endorsed amendment to the clause relating to negative prices and market disruption events will be prepared this would need to be included in the GTCs and your ISDAs it would not seem practical to include the collateral language in the GTCs only in respect of some clients as the GTCs are standard provisions Would collateral arrangements in relation to particular clients using GTCs be best documented separately will offers on EnronOnline be considered by a EAF trader in Australia before being accepted the trade practices material can be completed whenever it is convenient for one of our trade practices lawyers to review the working site as a whole Best regards Scott Farrell Senior Associate Mallesons Stephen Jaques Sydney Direct line

changes to the GTC really are required then we will Update the nonAustralian Customer Profiles for Execute Access to Australian Power Note It is highly desireable to avoid making changes to GTCs once they are published and certainly once they have been accepted by a company ie a company which does not already have a signed Master Agreement with Enron as this requires an awkward change notification

CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Arfan CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Alan CT Subject Re Australian Status This will indeed be a St Patricks Day for us to remember in years to come Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies It appears there has been a bit a communication mixup no doubt not helped by me being out of the office So l let me go back to the beginning Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government These require that before entering into a contract with a counterparty the registered facility provider ie Enron Australia Finance must be satisfied on reasonable grounds a about the creditworthiness of the counterparty and b that the counterparty is contracting on its own account This obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the counterparty has an Australian presence or not In the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide counterparties with an Enron Corp guaranty Although this strict legal obligation provision was deleted in July Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist was a procedure to vet potential counterparties We have procedures in place in the Sydney office to do this I understood that this activity would still be done in Sydney ie our list of counterparties the alternative was to develop procedures if it was to done else where On Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a screen based trading system This is a legal requirement Although unlikely they may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties I was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures In short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to counterparties that do not have an Australian presence The major sensitivity is taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being directed outside Australia On reviewing the subject this evening I agree with Chris Catts there does not appear to be an issue But I endorse Heidis comment that now we know that there could be nonresident counterparties a first for us lets close off the tax issue I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT Resources International Corp GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an appropriate clause Heidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris We could hopefully settle the words In the interim I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory David F if you must load GTCs Friday Houston time then I suggest we go with what we have I would ask for one small changeOne small change though Tana picked up one point A new paragraph f should be included as follows f Subparagragh c of the ISDA Master Agreement will not apply to all Transactions Heidi Mason PM To David CT cc Debbie R CT Tana CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Arfan CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Status Dave I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier I spoke with David Minns re the Eligible Persons criteria and he noted that while he had discussed the capitalasset holding criteria with Tana he had not provided to anyone the other criteria and that while these may be covered by the US criteria there will need to be a review of all criteria before we can assess that all are covered I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made there will be no withholding tax issues re the paymentsreceipts I am going to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to review the GTC On the settlement issue in the short term the best way to do the settlements for nonNEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston this is how we settled our one previous cross border transaction as this gives a third party review of the payments prior to release Regards Heidi David CT To Debbie R CT Tana CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Heidi MasonENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mark CT Arfan CT Subject Australian Status As I understand it the current situation with regard to international companies being able to transact on Australian power is this The only remaining potential issue is witholding tax This may or may not be an issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason If it is an issue it is possible that we can borrow some language from the US financial GTC Heidi will coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution if required for incorporation into the Australian GTC An issue was raised with regard to Eligible Persons and the requirement that an Eligible Person hold more than AUS million However Tana Jones has been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the US requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones hence the application of US criteria for Financial trades should be more than sufficient to meet the Australian Eligible Persons requirements Furthermore a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies with an Erating of less than have been approved by credit An issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of AustraClear However as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign companies transacting on Australian power in the near term this should be a problem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not impact the GTC the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles At this point I am anticipating possibly having a witholding tax revision to the GTC which will be uploaded to the system on Friday Houston time If anyone has any questions or concerns please contact me

part of the description and so does not need to be referenced here eg in Uk power ones says fro pm on trade day to pm ont he following day for Day Ahead You need to both then ask unless you already know what products traders want as tokenised and set these up for them They can then start using the new tokenised products the day after they have been set up as the scheduler needs to run overnight to convert the tokenised abbreviation to the correct dates Dale Can you please let Patrice Thurston and Kevin Ruscittit that their product the one I set up as the Balance of Month shoudl be OK to use

concluded that where an Enron nonTokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax Further they have advised that consumption tax Japans VAT should not apply to financial transactions although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the consumption tax Baker McKenzie have advised that they need to do some followup work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our nonJapan trading offices are located I expect to have their response shortly One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax

GTCs for Weather Derivatives In Australia Let me add a couple of observations to Alans explanation There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance PtyLtd as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales an Australian State as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical The only differences currently relate to different data sources There may also be additional changes that come out of the BM review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant However there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products This is the process that is currently followed Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting BM signoff From Alan CT on CDT To Dale CT cc

tonight This does not prohibit us from distributing PAs directly if it is decided that direct distribution is OK However I am keen to answer the following questions as soon as possible so we can establish whether or not the PA can be put back on Does listing a PA for Hong Kong constitute targetting Hong Kong residents Does the Protection of Investors Ordinance apply to EnronOnline or the products contained on EnronOnline What are the HK Securities regulations and what is requried for compliance Is this painful or do we qualify with little effort What happens if we come to the attention of the HK regulator Does it just mean some getting to know you meetings or something more serious Is the Protection of Investors Ordinance aimed at individuals or is it intended to cover companies as well Dave From Mark CT on PM EST To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Amita CT Dale CT David CT Jonathan NRONDEVELOPMENT Justin CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products I concur in Davids analysis Any idea who the target market is in HK If we have specific customers in mind would it be possible to approach them directly rather than making the password application generally available Its not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would still be some targeted HK residents just not the public David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Amita CT David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRON CT Dale CT Justin TimothyENRON NRON CT Mark CT Justin CT Jonathan CT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong It does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we should revisit the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password Application on the EOL registration screen As I raised in my email last week the Hong Kong regulator SFC has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that target Hong Kong residents will be expected to comply with HK securities legislation Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding i securities and ii investment arrangements relating to property other than securities Whilst it is difficult to see how a HK weather swap or any other product listed on EOL would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong residents My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password application for Hong Kong residents The SFC could well take the view that a HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong Again it is the act of making the offer not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the Ordinance Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made l have had an opportunity to review a September advice that Jonathan Marsh obtained from Allen Overy HK In Section they raise similar concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance Way Forward I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be removed from the list on the EOL registration screen at least for the present The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC needs to be recognised This possibility exists irrespective of the decision to list HK weather products Clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in HK of EOL generated by the launch of HK weather may be the catalyst that attracts SFC interest Whilst our legal analysis has not identified any breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an SFC instigated dialogue on this point This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password application If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the public ie where no password is needed provisions that are unambiguously directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC first I note Allen Overy also raised this as a possibility I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas But the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present Amita CT AM To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Dale CT Jennifer

CT Daniel CT Leonardo nron Kal CT cc Paul nron Subject CFTC Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter Forwarded by Rahil JafryHOUECT on PM CFTC Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter ContractsUS Commodity Futures Trading CommissionBrief Article The Oil Daily ITEM Copyright Gale Group All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Energy Intelligence Group CFTC Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter Contracts A long process designed to clarify rules for overthe counter OTC markets may be drawing to a close after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC the main regulatory agency issued its final framework for a new regime The rules are designed to clear up the legal status of OTC products such as swaps while providing more flexible oversight of futures markets and promoting the establishment of independent clearinghouses Unveiled late last month the CFTC reforms are due to be published in the Federal Register next week and would take effect days later in midFebruary In the meantime a new president should take office Jan CFTC experts seem confident that the reforms will survive the changeover saying it is hard for an incoming administration to pull back final regulations There are also signs of progress on a parallel bill supporting the reforms the Commodity Futures Modernization Act This was passed by the House in late October but got bogged down in the Senate partly due to objections by Sen Phil Gramm RTexas who heads the Senate Banking Committee A compromise was hammered out early this week sources say and the law could still get through this year most likely as an attachment to an appropriations bill Legislation would give the CFTC measures a stronger legal footing but could require them to be tweaked into line The CFTC reforms respond to the explosion of both derivatives markets and electronic trading from equities to natural gas Currently electronic exchanges targeting derivatives markets such as the Big Oilbacked IntercontinentalExchange operate in a regulatory gray area The new reforms define futures exchanges more flexibly replacing a onesizefitsall approach with core principles and establishing three tiers of regulation The top tier of recognized futures exchanges RFEs matches the current futures markets such as Nymex and is the most tightly regulated The second rank of derivatives transaction facilities DTFs comprises institutions requiring looser regulation if for example participation is restricted to big companies The third tier of exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities Exempt MTEFs escapes most regulation In parallel the CFTC has clarified an old ruling removing swaps from regulation the socalled Part exemption This ends previous restrictions so that OTC products traded between two parties can now be fungible standardized and cleared This is part of a drive to turn derivatives into legally recognized products making it hard for one side to renege on an unfavorable contract Finally the CFTC has moved to encourage the establishment of independent clearinghouses by separating the rules for exchange and clearing functions Two startups EnergyClear and NexClear have already declared their intention to offer such services starting with US gas and power Amid concerns about price manipulation the energy industry has been treated as a special case throughout the new framework and does not qualify for the leastregulated Exempt MTEF category of exchange The CFTC reforms also remain fuzzy in certain areas In particular the new Part exemption for derivatives covers bilateral transactions with multilateral activity still in something of a gray area Basically an exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for official status as a commercial DTF if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing However a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued The new framework offers legal certainty for those who want recognition it is not ruling on the status of those who dont one expert said In practice outfits such as EnronOnline the web system for direct transactions with Enron are in the clear as bilateral platforms dealing in contracts outside CFTC jurisdiction Intercontinental as a multilateral exchange dealing in standardized swaps could probably remain unregulated but could also register as a DTF to clarify its status Nymex in its current form would be an RFE because it entertains noninstitutional traders But the exchange could apply for its planned electronic arm enymex or its traditional floor to become a DTF by limiting activity to institutional users David Pike Manimoli Dinesh For more on this story see the next issue of Oil

concluded that where an Enron nonTokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax Further they have advised that consumption tax Japans VAT should not apply to financial transactions although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the

for Weather Derivatives In Australia Let me add a couple of observations to Alans explanation There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance PtyLtd as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales an Australian State as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical The only differences currently relate to different data sources There may also be additional changes that come out of the BM review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant However there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products This is the process that is currently followed Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting BM signoff From Alan CT on CDT To Dale CT cc

for Weather Derivatives In Australia Let me add a couple of observations to Alans explanation There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance PtyLtd as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales an Australian State as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical The only differences currently relate to different data sources There may also be additional changes that come out of the BM review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant However there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products This is the process that is currently followed Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting BM signoff From Alan CT on CDT To Dale CT cc

make the Agency presentation covering EnronOnline available on their website KevinJay Can you please try to identify the appropriate BEA contact as a matter of priority this morning RichardMark Please advise as to how strong we can be in warning BEA not to publish the information on their website Thanks Dave From Kevin Montagne AM To Richard B CT David CT Jay CT Philippe A CT Mark CT Louise CT cc Subject AGENCYCOM Presentation at BEA Users Conference Here is the information regarding the presentation done by AGENCYCOM The BEA Users Conference is being held in San Francisco CA The conference has over registered users representing many types of companies About the Session and Presentation On Wednesday February at an hour long session was to open to any registered conference attendee Around very rough guess people attended the session The session was moderated by Scott Dietzen CTO BEA Server Division and was described as Web ECommerce Solutions Using Best of Breed Technologies The session included panel members from Calico Commerce an ISV Idea Integration an integrator Cygent an ISV and AGENCYCOM Each of the panel members gave a minute presentation then the session was turned over for general questions and answers Joe Tatem of AGENCYCOM went last and spoke about the web development marketplace where it was and where it needed to head Like the other panel members he described his company and gave a little sales pitch for BEA Weblogic Tatem then presented a case study as an example of some of their work This example was of AGENCYCOMs work for Enron on EnronOnline His case study consisted of slides The first slide had screen images of EnronOnline one was the EnronOnline home page and the second was the quotes page populated with some products The quotes page was overlayed on the home page and obscured the EnronOnline banner on the bottom so that only the ne at the end showed The Enron logo the counterclockwise degree logo was clearly visible He talked about it being a Trading Extranet site but said he could not name the customer He described that real time prices for products were being displayed to customers He then showed the next slide which gave a high level overview of the application architecture for EnronOnline This slide contains details about real time server RTServer and its associated application server including the RMI communication mechanism He made a comment about how they were particularly proud of the real time piece and how it was designed and how it worked This slide also contained a reference to the fact EnronOnline uses Oracle i He also mentioned Jesica as the content management piece and indicated that they were looking at other rd party products to replace that in their future projects This slide also contains a reference to StackManager and he indicated that it was developed by the unamed client and not by AGENCYCOM He also talked about ShockWave plugin being used in the browser to receive the real time quotes Only one question was asked from the audience during his showing of the technical architecture slide This question paraphrased was When you use RMI between the web server and the app server how many connections do you use He replied paraphrased one per thread The questioner then asked something else that I assumed was a technical detail about how WebLogic RMI worked Tatem replied incorrectly and a BEA employee responded with the right answer About the Handouts of the Presentation BEA tried to make available hard copies of all presentation slides in each session They setup a series of shelves that were numbered for each session The documents were available starting Monday during the registration process and throughout the conference On Monday evening I went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which I was interested About a third of the handouts for the sessions were not available I did not notice whether the one for above mentioned presentation was available I did not expect it to one of the more interested ones During some of the sessions BEA handed out copies to those present I did not see any handed out during the above mentioned session After the session was over I called Jay Webb and told him of the above details After telling Jay I saw Scott Dietzen from BEA in the hallway I had met him twice before I told Dietzen that the presentation that AGENCYCOM did in his panel was about Enron We had already discussed the project with Dietzen when he visited our Houston office I told him that AGENCYCOM was not supposed to reveal any information concerning the project At this time I did not know that hard copies of the presentation were available I told Dietzen that if they did become available that the portion about EnronOnline should not be distributed Dietzen said he was not aware of the problem with discussing the project He apologized and said he would not distribute any handouts if he received them Sometime later on Wednesday I went to the rack of presentation handouts and there was one available for the above mentioned session I do not know how long they were available and I dont think Dietzen did either There were only or copies left and I took all of them BEA usually put out many copies in the rack so I dont know how many were actually picked up The hard copies are PowerPoint printouts that include room for notes so the slides are very small making it difficult to read When the slides were shown on the screen during the session they were very clear Also during some of the sessions not the one where AGENCYCOM presented I attended there was some question about the availability of the handouts and someone from BEA would answer something about the web I assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies of the presentations available on the BEA web site I will try to confirm this tomorrow Thursday I checked the web site a few minutes ago and the presentations are not there I will followup with any more details if I remember something else or if there are any further developments Thanks Kevin Montagne Voice Cell Pager

tonight This does not prohibit us from distributing PAs directly if it is decided that direct distribution is OK However I am keen to answer the following questions as soon as possible so we can establish whether or not the PA can be put back on Does listing a PA for Hong Kong constitute targetting Hong Kong residents Does the Protection of Investors Ordinance apply to EnronOnline or the products contained on EnronOnline What are the HK Securities regulations and what is requried for compliance Is this painful or do we qualify with little effort What happens if we come to the attention of the HK regulator Does it just mean some getting to know you meetings or something more serious Is the Protection of Investors Ordinance aimed at individuals or is it intended to cover companies as well Dave From Mark CT on PM EST To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Amita CT Dale CT David CT Jonathan NRONDEVELOPMENT Justin CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products I concur in Davids analysis Any idea who the target market is in HK If we have specific customers in mind would it be possible to approach them directly rather than making the password application generally available Its not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would still be some targeted HK residents just not the public David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Amita CT David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRON CT Dale CT Justin TimothyENRON NRON CT Mark CT Justin CT Jonathan CT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong It does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we should revisit the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password Application on the EOL registration screen As I raised in my email last week the Hong Kong regulator SFC has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that target Hong Kong residents will be expected to comply with HK securities legislation Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding i securities and ii investment arrangements relating to property other than securities Whilst it is difficult to see how a HK weather swap or any other product listed on EOL would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong residents My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password application for Hong Kong residents The SFC could well take the view that a HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong Again it is the act of making the offer not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the Ordinance Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made l have had an opportunity to review a September advice that Jonathan Marsh obtained from Allen Overy HK In Section they raise similar concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance Way Forward I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be removed from the list on the EOL registration screen at least for the present The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC needs to be recognised This possibility exists irrespective of the decision to list HK weather products Clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in HK of EOL generated by the launch of HK weather may be the catalyst that attracts SFC interest Whilst our legal analysis has not identified any breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an SFC instigated dialogue on this point This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password application If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the public ie where no password is needed provisions that are unambiguously directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC first I note Allen Overy also raised this as a possibility I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas But the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present Amita CT AM To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Dale CT Jennifer

Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online One with the collateral clause and one without and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept based on creditworthiness of the customer Of course this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers we just cant carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the Exempt Futures Market Declaration Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers andor any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power if any Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states EnronOnline prices are firm I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of Invitation to Treat Offer and Acceptance Please note also the related information on the Click for Details link on the homepage The comments in the Mallesons document regarding Enron Responds to the Offer are not strictly correct The customer is essentially only able to select a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only submit a price which is shown on EnronOnline please call me for a more detailed discussion of the price range function if needed Enron can only reject such Offers if the customers credit limit is insufficient or if the price or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the customers offer hits our database The acceptancerejection of a customers offer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous Confirmation Exchanged although we currently issue faxed confirmations please note that under EnronOnline we are not under obligation to

is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline Of immediate concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next week Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments These are in the annexes to the advice Following are my comments Password Agreement Fine seems a good to give address for notices etc ETA I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US The suggested amendment to clause c I believe we could dispense with It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server However from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality GTCs Minor changes The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the collateral clause Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the ETA for inclusion in Road Show I expect to settle the advice early week and will circulate it Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENTon PM Farrell Scott on PM To cc James Martin Subject EnronOnline Mallesons Stephen Jaques Confidential communication David Please find attached a further draft of the advice marked up to show the changes made from the previous draft DOC In particular please note that we have suggested amendments to the agreements in the schedule if these are acceptable for use we will accept the revision mode in the final version If they are not please let us know as certain negative prices are now possible it is expected that an AFMA endorsed amendment to the clause relating to negative prices and market disruption events will be prepared this would need to be included in the GTCs and your ISDAs it would not seem practical to include the collateral language in the GTCs only in respect of some clients as the GTCs are standard provisions Would collateral arrangements in relation to particular clients using GTCs be best documented separately will offers on EnronOnline be considered by a EAF trader in Australia before being accepted the trade practices material can be

Regulation of OvertheCounter ContractsUS Commodity Futures Trading CommissionBrief Article The Oil Daily ITEM Copyright Gale Group All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Energy Intelligence Group CFTC Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter Contracts A long process designed to clarify rules for overthe counter OTC markets may be drawing to a close after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC the main regulatory agency issued its final framework for a new regime The rules are designed to clear up the legal status of OTC products such as swaps while providing more flexible oversight of futures markets and promoting the establishment of independent clearinghouses Unveiled late last month the CFTC reforms are due to be published in the Federal Register next week and would take effect days later in midFebruary In the meantime a new president should take office Jan CFTC experts seem confident that the reforms will survive the changeover saying it is hard for an incoming administration to pull back final regulations There are also signs of progress on a parallel bill supporting the reforms the Commodity Futures Modernization Act This was passed by the House in late October but got bogged down in the Senate partly due to objections by Sen Phil Gramm RTexas who heads the Senate Banking Committee A compromise was hammered out early this week sources say and the law could still get through this year most likely as an attachment to an appropriations bill Legislation would give the CFTC measures a stronger legal footing but could require them to be tweaked into line The CFTC reforms respond to the explosion of both derivatives markets and electronic trading from equities to natural gas Currently electronic exchanges targeting derivatives markets such as the Big Oilbacked IntercontinentalExchange operate in a regulatory gray area The new reforms define futures exchanges more flexibly replacing a onesizefitsall approach with core principles and establishing three tiers of regulation The top tier of recognized futures exchanges RFEs matches the current futures markets such as Nymex and is the most tightly regulated The second rank of derivatives transaction facilities DTFs comprises institutions requiring looser regulation if for example participation is restricted to big companies The third tier of exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities Exempt MTEFs escapes most regulation In parallel the CFTC has clarified an old ruling removing swaps from regulation the socalled Part exemption This ends previous restrictions so that OTC products traded between two parties can now be fungible standardized and cleared This is part of a drive to turn derivatives into legally recognized products making it hard for one side to renege on an unfavorable contract Finally the CFTC has moved to encourage the establishment of independent clearinghouses by separating the rules for exchange and clearing functions Two startups EnergyClear and NexClear have already declared their intention to offer such services starting with US gas and power Amid concerns about price manipulation the energy industry has been treated as a special case throughout the new framework and does not qualify for the leastregulated Exempt MTEF category of exchange The CFTC reforms also remain fuzzy in certain areas In particular the new Part exemption for derivatives covers bilateral transactions with multilateral activity still in something of a gray area Basically an exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for official status as a commercial DTF if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing However a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued The new framework offers legal certainty for those who want recognition it is not ruling on the status of those who dont one expert said In practice outfits such as EnronOnline the web system for direct transactions with Enron are in the clear as bilateral platforms dealing in contracts outside CFTC jurisdiction Intercontinental as a multilateral exchange dealing in standardized swaps could probably remain unregulated but could also register as a DTF to clarify its status Nymex in its current form would be an RFE because it entertains noninstitutional traders But the exchange could apply for its planned electronic arm enymex or its traditional floor to become a DTF by limiting activity to institutional users David Pike Manimoli Dinesh For more on this story see the next issue of Oil

CT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark CT Arfan CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Alan CT Subject Re Australian Status This will indeed be a St Patricks Day for us to remember in years to come Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies It appears there has been a bit a communication mixup no doubt not helped by me being out of the office So l let me go back to the beginning Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government These require that before entering into a contract with a counterparty the registered facility provider ie Enron Australia Finance must be satisfied on reasonable grounds a about the creditworthiness of the counterparty and b that the counterparty is contracting on its own account This obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the counterparty has an Australian presence or not In the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide counterparties with an Enron Corp guaranty Although this strict legal obligation provision was deleted in July Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist was a procedure to vet potential counterparties We have procedures in place in the Sydney office to do this I understood that this activity would still be done in Sydney ie our list of counterparties the alternative was to develop procedures if it was to done else where On Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a screen based trading system This is a legal requirement Although unlikely they may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties I was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures In short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to counterparties that do not have an Australian presence The major sensitivity is taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being directed outside Australia On reviewing the subject this evening I agree with Chris Catts there does not appear to be an issue But I endorse Heidis comment that now we know that there could be nonresident counterparties a first for us lets close off the tax issue I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT Resources International Corp GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an appropriate clause Heidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris We could hopefully settle the words In the interim I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory David F if you must load GTCs Friday Houston time then I suggest we go with what we have I would ask for one small changeOne small change though Tana picked up one point A new paragraph f should be included as follows f Subparagragh c of the ISDA Master Agreement will not apply to all Transactions Heidi

I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier I spoke with David Minns re the Eligible Persons criteria and he noted that while he had discussed the capitalasset holding criteria with Tana he had not provided to anyone the other criteria and that while these may be covered by the US criteria there will need to be a review of all criteria before we can assess that all are covered I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made there will be no withholding tax issues re the paymentsreceipts I am going to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to review the GTC On the settlement issue in the short term the best way to do the settlements for nonNEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston this is how we settled our one previous cross border transaction as this gives a third party review of the payments prior to release

I understand it the current situation with regard to international companies being able to transact on Australian power is this The only remaining potential issue is witholding tax This may or may not be an issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason If it is an issue it is possible that we can borrow some language from the US financial GTC Heidi will coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution if required for incorporation into the Australian GTC An issue was raised with regard to Eligible Persons and the requirement that an Eligible Person hold more than AUS million However Tana Jones has been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the US requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones hence the application of US criteria for Financial trades should be more than sufficient to meet the Australian Eligible Persons requirements Furthermore a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies with an Erating of less than have been approved by credit An issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of AustraClear However as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign companies transacting on Australian power in the near term this should be a problem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not impact the GTC the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles At this point I am anticipating possibly having a witholding tax revision to the GTC which will be uploaded to the system on Friday Houston time If anyone has any questions or concerns please contact me

know what products traders want as tokenised and set these up for them They can then start using the new tokenised products the day after they have been set up as the scheduler needs to run overnight to convert the tokenised abbreviation to the correct dates Dale Can you please let Patrice Thurston and Kevin Ruscittit that their product the one I set up as the Balance of Month shoudl be OK to use

concluded that where an Enron nonTokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax Further they have advised that consumption tax Japans VAT should not apply to financial transactions although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the consumption tax Baker McKenzie have advised that they need to do some followup work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our nonJapan trading offices are located I expect to have their response shortly One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron trading offices In this case it may be appropriate for Enron Japan to receive a service fee for such

The benefit of your experience is invaluable in assisting us to develop our forms I had a couple of reservations about some changes you proposed In particular the changes to the Swap product description would involve the Fixed and Floating Price in each Calculation Period half hour being averaged over a Settlement or Determination Period The payment obligation would then be multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period to get the amount payable on the Settlement Date This not the way electricity derivatives are traded on the Australian electricity pool In addition to being inconsistent with the terminology both within our documentation and industry agreed forms we would have difficulty in having this new trading form adopted by the market In brief in Australia electricity trades occur in the following manner Trades are calculated on the basis of discrete half hourly Calculation Periods Payment obligations for these Calculation Periods are then aggregated on Settlement Date each month The Settlement Date is defined as the day each month when parties are obliged to make payments under the National Electricity Code It is the market custom for the Notional Quantity to be quoted in MWs This number is then divided in half to calculate to convert it into MWhs which becomes the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period To ensure its consistency with market practice we have determined that amounts should be quoted in MWs then converted in this manner into MWhs This is explained in the product description Mark Taylor and myself discussed the principles that should be followed in preparing long form product descriptions Whilst we should endeavour for consistency in drafting and in terminology amongst products the primary concern is to ensure that the terms used in the long form descriptions are consistent with our GTCs other relevant contractual arrangements with the counterparties and market trading forms There are also practical reasons for adopting terminology used in a particular market We would have some difficulty in attempting to market EnronOnline to potential counterparties if we also simultaneously convince them to commence trading on another type of product Furthermore departure from agreed forms of trading will increase the transaction risk I would be interested in getting your views as we are planning to turn out a number of descriptions over the next week based on our original form Forwarded by David MinnsENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Paul Smith PM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Allan FordENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have changed the description of the reference load shape for OffPeak and Flat trades Can you pls OK these before I proceed with other regions In the meantime I will use the original Peak template as the base for options Rgds Paul David Minns To Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Australian Power EOL Long Form Description The major change is the adoption of a new product into Australia The current arrangement is for trades to be effected in discrete minute Calculation Periods settled monthly in accordance with an the NEMMCO calendar What is proposed is for the floating amounts to to be averaged over a Settlement Period The implication is that the Average Floating Amount is this the Average Floating Price multiplied by the number of Calculation Periods This should equate to the same figure There are a couple of concerns This is not what is currently traded There are no definitions to cover these terms We would also have to amend the GTCs and existing ISDA Agreements to be able to trade this type of Product Apart from additional definitions issues such as rounding conventions for averaging would also need to be addressed We will need to educate potential counterparties as to this produce There is also a change to require counterparties to quote a volume per Settlement Period A figure is quoted in MW and then multiplied by the number of hours within the Settlement Period to get the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period Assuming this is limited to the number of hours within each Victorian NEM Peak during the Settlement Period it should work But there will need to be an explanation that the Average Floating Amount is the Average Floating Price multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period If we must adopt this form then we have no choice but I believe that it will cause difficulties in implementing EnronOnline We will need not only sell the system but also new products A further level of complexity will be added to trades as we attempt modify the current Australian market conventions Paul Smith AM To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David Here is the response from Mark Comments Rgds Paul Forwarded by Paul SmithENRONDEVELOPMENT on Mark CT To David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Australian Power EOL Long Form Description David I have reviewed the language sent by Paul The description is broken down into paragraphs for the record Paragraphs all cover details usually covered in the Product Type description is actually settlement dates for which we do not have a separate attribute Paragraph is reference period Paragraph is Index Paragraph is loadshape These look fine to me subject to my observations on whether we can use the Averaging language Paragraph covers attributes currency looks fine and Unit of Measure for which I suggest we go with our current language for MWh which details that the volume submitted by the counterparty is MWh per hour The product type language does not refer to determination or settlement periods but calculation periods half hourly and then details the computation of volume for a calculation period If we are consistent with the approach used in other products we would refere to the average reference price being the index within a determination period and further define the determination period If we average this also changes the loadshape language I have attached a document with the language I would propose referring to averaging Paul I have reviewed the descriptions comparative to those already held for power financial swaps on the system David may have further comments David is not back until th Feb and you may wish to have your legal team consider if the averaging language can be used in Australia before he returns If it can not I suggest we could add the definition of determination period and state that the settlement amount is the aggregation of the amounts computed for all calculation periods within the determination period The second attachment purely takes the language from your document and orders it as it would appear assuming all the attribute descriptions are as per my breakdown above regards M Paul NRONDEVELOPMENT To David CT cc Mark CT Allan FordENRON
