ASAP So the value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a policy will quickly evaporate if we take weeks to study what the policy should say Second I have a unique situation Our concept of is really unlike the rest of Enrons today What happens today is that network engineers unilaterally make decisions about deployment configuration and other matters which effect the longs and shorts of our assetcontract portfolio that they view strictly from a network operating standpoint A good example was a decision to move our primary TeraPop three large servers storing gigabytes each from Portland to LA The servers are already in place and purchased so no capital was involved But the decision has huge ramifications on the future LANew York and other Bandwidth usage and that cost money Now it could be that the LANew York cost is cheaper than the PortlandNew York cost the whole point is no one knows What our valueatrisk policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions and put them into the hands of the risk management group where the decision will be made with at least some economic work behind it I really see the EBS policy to be misnamed since we dont really have the math done to calc It really is a volumetricbased control policy that says you cant make network changes over XX amount of Megabytes a storage measure or OC equivalents a bandwidth measure without Risk Management making or approving the decision I do believe that with Researchs help we can in time actually calculate the impact of such decisions At that time the policy should be modified to set metrics based on the calculations So if you have an open enough mind to let us coop your word for a minute we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into thinking about their decisions as having value effects Said directly Kevin Hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over significant network changes from the field to the trading floor and I am going to issue something NOW to effectuate that So I really want your views on what we are doing but thought you needed some flavor and an sense of the urgency If you can weigh in do so quickly Barry

Barry PearceEnron NRON NRON cc Subject Re EBS VaR Transaction Policy Barry Conceptually I see no reason that a process like this can not be implemented In some way we have attempted to do so through

inhouse Kinkos We have taken the first step and done poorly on followup steps to create a very easy to follow process for anything other than direct funded capital However some process around a greater number of assetsdeals is better than none I agree that I have not seen a really good fully baked one implemented but I think it is wrong not to try The only concerns I have is that given that

Subject EBS VaR Transaction Policy Hey you guys We are trying to implement a VaR transaction policy and would like your opinion This is going to be tough because Im not sure we have implemented a similiar policy across any of our other books that is we looking to bring in all the accrualoperational assets as well as the MTM stuff lambdas To have a reallive configuration of the system If assetsroutesservers etcare added what is the impact on the value of the system and what its worth John has attached a draft below for your review and thoughts I can see how this works in a trading environment when you actually know the VaR of your whole trading portfolio However Ive not seen this done with a mixture of MTM accrual assets Add the spice of a operational system valuation and this will be tough to quantify and model Step configure system and value it Step calculate a VaR on this We will need to do some work here Step calculate the incremental VaR of new dealsamendementsreconfigs etc tough See what you think B John Echols PM To Jim FallonEnron nron Communications Barry PearceEnron nron Communications Lou CasariEnron nron Communications cc Subject Policies Here is a first rough draft of a value risk transaction policy I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get some early thinking going on limits for the For example should we effectively shut down all server relocations without approval or allow some level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured I need some commercial and industry realism for this We may need Rick Paiste or your industry helpers Marquardt etc to help us Barry Lou I need your input
