YCC is the owner of a megawatt cogeneration facility Facility in Yuba City California YCC sells its megawatts to Pacific Gas and Electric Co PGE an entity that recently filed for bankruptcy protection YCC recently entered into a fiveyear fixedprice electricity agreement with PGE and YCC desires to enter into a longterm Natural Gas Supply Agreement NGSA with an appropriate supplier Seller of natural gas The NGSA shall be subject to approval of the YCC project lenders and YCC will only be able to enter into the NGSA after bankruptcy court approval of the fiveyear fixedprice electricity agreement with PGE As a result YCC will require a daily update to proposals it receives to account for varying market conditions until it receives all necessary approvals to enter into a final NGSA Term The term sheet contemplates either a threeyear natural gas supply agreement or a fiveyear natural gas supply agreement Under either term the starting date will be tentatively August subject to the necessary approvals Points of Delivery PGE City Gate Annual Volumes For the purposes of this RFP it is assumed that the Facility will consume monthly and annual gas volumes under one of three different operating scenarios Scenario Annual Volume mmBtu The typical historical daily usage at the Facility has been mmBtuday except periods of maintenance or reduction by the Facility due to the satisfaction of capacity requirements under its power purchase agreement PPA with PGE and the typical monthly historical usage has been based upon a Monday through Friday operation Scenario is indicative of plant operations for the satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the PPA essentially YCC would prefer a NGSA that is based upon annual volumes in a rolling month period Monthly Balancing Monthly balancing on the PGE system shall be the Sellers responsibility subject to the limitations of the YCCs natural gas transportation agreement with PGE and subject to the PGE gas system rules and tariffs Seller shall be responsible for any gas imbalance charges incurred on the PGE System Usage Estimates For the purpose of assisting Seller in the Nomination process YCC shall make usage estimates in advance and as usage occurs Seller should specify requested frequency of usage estimates Monthly TrueUp Actual usage at the Facility will almost certainly be of some variance to the forecasted monthly gas volumes Seller shall propose a means of trueing up the actual usage to the forecasted monthly volumes The ideal system of trueing up would allow for flexibility to both YCC and Seller the Parties under the following minimum circumstances Trueup of variance between forecasted usage and actual if any If gas price volatility has created daily or other market pricing that creates financial incentive to the Parties to curtail deliveries to the Facility and remarket the natural gas to the spot or other market Allowance for the Facility to curtail deliveries for planned or unplanned maintenance Monthly trueup may incorporate resolution of the differences between price and volume Day of Nomination The date of Nomination of daily gas volumes by the Seller to the PGE City Gate shall be at the option of and as determined by Seller subject to the limitations of YCCs natural gas transportation agreement with PGE and subject to the PGE gas system rules and tariffs Maximum Daily Nomination Quantity YCCs natural gas transportation agreement with PGE allows for a maximum daily nomination quantity of MMbtuDay Price YCC seeks a NGSA that will provide a physical price hedge via three alternative strategies The strategies are as follows Strategy Price Hedge Fixed price for the term Floating price with a nottoexceed cap Floating price with a minimum and maximum price YCC acknowledges that other hedging strategies exist and may be advisable for the NGSA The Seller is encouraged to supply a proposal that incorporates other strategies Credit and Payment Terms YCC can offer the following credit and payment mechanisms for the purpose of removing credit and payment concern from the Seller SemiMonthly Payment SemiMonthly payment for gas based on expected consumption over the first fifteen calendarday period of each month and the expected consumption over the balance of each month via a wire from YCC to be made one day following the receipt of payments for electrical energy from PGE Priority payment YCC has an agreement with its lender that costs of fuel shall have first priority in the waterfall of cash flows ie the fuel supplier shall be paid from project cash flows prior to the payment of all other costs incurred including repayment of debt operations and maintenance costs management fees etc RFP Response may be sent via fax to Paul Cummins
