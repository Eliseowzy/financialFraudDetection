<1671592.1075859532280.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dan.lyons@enron.com,2000-12-07 05:40:00,MPLP Capacity Chargesis the email I told you aboutIll forward you a voice mail he left me on this subject and have him get in touch with you directly to get you a copy of the PPA and discuss the issue Forwarded by Dan LyonsHOUECT on PM Garrick Hill AM To Dan CT cc Douglas NRON Charles NRON Dan CT Mike nron John CT Subject MPLP Capacity Charges THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL Per the voicemail I left you yesterday concerning the billing of capacity charges by Consumers for electric service provided by MPLP Background MPLP went into service on October and provides service under a PPA for a term that ends September Capacity charges are billed under Section a of the PPA which references a schedule of capacity rates provided as Exhibit D Exhibit D shows Consumers avoided cost rates for years and converts these rates into the specific rates applied under Section a Presumably any QF that signed a contract with Consumers for a facility due to go on line in would be subject to payment under the same avoided cost rate schedule although the way these rates were manipulated to achieve any particular agreement might vary from project to project ie in the case of MPLP the rates are backloaded over ten years before levelizing for the remaining term of the PPA Consumers which selfbills under the PPA began applying Year capacity rates under Exhibit D on January and implemented subsequent increases on January of and January rate increases were not anticipated by the partnership However there is no definition for contract year under the PPA and Exhibit D shows rates by Year without specific reference to what constitutes a Year ie contract year vs calendar year Based on Consumers past actions it would appear that their interpretation of the PPA has been that Schedule D sets rates that are effective in a particular calendar year NOTE FROM A RATE GEEK This would generally jive with the manner in which the avoided cost rates are determined and scheduled That is its unlikely that Consumers ran a new avoided cost study each time it entered into a contract with a QF Rather one could interpret Column b of Exhibit D to lay out the avoided cost rates in effect in calendar year etc Further to this interpretation Section a also lays out the manner

him get in touch with you directly to get you a copy of the PPA and discuss the issue Forwarded by Dan LyonsHOUECT on PM Garrick Hill AM To Dan CT cc Douglas NRON Charles NRON Dan CT Mike nron John CT Subject MPLP Capacity Charges THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL Per the voicemail I left you yesterday concerning the billing of capacity charges by Consumers for electric service provided by MPLP Background MPLP went into service on October and provides service under a PPA for a term that ends September Capacity charges are billed under Section a of the PPA which references a schedule of capacity rates provided as Exhibit D Exhibit D shows Consumers avoided cost rates for years and converts these rates into the specific rates applied under Section a Presumably any QF that signed a contract with Consumers for a facility due to go on line in would be subject to payment under the same avoided cost rate schedule although the way these rates were manipulated to achieve any particular agreement might vary from project to project ie in the case of MPLP the rates are backloaded over ten years before levelizing for the remaining term of the PPA Consumers which selfbills under the PPA began applying Year capacity rates under Exhibit D on January and implemented subsequent increases on January of and January rate increases were not anticipated by the partnership However there is no definition for contract year under the PPA and Exhibit D shows rates by Year without specific reference to what constitutes a Year ie contract year vs calendar year Based on Consumers past actions it would appear that their interpretation of the PPA has been that Schedule D sets rates that are effective in a particular calendar year NOTE FROM A RATE GEEK This would generally jive with the manner in which the avoided cost rates are determined and scheduled That is its unlikely that Consumers ran a new avoided cost study each time it entered into a contract with a QF Rather one could interpret Column b of Exhibit D to lay out the avoided cost rates in effect in calendar year etc Further to this interpretation Section a also lays out the manner in which total capacity charges are adjusted if for any calendar year beginning with the second calendar year after the calendar year during which the Commercial Operation Date occurs the project fails to achieve a Contract Capacity Factor which is determined based on results for any calendar year Based on Consumers action and this language the partnership remained silent on the interpretation

Christopher nron Dan CT Subject Steve Ticks Restructuring Proposal Steve Ticks PPA restructuring proposal which we now refer to as the ten points of light is generally as follows The partnership agrees to amend the interest rate adjustment to capacity charges which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of a lower kWmo charge Per Steve the modified adjustment should take into account plant capacity use of the term vs construction loan amount and a vs coverage ratio Steve also advocates that the loan balance be reduced for the development fee collected by Tenaska at close I wouldnt go there as Steve has told me on a number of occasions that Brazos doesnt know about this fee The partnership agrees to change how the capacity rate is applied he advocates charging the new capacity rate on MW and charging of the new capacity rate on the next MW which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of fewer billing determinants Steves view is that items and need to amount to at least MM in savings to Brazos per year more is better MM is a slam dunk The effects of items and are mitigated by a collecting a higher capacity rate for some period of time after and adjusting energy rates through to recapture marginal energy losses Steves advice on these point is that we shouldnt be pigs As I think you know our exposure on point b is greatest when the plant runs at higher levels of capacity which causes us to consume more than Dthday without adequate compensation through the PPA Brazos purchases the development site for x he likes to use MM which I think is a stretch Steve understands that we have a MM termination payment obligation back to the original Tenaska IV partners to the extent we wish to convey the development assets but believes Tenaska Inc would be willing to assume all or a portion of this commitment in exchange for an agreement wBrazos that totally eliminates its officers liability on fraud Steve appears to believe this risk is real or he wouldnt make such a big deal out of it He points to the use of the coverage assumption in the interest rate adjustment as clear evidence that Brazos made decisions based on an assumption that the Tenaska partners would earn only a reasonable riskadjusted return on this project Even Merrill Lynch Brazos financial advisor bought off on this provision of the agreement Steve is willing to go to bat with both Brazos and Tenaska on this point to see this to resolution To the extent hes successful and we receive for example MM for the development assets this would be an immediate offset to the capacity payment reductions set out under items and The partnership converts the facility to EWG and per Steve shares the benefits with Brazos My view is that this could just as easily be done by adjusting the heat rates used for tolling purposes ie after and to the extent applied in the energy pricing used to address his item through The partnership removes distilled water equipment and sells it in the market Steve thinks proceeds realized from the sale should be a shared up to with Brazos or b used to purchase replacement blades that could be installed during the May outage to prevent summer downtime obviously timing is a key issue here Brazos is granted the right to further reduce its contract payment obligations in ways that are similar to its Apache demand charge buyout This is a Steve Tick soapbox item he uses it as an opportunity to remind Brazos that other value has been created during the facilitation process Steve speaks to projectlevel debt restructuring and suggests that Brazos be granted the right to affect this restructuring within parameters that are set by the partnership I dont know what to do with this but to say that I believe there is value to restructuring debt at the projectlevel with existing lenders in a way that leaves existing swaps in place Inasmuch as we have always planned to take on structurally subordinated debt obligations there is borrowing capacity at the project level Since we would need to go to the banks for consents on any of the PPAstructural changes advocated by Steve it would appear to make sense to tackle debt restructuring on the same pass The banks would love a solution that puts the disputes to rest and should be willing to both consent and lend against the cash flow of the restructured project CoBank who has MM of the project debt which amortizes beginning in is one of the banks in the total return swap with KBC by virtue of syndication Steve also advocates what he refers to as equitable adjustments In effect he would establish a market index against which the allin PPA price could be compared and would have Brazos pay a premium over its PPA price to the extent the market price floats above the PPA price I think this is an interesting concept but we cant count on value here More importantly Im not aware of a transparent enough price to make this work in ERCOT Finally Steve advocates turning management of the project over to Brazos in return for a hell or high water commitment on capacity payments Steves view is that the hell or high water commitment together with the settlement itself makes PPEs partnership interests more marketable Im not sure we agree with his view of the risks relative to the overall liquidity of our interests However we need to recognize that hes working with substantially more information than we are at this point from the perspective of what he knows about Brazos side of the case My reaction is that there are things we can work with in Steves proposal Chris and I are looking at the pricingcost offset details more closely and should have something to discuss shortly Dan sorry I missed you yesterday Let me know when youd like to place the call to Tom Moore to update him on the current activity Also do you have a sense yet for who well be working with on this internally Happy Trails Rick

Christopher nron Dan CT Subject Steve Ticks Restructuring Proposal Steve Ticks PPA restructuring proposal which we now refer to as the ten points of light is generally as follows The partnership agrees to amend the interest rate adjustment to capacity charges which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of a lower kWmo charge Per Steve the modified adjustment should take into account plant capacity use of the term vs construction loan amount and a vs coverage ratio Steve also advocates that the loan balance be reduced for the development fee collected by Tenaska at close I wouldnt go there as Steve has told me on a number of occasions that Brazos doesnt know about this fee The partnership agrees to change how the capacity rate is applied he advocates charging the new capacity rate on MW and charging of the new capacity rate on the next MW which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of fewer billing determinants Steves view is that items and need to amount to at least MM in savings to Brazos per year more is better MM is a slam dunk The effects of items and are mitigated by a collecting a higher capacity rate for some period of time after and adjusting energy rates through to recapture marginal energy losses Steves advice on these point is that we shouldnt be pigs As I think you know our exposure on point b is greatest when the plant runs at higher levels of capacity which causes us to consume more than Dthday without adequate compensation through the PPA Brazos purchases the development site for x he likes to use MM which I think is a stretch Steve understands that we have a MM termination payment obligation back to the original Tenaska IV partners to the extent we wish to convey the development assets but believes Tenaska Inc would be willing to assume all or a portion of this commitment in exchange for an agreement wBrazos that totally eliminates its officers liability on fraud Steve appears to believe this risk is real or he wouldnt make such a big deal out of it He points to the use of the coverage assumption in the interest rate adjustment as clear evidence that Brazos made decisions based on an assumption that the Tenaska partners would earn only a reasonable riskadjusted return on this project Even Merrill Lynch Brazos financial advisor bought off on this provision of the agreement Steve is willing to go to bat with both Brazos and Tenaska on this point to see this to resolution To the extent hes successful and we receive for example MM for the development assets this would be an immediate offset to the capacity payment reductions set out under items and The partnership converts the facility to EWG and per Steve shares the benefits with Brazos My view is that this could just as easily be done by adjusting the heat rates used for tolling purposes ie after and to the extent applied in the energy pricing used to address his item through The partnership removes distilled water equipment and sells it in the market Steve thinks proceeds realized from the sale should be a shared up to with Brazos or b used to purchase replacement blades that could be installed during the May outage to prevent summer downtime obviously timing is a key issue here Brazos is granted the right to further reduce its contract payment obligations in ways that are similar to its Apache demand charge buyout This is a Steve Tick soapbox item he uses it as an opportunity to remind Brazos that other value has been created during the facilitation process Steve speaks to projectlevel debt restructuring and suggests that Brazos be granted the right to affect this restructuring within parameters that are set by the partnership I dont know what to do with this but to say that I believe there is value to restructuring debt at the projectlevel with existing lenders in a way that leaves existing swaps in place Inasmuch as we have always planned to take on structurally subordinated debt obligations there is borrowing capacity at the project level Since we would need to go to the banks for consents on any of the PPAstructural changes advocated by Steve it would appear to make sense to tackle debt restructuring on the same pass The banks would love a solution that puts the disputes to rest and should be willing to both consent and lend against the cash flow of the restructured project CoBank who has MM of the project debt which amortizes beginning in is one of the banks in the total return swap with KBC by virtue of syndication Steve also advocates what he refers to as equitable adjustments In effect he would establish a market index against which the allin PPA price could be compared and would have Brazos pay a premium over its PPA price to the extent the market price floats above the PPA price I think this is an interesting concept but we cant count on value here More importantly Im not aware of a transparent enough price to make this work in ERCOT Finally Steve advocates turning management of the project over to Brazos in return for a hell or high water commitment on capacity payments Steves view is that the hell or high water commitment together with the settlement itself makes PPEs partnership interests more marketable Im not sure we agree with his view of the risks relative to the overall liquidity of our interests However we need to recognize that hes working with substantially more information than we are at this point from the perspective of what he knows about Brazos side of the case My reaction is that there are things we can work with in Steves proposal Chris and I are looking at the pricingcost offset details more closely and should have something to discuss shortly Dan sorry I missed you yesterday Let me know when youd like to place the call to Tom Moore to update him on the current activity Also do you have a sense yet for who well be working with on this internally Happy Trails Rick

Michael Schofield PM To cc Subject Texas bill re direct wine sales to consumers Just thought you might be interested in this mike Dueling wineshipping measures ferment Legislature and lobbyists By Laylan Copelin AmericanStatesman Staff Monday February In this parched state Texas lawmakers are fond of saying that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting But legislators are busy turning wine into water squabbling over the selling of wine directly to customers whether over the Internet or via tourists shipping wine home to Texas For the second legislative session the states small wineries and the Wine Institute of California are squaring off against the powerful Texas distributors Two years ago the Licensed Beverage Distributors of Texas tried to make it a felony to ship wine across state lines while the California wineries tried to circumvent the four Texas companies that dominate distribution of liquor and wine We fought to a standstill said Austin lobbyist Sharon Hull who represents the Wine Institute of California Now for Round Two Both sides have their flagwaving issues On one side are ecommerce and questions about the right to free trade among states On the other side are warnings that taxes will go uncollected wine will be sold over the Internet to minors and outofstate wineries will be bootlegging if they ship to the states many dry precincts that never approved the sale of alcohol The real issue is money And the fight is between two business models of how to deliver wine to the customer One eliminates the middleman the other honors a delivery system that Texas has used since the end of Prohibition With rare exceptions Texas socalled threetier system kept brewers wholesalers and retailers from joint ownership or ventures It prevented a few companies from dominating the alcoholicbeverage industry from fermentation to final sale The law did not keep a handful of companies from dominating the wholesaling segment of the industry Glazers Distributing Co of Dallas competes statewide with Republic Beverage Co of Houston and Block Distributing of San Antonio Block owns percent of Republic A fourth Longhorn Liquors of Arlington competes in the Dallas area Among them they control all the distribution of distilled spirits and an estimated percent of the wine wholesale market in Texas Thats why some lawmakers want to make changes If the two big wholesale guys dont anoint your wine said state Rep David Swinford RDumas youre toast In addition to major outofstate brands Texas distributors sold threefourths of the million gallons of wine produced in Texas in Yet almost all of that was from the states four biggest wineries Llano Estacado St Genevieve Cap Rock and Fall Creek Socalled boutique wines from California or from small Texas wineries almost never make it to the grocery shelves Current law says Texans cannot bring into the state more than gallons about two cases of wine per month And buyers must accompany the wine instead of shipping it There are similar limits on beer and liquor Also Texas wineries can sell only gallons a year to customers at a winery if it is in a wet precinct that allows the sale of alcohol And they can ship only limited amounts of wine to a customer who lives in a wet precinct Last year a federal judge in Houston said the gallon limit is an unconstitutional restriction on free trade among states The judge has withheld a final ruling probably waiting to see what the Legislature will do Meanwhile a federal appeals ruling in Indiana upholding a states right to regulate alcohol sales has given wholesalers hope that Texas can win on appeal Yet two lawmakers Swinford and Rep Anna Mowery RFort Worth have taken two different tacks to promote wine sales Mowerys House Bill would keep the gallon limit but create a direct wineshippers permit allowing wineries to ship to Texans A person years or older with proper identification would be required to sign for the delivery And the holder of the shippers permit would be required to pay all taxes Wine could not be shipped into a dry precinct Only Texas counties allow the sale of alcohol countywide Eightynine percent of the state is either dry or a patchwork of small precincts where alcohol can be sold Alan Gray director of the Licensed Beverage Distributors opposes the bill He said he believes that minors would be able to buy wine off the Internet that local sales taxes would not be collected and that the shippers have no easy way to determine where alcohol sales are legal We think it creates nothing more than an honor system Gray said Mowery insists that allowing direct shipping of a small amount of wine to customers wont affect wholesalers profits Gray argued that if wine wins an exception liquor could be next The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission which enforces the states laws is not allowed to support or oppose legislation Randy Yarbrough the agencys assistant director said Mowerys bill could provide equal treatment to Texas wholesalers and outofstate wineries Yet the agency would have to work out collection and payment of sales taxes to cities Also there is no easy way such as a database for shippers to determine areas of the state where alcohol can be sold No one at the state level knows where the wet and dry areas are Yarbrough said As for sale to minors Yarbrough said states that allow Internet sales have used minors in sting operations But he believes that sales to minors remain a bigger problem for local retailers Kids generally do not want to buy alcohol over the Internet Yarbrough said They want it for tonight Swinford the Panhandle Republican takes a Texasonly approach House Bill would allow Texas wineries to ship up to two cases of wine per month within the state even into dry areas Wineries in dry counties also could sell wine on the premises just as private clubs do with memberships I call this bill DirectShip Lite joked Swinford Swinford said his bill will develop the Texas wine industry Gray argues that it may be illegal because it would favor Texas wineries over outofstate ones Swinford said Texas wineries need the help California produces times the wine that Texas does but consumes only three times as much This is not a booze bill he said I dont even like wine I like agriculture You may contact Laylan Copelin at or Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at
