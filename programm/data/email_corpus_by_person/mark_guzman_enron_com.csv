December AM To Pergher Gunther Subject CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt FYI if you missed this it is what I was able to find out about the ISO constraining down of PX prices as of late Monday It seems to me like the ISO staff is opposed to the implementing the softcap that Winter got the FERC to approve on an emergency basis CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones

Water System At Risk This article was originally published Monday By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe Bonneville Power Administration which manages the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest US may not have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and spring a spokesman said Monday The way its shaping up now we are very concerned Weve had one of the driest Novembers on record and a very dry December said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion for fish in the river we have some concerns for later on this winter for power and for fish flows this April Hansen said Due to the strains on the system Bonneville has told the California Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are otherwise imminent Thursday Bonneville rushed to Californias rescue only after the ISO declared its firstever Stage emergency and blackouts were avoided Water in the federal systems main storage reservoir Coulee dam is at feet The maximum capacity of the reservoir is feet and the project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to feet Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty the normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of December Grand Coulee storage has fallen feet since Nov during a time when it is normally rising Whats more every gallon of water that rushes through the systems turbines generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than from lower ones so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesnt mean we wont be able to meet our obligations for fish flow But it presents a riskier operation Everytime you draw them down and combine them with cold weather the probability of meeting those flow requirements drops Hansen said Normally Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California utilities during the fall However Californias economic boom has raised electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual importer Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the coming spring snow melt We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this point Hansen said If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their customers demand for electric heating Bonneville will step in to avoid blackouts But each time that happens in the early part of the heating season it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in February or March Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals avoiding floods trying to improve fish populations recreation and power which has the lowest priority except in an electric supply emergency The hydropower operator is pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary obligations On a fivealarm scale We run at about twoandahalf alarm averaged over the year If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says well be in a four andahalf or five real quick Berry said Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and the California Under its federal tariff it cannot ask for more than a megawatthour from the ISO for example though the ISO usually offers MWh But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to MWh Friday in the Northwest and they have been running above MWh for more than a week Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market levels in a couple of months because it is being forced to rescue California so frequently now The difference could mean a hundredsofmilliondollar federal subsidy for California even though Bonnevilles priority obligation is to Northwest utilities according to its federal charter As a result Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under exchange deals whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at some later time Those deals could make the ISOs already strained financial situation worse if power market prices continue to rise through the winter By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMT Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc GMT December DJ Transalta Stops Pwr Sales To CalISO Questions Credit This article was originally published Monday LOS ANGELES Dow JonesTransalta an investorowned utility based in Alberta Canada stopped selling power to the California Independent System Operator at pm PST Monday GMT Tuesday because it fears the grid operator wont be able to pay market sources told Dow Jones Newswires For about eight hours Monday Transalta sold the ISO megawatts of power from its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at a megawatthour the source said The MW will cost the ISO about million The cost of producing electricity at the MW Centralia plant is about MWh company officials said Because the ISO which manages electricity reliability in the state was buying a large quantity of power in the spot market Transalta questioned the ISOs creditworthiness A Transalta spokesperson wasnt immediately available for comment Monday Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date Representatives from the ISO wouldnt comment To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is other power suppliers including British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH subsidiary PowerEx have requested that the ISO secure a letter of credit from one of the states three investorowned utilities before any transactions take place Last week Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison did just that issuing a letter of credit to PowerEx for million Steve Maviglio press secretary to California Gov Gray Davis confirmed with Dow Jones Newswires that he received a telephone call from Transalta saying the company planned to stop selling power to the grid operator Monday evening The ISO has since called a stagetwo power emergency and requested that Pacific Gas Electric Co interrupt about MW of power to large industrial customers who get

December AM To Pergher Gunther Subject CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt FYI if you missed this it is what I was able to find out about the ISO constraining down of PX prices as of late Monday It seems to me like the ISO staff is opposed to the implementing the softcap that Winter got the FERC to approve on an emergency basis CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones

Water System At Risk This article was originally published Monday By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe Bonneville Power Administration which manages the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest US may not have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and spring a spokesman said Monday The way its shaping up now we are very concerned Weve had one of the driest Novembers on record and a very dry December said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion for fish in the river we have some concerns for later on this winter for power and for fish flows this April Hansen said Due to the strains on the system Bonneville has told the California Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are otherwise imminent Thursday Bonneville rushed to Californias rescue only after the ISO declared its firstever Stage emergency and blackouts were avoided Water in the federal systems main storage reservoir Coulee dam is at feet The maximum capacity of the reservoir is feet and the project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to feet Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty the normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of December Grand Coulee storage has fallen feet since Nov during a time when it is normally rising Whats more every gallon of water that rushes through the systems turbines generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than from lower ones so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesnt mean we wont be able to meet our obligations for fish flow But it presents a riskier operation Everytime you draw them down and combine them with cold weather the probability of meeting those flow requirements drops Hansen said Normally Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California utilities during the fall However Californias economic boom has raised electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual importer Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the coming spring snow melt We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this point Hansen said If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their customers demand for electric heating Bonneville will step in to avoid blackouts But each time that happens in the early part of the heating season it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in February or March Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals avoiding floods trying to improve fish populations recreation and power which has the lowest priority except in an electric supply emergency The hydropower operator is pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary obligations On a fivealarm scale We run at about twoandahalf alarm averaged over the year If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says well be in a four andahalf or five real quick Berry said Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and the California Under its federal tariff it cannot ask for more than a megawatthour from the ISO for example though the ISO usually offers MWh But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to MWh Friday in the Northwest and they have been running above MWh for more than a week Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market levels in a couple of months because it is being forced to rescue California so frequently now The difference could mean a hundredsofmilliondollar federal subsidy for California even though Bonnevilles priority obligation is to Northwest utilities according to its federal charter As a result Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under exchange deals whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at some later time Those deals could make the ISOs already strained financial situation worse if power market prices continue to rise through the winter By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMT Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc GMT December DJ Transalta Stops Pwr Sales To CalISO Questions Credit This article was originally published Monday LOS ANGELES Dow JonesTransalta an investorowned utility based in Alberta Canada stopped selling power to the California Independent System Operator at pm PST Monday GMT Tuesday because it fears the grid operator wont be able to pay market sources told Dow Jones Newswires For about eight hours Monday Transalta sold the ISO megawatts of power from its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at a megawatthour the source said The MW will cost the ISO about million The cost of producing electricity at the MW Centralia plant is about MWh company officials said Because the ISO which manages electricity reliability in the state was buying a large quantity of power in the spot market Transalta questioned the ISOs creditworthiness A Transalta spokesperson wasnt immediately available for comment Monday Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date Representatives from the ISO wouldnt comment To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is other power suppliers including British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH subsidiary PowerEx have requested that the ISO secure a letter of credit from one of the states three investorowned utilities before any transactions take place Last week Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison did just that issuing a letter of credit to PowerEx for million Steve Maviglio press secretary to California Gov Gray Davis confirmed with Dow Jones Newswires that he received a telephone call from Transalta saying the company planned to stop selling power to the grid operator Monday evening The ISO has since called a stagetwo power emergency and requested that Pacific Gas Electric Co interrupt about MW of power to large industrial customers who get

Water System At Risk This article was originally published Monday By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe Bonneville Power Administration which manages the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest US may not have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and spring a spokesman said Monday The way its shaping up now we are very concerned Weve had one of the driest Novembers on record and a very dry December said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion for fish in the river we have some concerns for later on this winter for power and for fish flows this April Hansen said Due to the strains on the system Bonneville has told the California Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are otherwise imminent Thursday Bonneville rushed to Californias rescue only after the ISO declared its firstever Stage emergency and blackouts were avoided Water in the federal systems main storage reservoir Coulee dam is at feet The maximum capacity of the reservoir is feet and the project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to feet Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty the normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of December Grand Coulee storage has fallen feet since Nov during a time when it is normally rising Whats more every gallon of water that rushes through the systems turbines generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than from lower ones so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesnt mean we wont be able to meet our obligations for fish flow But it presents a riskier operation Everytime you draw them down and combine them with cold weather the probability of meeting those flow requirements drops Hansen said Normally Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California utilities during the fall However Californias economic boom has raised electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual importer Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the coming spring snow melt We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this point Hansen said If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their customers demand for electric heating Bonneville will step in to avoid blackouts But each time that happens in the early part of the heating season it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in February or March Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals avoiding floods trying to improve fish populations recreation and power which has the lowest priority except in an electric supply emergency The hydropower operator is pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary obligations On a fivealarm scale We run at about twoandahalf alarm averaged over the year If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says well be in a four andahalf or five real quick Berry said Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and the California Under its federal tariff it cannot ask for more than a megawatthour from the ISO for example though the ISO usually offers MWh But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to MWh Friday in the Northwest and they have been running above MWh for more than a week Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market levels in a couple of months because it is being forced to rescue California so frequently now The difference could mean a hundredsofmilliondollar federal subsidy for California even though Bonnevilles priority obligation is to Northwest utilities according to its federal charter As a result Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under exchange deals whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at some later time Those deals could make the ISOs already strained financial situation worse if power market prices continue to rise through the winter By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMT Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc GMT December DJ Transalta Stops Pwr Sales To CalISO Questions Credit This article was originally published Monday LOS ANGELES Dow JonesTransalta an investorowned utility based in Alberta Canada stopped selling power to the California Independent System Operator at pm PST Monday GMT Tuesday because it fears the grid operator wont be able to pay market sources told Dow Jones Newswires For about eight hours Monday Transalta sold the ISO megawatts of power from its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at a megawatthour the source said The MW will cost the ISO about million The cost of producing electricity at the MW Centralia plant is about MWh company officials said Because the ISO which manages electricity reliability in the state was buying a large quantity of power in the spot market Transalta questioned the ISOs creditworthiness A Transalta spokesperson wasnt immediately available for comment Monday Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date Representatives from the ISO wouldnt comment To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is other power suppliers including British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH subsidiary PowerEx have requested that the ISO secure a letter of credit from one of the states three investorowned utilities before any transactions take place Last week Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison did just that issuing a letter of credit to PowerEx for million Steve Maviglio press secretary to California Gov Gray Davis confirmed with Dow Jones Newswires that he received a telephone call from Transalta saying the company planned to stop selling power to the grid operator Monday evening The ISO has since called a stagetwo power emergency and requested that Pacific Gas Electric Co interrupt about MW of power to large industrial customers who get

December AM To Pergher Gunther Subject CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt FYI if you missed this it is what I was able to find out about the ISO constraining down of PX prices as of late Monday It seems to me like the ISO staff is opposed to the implementing the softcap that Winter got the FERC to approve on an emergency basis CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower
