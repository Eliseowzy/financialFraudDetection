<25968991.1075845715904.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,carlos.sole@enron.com,2001-05-14 07:09:00,Westinghouse Insurance Issueswtg to hear from Andy in terms of whom else to distribute to Forwarded by Carlos SoleNAEnron on PM Thomas Hetherington PM To cc Subject Westinghouse Insurance Issues I have reviewed the insurance policy and selected correspondence relating to the wet turbine issue with Westinghouse Westinghouse has provided estimates to repair the wet turbine for approximately million and to replace it for approximately million The adjusters for the insurance company have advised in correspondence dated April that their investigation is ongoing and that Enron should conduct itself as a prudent uninsured pending a complete investigation of the claim The adjusters have also stated that Underwriters liability will be limited to the reasonable costs of repairs directly caused by the contact of the turbine unit with sea water The adjusters have indicated that additional damage such as rusting resulted from a failure to protect the turbine unit following the initial damage caused by the sea water Enron is concerned that the replacement cost of the wet turbine approximately million will increase if Enron chooses to delay replacing the unit until the insurance company completes its investigation Enron has also asked whether the adjusters statement that Enron should act as a prudent uninsured requires Enron to replace the unit now at the lower cost It is my understanding that Enron does not currently have a project in which it could place the turbine It is also my understanding the Enron does not know whether the repair or replacement cost is likely to increase should Enron delay repairing or replacing the turbine unit until after the insurance company has completed its investigation Section of the Purchase Contract between Enron and Westinghouse requires Enron to maintain cargo insurance to insure Equipment against loss or damage arising from customary allrisk marine perils Section also states that the cargo policy must specify Westinghouse as an additional insured Although the policy I have reviewed does not specifically name Westinghouse as an additional insured I am told by Enron representatives that Westinghouse was in fact properly named as an additional insured on the policy The policy itself contains several clauses that are important to this analysis The Duty of Assured Clause states It is the duty of the Insured and their Agents in all cases to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing a loss and to ensure that all rights against carriers bailees or third parties are properly preserved and exercised The policy also contains a Time for Suit Clause which provides in part No suit or action on this Policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any Court of Law or Equity unless the Insured shall have fully complied with all the terms and conditions of this Policy nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the happening of the loss The policy is silent on the specific issue of what happens in the event that repair or replacement costs increase over time The policy also does not specifically define a prudent uninsured Under New York law however the measure of the duty that is placed on an uninsured owner in this context is that action which a prudent uninsured owner would take under similar circumstances See Intermondale Trading Co v North River Ins Co of New York F Supp SDNY Additionally the Duty of Assured Clause set forth above sets forth a similar reasonableness standard for the conduct of the named Insureds under the policy Thus the prudent uninsured advisory given by the adjuster is a real standard which Enron must consider in making its determination of whether to replace the wet turbine Furthermore the insurance companys ongoing investigation will not operate permit an inference of waiver of a contractual limitations period when the insurer advises the insured to act as a prudent uninsured See Issa v Reliance Ins Co of New York F Supp SDNY Thus Enron should pay careful attention to the Time for Suit Clause which requires that a suit be brought against the Insurer within one year from the date of loss in this case sometime in July of In light of the policy provisions and the prudent uninsured standard the question becomes whether it is prudent for Enron to replace the turbine unit now for million or wait until such time as Enron has a use for the unit or until the Insurer agrees to provide full coverage It is possible that the adjuster will agree with Westinghouse that the unit was a total loss on the date the initial damage occurred However in view of the adjusters April correspondence it is a possibility that the Insurer will maintain that subsequent damage such as rusting occurred as a result of Enron and Westinghouses failure to protect the unit after the initial sea water damage In that case the coverage could be less than the full replacement value Enrons decision to pay for a replacement unit now also requires consideration of the disputes between Enron and Westinghouse regarding delivery and risk of loss Based on our previous analysis of the delivery issues Enron has a plausible legal position that Westinghouse should bear the cost to replace or repair the damaged unit As an additional insured under the policy and in light of its own legal position Westinghouse must also conduct itself in a reasonable manner Why is it any more prudent for Enron to pay to replace the unit now and fight with the insurance company for full coverage then it is for Westinghouse to do the same thing If either party absorbed the cost of the replacement unit now that party would look first to the Insurer for full coverage and failing that would seek to recover the uninsured portion of the replacement from the other party This will not change whether the cost to replace the unit goes up or down Further Westinghouse has control of whether the repair and replacement costs go up or down If Enron chooses not to pay to replace the unit now and the cost goes up Westinghouse would be opening itself up to a larger claim in the event that the Insurer did not cover the full replacement cost Finally it does not appear at this time that Enron is required to purchase the replacement unit now under the prudent uninsured standard First Enron has a good faith position that Westinghouse is obligated to replace the unit because risk of loss had not passed to Enron at the time the unit was damaged Second it is our understanding from discussions with Enron representatives that Enron has no reason to believe that the replacement cost will in fact go up over time Thus Enron has no reason to believe that purchasing the replacement unit now will minimize the loss as required by the Duty of Assured Clause Third Enron does not currently have a project in which it can place the unit When and if Enron did have a project for the unit it would seem prudent to go ahead and purchase the replacement at that time Based on the above analysis Enron can make a compelling argument that it has acted prudently and in accordance with the Purchase Contract and the Policy Enron should note however that the prudent uninsured standard will ultimately be determined by the trier of fact Thus it is ultimately a business decision for Enron whether to go ahead and replace the unit now Additionally Enron may wish to consider filing a declaratory judgment action or other claim against Westinghouse the Insurer or both to determine who will bear the ultimate responsibility with respect to repair and replacement of the damaged unit I trust this email is responsive to your request If you would like a more

meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating As a general rule you should know that under federal law Indian tribes are legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction unless they consent to it They are entitled to establish their own governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law requirements To illustrate with respect to our potential project with them it means we will need to address such issues as getting BIA approval for our site acquisition on Indian land nonIndians can only lease tribal land and for our type of transaction our lease will require approval from the BIA tribal taxes may impact the facility tribal permits licenses etc will apply including tribal environmental laws the tribe may have its own tribal EPA for instance preserving the right to challenge any tribal taxes or regulations in courts other than the tribal courts specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we can subject them to federal court jurisdiction specifically ensuring that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable and specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts Evaluating all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe As you know I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is an expert in Indian law matters As an update on that our other Florida law firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are conflicted out of representing us Presently I am waiting to hear back from an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotelgaming development transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group Although he is based in Wisconsin he is with a very large firm which has offices in Florida and Washington DC and which currently represents Enron on other matters After speaking with him I will further debrief you and if we elect to engage him I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so In the interim I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson Elkins lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes were involved ie right of way agreements involving our pipeline companies He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes I would be happy to share that document with you note that I have tried to summarize most of it above As a result of that memo I do have some changes to incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email I also have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled Energy Business in Indian Country Opportunities and Obstacles if you are having trouble sleeping at night Lastly as for Bill Bryants current activity below based on what youve told me and the email traffic he seems as if he is looking at the right regulatory issues but with an area of law as so complex as this is I would caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research project Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further At a minimum I would suggest that we try to focus on finalizing the letter of intent with the Seminoles so that we can begin the process of exchanging confidential information and entering into more substantive discussions with them Mathew CT AM To Carlos nron cc Subject Re Seminole Indian Tribe Comments from Bill Bryant Forwarded by Mathew GimbleHOUECT on AM Bill L Bryant on AM To cc Subject Re Seminole Indian Tribe Mathew The law looks strong for our position although there is some contrary authority I believe that the contrary Attorney Generals opinion not involving electric generation can be distinguished We are checking with the BIA in Washington and the Governors office to see if there are any recent congressional acts or compacts with the tribe that would govern We are using as the basis for our inquiry a computer facility hypothetical that does not involve electric generation We are also checking for Comprehensive Planning documents that may control land use on the reservation It shouldnt be a problem unless the Plan is considered to be an

explain We have been discussing potential generation opportunities on land owned by SIT One project consists of coalfired generation which would be located on SITs Brighton Reservation and the second project consists of a natural gasfired plant located on a site in Hollywood FL Under either scenario we are curious as to how the Florida Power Plant Siting Act would apply SIT is of the opinion that the Siting Act may not apply to them Before we make any assumptions regarding this matter could you review the matter and let us know your opinion We are considering scheduling a meeting with SIT at the end of next Friday May Do not hesitate to call me at cell with any comments or questions Thanks Mathew M Gimble

MDEA Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around Thanks Kay

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Enron Corp ENE continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of nearterm gas and power in North America but the onetime market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis according to market sources Its not getting any better said one major energy broker Many energy trading companies arent selling to Enron and are only buying from it nearterm These include Aquila Inc ILA Mirant MIR Royal DutchShell Group RD subsidiary Coral Energy Sempra Energy SRE and Morgan Stanley Dean Witters energy trading subsidiary said the broker The broker estimated Enrons overthecounter trading volume to be about of what it was a month ago Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer Some other companies like Dynegy Inc DYN Duke Energy Corp DUK and BP PLC BP continue to trade with Enron fairly freely the broker said Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utilityholding companies PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX also are trading with Enron The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking offsetting trades against deals done long ago These include El Paso Corp EPG Reliant Resources RRI Tractebel SAs BTRB US trading unit and regulated utilities the broker said Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering Theyve been cut off from so many people said one electricity trader Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to of the onemonthago level The notional value of Enrons day rolling average of transactions is billion said Enron spokesman Eric Thode Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago Were not doing daily information Were only speaking in terms of day rolling averages Its not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility Thode said Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enrons trading to restore confidence But after Enrons ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month as concerns about its finances precipitated a drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junkrated debt But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the US Securities Exchange Commission For the first time

Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Nov Reuters Energy trader Dynegy Inc confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp over their proposed merger as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some percent I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters He declined to give further details Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for billion in stock and is currently in a due diligence examination of Enrons complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday The buyout offer finalized Nov would have had Dynegy paying about for each share of Enron but Enrons shares have since cratered to near stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned if at all The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around instead sources familiar with the matter told Reuters Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation given the pressure on its stock price the sources said Enrons shares bounced on Dynegys confirmation of the restructuring talks trading up cents at in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange The shares had dipped as low as in latemorning dealings and as high Dynegys shares gained percent or to move to on the NYSE Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enrons debt past the close of the merger expected in the third quarter of The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least million in cash which Enron has said it was seeking There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline which would be Dynegys consolation prize if the deal fell apart a source said Published reports have said that investment banks JP Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans and may dispute Dynegys ownership if the deal breaks up The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized Theres a solid earnings stream from that thing said one source familiar with the discussions ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enrons equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly employees there are being laid off Enron was not immediately available for comment Those layoffs part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout point to an acute problem for Enron the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise Enrons trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North Americas largest energy trader because of credit concerns This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal If its worth a lot less then Enron is worth less Its vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade But as Enrons stock continued to lose value down over percent since Dynegys initial bid it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around billion from billion at the start of additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb Janet McGurty and

According to The Wall Street Journal Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than of a Dynegy share or about billion The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enrons ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion the person said As the market waits for more details from the two companies some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders also known as arbitrageurs with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target In this way the traders hope to profit as the targets share price moves toward the buyers offer But according to some traders there is too much risk even for those accustomed to uncertainty to play the DynegyEnron deal in this way Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy Enrons fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into offbalancesheet

said noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure it could be several billion dollars said Gheit If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stockexchange ratio said Gheit Under the current acquisition agreement Dynegy would exchange share for each Enron share tendered According to the Wall Street Journal the new ratio is expected to be less than share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock which would value Enron at less than

Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones News that Enron Corp ENE and wouldbe suitor and savior Dynegy Inc DYN are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enrons fate And so far even professional arbitrageurs who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through continue for the most part to stay clear of Enrons stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader Still reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below from has some hedge funds often willing to take more risks looking to place trades on the deal Were trying to figure out a good play said a trader at a New York hedge fund So far bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading somehow hedging a short position on Enrons shares with a long position in some of its bonds People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it a hedge fund manager at another fund said This manager added Were still trying to evaluate different riskreward scenario on the debt and equity sides Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer while taking long positions in the stock of the target company But there is nothing typical about Enrons financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market Some bids are coming in especially on the lower priced bonds said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enrons bonds Enron bonds which had fallen in value in recent weeks gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track albeit at a lower price Enrons bonds due were recently trading at about cents on the dollar up from cents Monday Under the original terms of the deal Enron holders would have gotten of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares Quoting people close to the discussions The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday At current prices a exchange ratio would value Enron at less than a share Essentially this new value if true means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at a share risked losing more than if the merger went through at the ratio it now stands to lose only a share based on the value of Enron stock under the new ratio At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds If the merger doesnt happen Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at stand to benefit by that amount Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about cents on the dollar if it goes through Meanwhile the value of Enron stock is capped at about a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of A lot of the guys are still very skeptical said a bond trader at a New York bank But this is really making the hedge trade easier and weve seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds Still this type of bets isnt for the faint of heart and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position Were nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now But the situation is so volatile that its difficult to be

outstanding or about billion based on Dynegys recent stock price According to the Journal report the new terms could be below of a Dynegy share The deal is critical for Enron which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between million to billion in additional funding to support its operations while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt which totals about billion While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion it is uncertain how long Enrons current funds will allow it to remain solvent Meanwhile a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost k retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enrons stock which has declined more than in the trailing months The suit claims Enron locked down the plan which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares and seeks million for plan losses Although the other recently filed employee suits didnt disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages a CreditSights report said If this is true the CreditSights report said it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from

it done Glen Hilton portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund said its a crapshoot as to whether the deal gets done I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good position for the longterm he said His fund liquidated its Enron holdings completely in mid to lateOctober Enron was the leader in energy trading and its clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot to take up the mantle Hilton pointed to Enrons Q filed last Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the falling share price as potential triggers of the deals material adverse affect clause Those two things could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger If that happens Hilton said an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is

investors dont believe it will happen at least not at the stated price they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than billion The shares closed

executive officer left in August for personal reasons Company officials said they hope to announce perhaps as early as today a series of changes a lower price for the takeover a cash infusion of

now Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with revenue of billion Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enrons reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets Last year Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity tradinga fastpaced complex business quite removed from the companys history as a gas and oilpipeline builder and operator The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills The

if the purchase goes through But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself Enron bills itself as one of the worlds leading energy commodities and services companies It says it markets electricity and natural gas delivers energy and other physical commodities and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world While all this may be true its popularity with investors was based largely on its fastgrowing revenuemuch like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue and indeed Enrons own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused Most of the revenue was generated from trading but the companys shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm Enron was famous for being famous Before the start of the baseball season it purchased the rights to have its name on Houstons new ballpark By Enron Field may need a new name The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy but it means nothing At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas the idea was to call the company Enteron But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means intestines they decided to drop the te in the middle and go with Enron Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy a much smaller company in terms of revenue If the deal falls apart it may want to go back to Enteron

<24162599.1075845852161.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,carlos.sole@enron.com,2001-05-14 07:09:00,Westinghouse Insurance Issueswtg to hear from Andy in terms of whom else to distribute to Forwarded by Carlos SoleNAEnron on PM Thomas Hetherington PM To cc Subject Westinghouse Insurance Issues I have reviewed the insurance policy and selected correspondence relating to the wet turbine issue with Westinghouse Westinghouse has provided estimates to repair the wet turbine for approximately million and to replace it for approximately million The adjusters for the insurance company have advised in correspondence dated April that their investigation is ongoing and that Enron should conduct itself as a prudent uninsured pending a complete investigation of the claim The adjusters have also stated that Underwriters liability will be limited to the reasonable costs of repairs directly caused by the contact of the turbine unit with sea water The adjusters have indicated that additional damage such as rusting resulted from a failure to protect the turbine unit following the initial damage caused by the sea water Enron is concerned that the replacement cost of the wet turbine approximately million will increase if Enron chooses to delay replacing the unit until the insurance company completes its investigation Enron has also asked whether the adjusters statement that Enron should act as a prudent uninsured requires Enron to replace the unit now at the lower cost It is my understanding that Enron does not currently have a project in which it could place the turbine It is also my understanding the Enron does not know whether the repair or replacement cost is likely to increase should Enron delay repairing or replacing the turbine unit until after the insurance company has completed its investigation Section of the Purchase Contract between Enron and Westinghouse requires Enron to maintain cargo insurance to insure Equipment against loss or damage arising from customary allrisk marine perils Section also states that the cargo policy must specify Westinghouse as an additional insured Although the policy I have reviewed does not specifically name Westinghouse as an additional insured I am told by Enron representatives that Westinghouse was in fact properly named as an additional insured on the policy The policy itself contains several clauses that are important to this analysis The Duty of Assured Clause states It is the duty of the Insured and their Agents in all cases to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing a loss and to ensure that all rights against carriers bailees or third parties are properly preserved and exercised The policy also contains a Time for Suit Clause which provides in part No suit or action on this Policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any Court of Law or Equity unless the Insured shall have fully complied with all the terms and conditions of this Policy nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the happening of the loss The policy is silent on the specific issue of what happens in the event that repair or replacement costs increase over time The policy also does not specifically define a prudent uninsured Under New York law however the measure of the duty that is placed on an uninsured owner in this context is that action which a prudent uninsured owner would take under similar circumstances See Intermondale Trading Co v North River Ins Co of New York F Supp SDNY Additionally the Duty of Assured Clause set forth above sets forth a similar reasonableness standard for the conduct of the named Insureds under the policy Thus the prudent uninsured advisory given by the adjuster is a real standard which Enron must consider in making its determination of whether to replace the wet turbine Furthermore the insurance companys ongoing investigation will not operate permit an inference of waiver of a contractual limitations period when the insurer advises the insured to act as a prudent uninsured See Issa v Reliance Ins Co of New York F Supp SDNY Thus Enron should pay careful attention to the Time for Suit Clause which requires that a suit be brought against the Insurer within one year from the date of loss in this case sometime in July of In light of the policy provisions and the prudent uninsured standard the question becomes whether it is prudent for Enron to replace the turbine unit now for million or wait until such time as Enron has a use for the unit or until the Insurer agrees to provide full coverage It is possible that the adjuster will agree with Westinghouse that the unit was a total loss on the date the initial damage occurred However in view of the adjusters April correspondence it is a possibility that the Insurer will maintain that subsequent damage such as rusting occurred as a result of Enron and Westinghouses failure to protect the unit after the initial sea water damage In that case the coverage could be less than the full replacement value Enrons decision to pay for a replacement unit now also requires consideration of the disputes between Enron and Westinghouse regarding delivery and risk of loss Based on our previous analysis of the delivery issues Enron has a plausible legal position that Westinghouse should bear the cost to replace or repair the damaged unit As an additional insured under the policy and in light of its own legal position Westinghouse must also conduct itself in a reasonable manner Why is it any more prudent for Enron to pay to replace the unit now and fight with the insurance company for full coverage then it is for Westinghouse to do the same thing If either party absorbed the cost of the replacement unit now that party would look first to the Insurer for full coverage and failing that would seek to recover the uninsured portion of the replacement from the other party This will not change whether the cost to replace the unit goes up or down Further Westinghouse has control of whether the repair and replacement costs go up or down If Enron chooses not to pay to replace the unit now and the cost goes up Westinghouse would be opening itself up to a larger claim in the event that the Insurer did not cover the full replacement cost Finally it does not appear at this time that Enron is required to purchase the replacement unit now under the prudent uninsured standard First Enron has a good faith position that Westinghouse is obligated to replace the unit because risk of loss had not passed to Enron at the time the unit was damaged Second it is our understanding from discussions with Enron representatives that Enron has no reason to believe that the replacement cost will in fact go up over time Thus Enron has no reason to believe that purchasing the replacement unit now will minimize the loss as required by the Duty of Assured Clause Third Enron does not currently have a project in which it can place the unit When and if Enron did have a project for the unit it would seem prudent to go ahead and purchase the replacement at that time Based on the above analysis Enron can make a compelling argument that it has acted prudently and in accordance with the Purchase Contract and the Policy Enron should note however that the prudent uninsured standard will ultimately be determined by the trier of fact Thus it is ultimately a business decision for Enron whether to go ahead and replace the unit now Additionally Enron may wish to consider filing a declaratory judgment action or other claim against Westinghouse the Insurer or both to determine who will bear the ultimate responsibility with respect to repair and replacement of the damaged unit I trust this email is responsive to your request If you would like a more detailed analysis in memo form please let me know TFAH

obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around Thanks Kay

MDEA Original Message From Mann Kay Sent Wednesday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around Thanks Kay

<20869426.1075845908172.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,carlos.sole@enron.com,2001-05-18 06:05:00,Re Seminole Indian Tribe Project Cc Per our conversation yesterday I would reiterate the importance of a team meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating As a general rule you should know that under federal law Indian tribes are legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction unless they consent to it They are entitled to establish their own governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law requirements To illustrate with respect to our potential project with them it means we will need to address such issues as getting BIA approval for our site acquisition on Indian land nonIndians can only lease tribal land and for our type of transaction our lease will require approval from the BIA tribal taxes may impact the facility tribal permits licenses etc will apply including tribal environmental laws the tribe may have its own tribal EPA for instance preserving the right to challenge any tribal taxes or regulations in courts other than the tribal courts specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we can subject them to federal court jurisdiction specifically ensuring that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable and specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts Evaluating all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe As you know I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is an expert in Indian law matters As an update on that our other Florida law firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are conflicted out of representing us Presently I am waiting to hear back from an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotelgaming development transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group Although he is based in Wisconsin he is with a very large firm which has offices in Florida and Washington DC and which currently represents Enron on other matters After speaking with him I will further debrief you and if we elect to engage him I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so In the interim I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson Elkins lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes were involved ie right of way agreements involving our pipeline companies He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes I would be happy to share that document with you note that I have tried to summarize most of it above As a result of that memo I do have some changes to incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email I also have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled Energy Business in Indian Country Opportunities and Obstacles if you are having trouble sleeping at night Lastly as for Bill Bryants current activity below based on what youve told me and the email traffic he seems as if he is looking at the right regulatory issues but with an area of law as so complex as this is I would caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research project Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further At a minimum I would suggest that we try to focus on finalizing the letter of intent with the Seminoles so that we can begin the process of exchanging confidential information and entering into more substantive discussions with them Mathew CT AM To Carlos nron cc Subject Re Seminole Indian Tribe Comments from Bill Bryant Forwarded by Mathew GimbleHOUECT on AM Bill L Bryant on AM To cc Subject Re Seminole Indian Tribe Mathew The law looks strong for our position although there is some contrary authority I believe that the contrary Attorney Generals opinion not involving electric generation can be distinguished We are checking with the BIA in Washington and the Governors office to see if there are any recent congressional acts or compacts with the tribe that would govern We are using as the basis for our inquiry a computer facility hypothetical that does not involve electric generation We are also checking for Comprehensive Planning documents that may control land use on the reservation It shouldnt be a problem unless the Plan is considered to be an

project consists of a natural gasfired plant located on a site in Hollywood FL Under either scenario we are curious as to how the Florida Power Plant Siting Act would apply SIT is of the opinion that the Siting Act may not apply to them Before we make any assumptions regarding this matter could you review the matter and let us know your opinion We are considering scheduling a meeting with SIT at

SoleNAEnron on PM Thomas Hetherington PM To cc Subject Westinghouse Insurance Issues I have reviewed the insurance policy and selected correspondence relating to the wet turbine issue with Westinghouse Westinghouse has provided estimates to repair the wet turbine for approximately million and to replace it for approximately million The adjusters for the insurance company have advised in correspondence dated April that their investigation is ongoing and that Enron should conduct itself as a prudent uninsured pending a complete investigation of the claim The adjusters have also stated that Underwriters liability will be limited to the reasonable costs of repairs directly caused by the contact of the turbine unit with sea water The adjusters have indicated that additional damage such as rusting resulted from a failure to protect the turbine unit following the initial damage caused by the sea water Enron is concerned that the replacement cost of the wet turbine approximately million will increase if Enron chooses to delay replacing the unit until the insurance company completes its investigation Enron has also asked whether the adjusters statement that Enron should act as a prudent uninsured requires Enron to replace the unit now at the lower cost It is my understanding that Enron does not currently have a project in which it could place the turbine It is also my understanding the Enron does not know whether the repair or replacement cost is likely to increase should Enron delay repairing or replacing the turbine unit until after the insurance company has completed its investigation Section of the Purchase Contract between Enron and Westinghouse requires Enron to maintain cargo insurance to insure Equipment against loss or damage arising from customary allrisk marine perils Section also states that the cargo policy must specify Westinghouse as an additional insured Although the policy I have reviewed does not specifically name Westinghouse as an additional insured I am told by Enron representatives that Westinghouse was in fact properly named as an additional insured on the policy The policy itself contains several clauses that are important to this analysis The Duty of Assured Clause states It is the duty of the Insured and their Agents in all cases to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing a loss and to ensure that all rights against carriers bailees or third parties are properly preserved and exercised The policy also contains a Time for Suit Clause which provides in part No suit or action on this Policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any Court of Law or Equity unless the Insured shall have fully complied with all the terms and conditions of this Policy nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the happening of the loss The policy is silent on the specific issue of what happens in the event that repair or replacement costs increase over time The policy also does not specifically define a prudent uninsured Under New York law however the measure of the duty that is placed on an uninsured owner in this context is that action which a prudent uninsured owner would take under similar circumstances See Intermondale Trading Co v North River Ins Co of New York F Supp SDNY Additionally the Duty of Assured Clause set forth above sets forth a similar reasonableness standard for the conduct of the named Insureds under the policy Thus the prudent uninsured advisory given by the adjuster is a real standard which Enron must consider in making its determination of whether to replace the wet turbine Furthermore the insurance companys ongoing investigation will not operate permit an inference of waiver of a contractual limitations period when the insurer advises the insured to act as a prudent uninsured See Issa v Reliance Ins Co of New York F Supp SDNY Thus Enron should pay careful attention to the Time for Suit Clause which requires that a suit be brought against the Insurer within one year from the date of loss in this case sometime in July of In light of the policy provisions and the prudent uninsured standard the question becomes whether it is prudent for Enron to replace the turbine unit now for million or wait until such time as Enron has a use for the unit or until the Insurer agrees to provide full coverage It is possible that the adjuster will agree with Westinghouse that the unit was a total loss on the date the initial damage occurred However in view of the adjusters April correspondence it is a possibility that the Insurer will maintain that subsequent damage such as rusting occurred as a result of Enron and Westinghouses failure to protect the unit after the initial sea water damage In that case the coverage could be less than the full replacement value Enrons decision to pay for a replacement unit now also requires consideration of the disputes between Enron and Westinghouse regarding delivery and risk of loss Based on our previous analysis of the delivery issues Enron has a plausible legal position that Westinghouse should bear the cost to replace or repair the damaged unit As an additional insured under the policy and in light of its own legal position Westinghouse must also conduct itself in a reasonable manner Why is it any more prudent for Enron to pay to replace the unit now and fight with the insurance company for full coverage then it is for Westinghouse to do the same thing If either party absorbed the cost of the replacement unit now that party would look first to the Insurer for full coverage and failing that would seek to recover the uninsured portion of the replacement from the other party This will not change whether the cost to replace the unit goes up or down Further Westinghouse has control of whether the repair and replacement costs go up or down If Enron chooses not to pay to replace the unit now and the cost goes up Westinghouse would be opening itself up to a larger claim in the event that the Insurer did not cover the full replacement cost Finally it does not appear at this time that Enron is required to purchase the replacement unit now under the prudent uninsured standard First Enron has a good faith position that Westinghouse is obligated to replace the unit because risk of loss had not passed to Enron at the time the unit was damaged Second it is our understanding from discussions with Enron representatives that Enron has no reason to believe that the replacement cost will in fact go up over time Thus Enron has no reason to believe that purchasing the replacement unit now will minimize the loss as required by the Duty of Assured Clause Third Enron does not currently have a project in which it can place the unit When and if Enron did have a project for the unit it would seem prudent to go ahead and purchase the replacement at that time Based on the above analysis Enron can make a compelling argument that it has acted prudently and in accordance with the Purchase Contract and the Policy Enron should note however that the prudent uninsured standard will ultimately be determined by the trier of fact Thus it is ultimately a business decision for Enron whether to go ahead and replace the unit now Additionally Enron may wish to consider filing a declaratory judgment action or other claim against Westinghouse the Insurer or both to determine who will bear the ultimate responsibility with respect to repair and replacement of the damaged unit I trust this email is responsive to your request If you would like a more detailed analysis in memo form please let me know TFAH
