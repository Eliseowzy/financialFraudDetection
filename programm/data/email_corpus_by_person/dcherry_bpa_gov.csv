Special Offer to NY Times customers Spend ship free at Starbuckscom adsstarbucksemailhtml Foundation Gives Way on Chiefs Big Dream November By JOHN SCHWARTZ and RICHARD A OPPEL Jr Well before anyone could imagine that Enron might collapse Kenneth L Lay was stumped In an interview in August he dismissed questions about a vague clause in the energy companys annual report that hinted at bigger problems if its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels I just cant help you on that he said Pressed further on questions about a bewildering constellation of business partnerships that involved Enrons former chief financial officer he said Youre getting way over my head At the least Mr Lay a man of big ideas a crusader for free markets a risk taker in the Texas wildcatter tradition had taken his eye off the ball While he was busy befriending the nations most powerful politicians erecting one of the tallest buildings in Houston and pasting Enrons logo on the citys new ballpark the little things were turning out to be Mr Lays big problems One after another disclosures spilled out of his company over the last month the partnerships had hidden billions in debt years of Enrons reported profits had been exaggerated the government was investigating Rivals were shunning Enrons energy trading desks which Mr Lay had built into the worlds leaders And sure enough the stock price tumbled day after day and credit agencies lowered Enrons ratings once and then yesterday again turning the companys debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock Three weeks ago Mr Lay tried to salvage his creation by selling it to Dynegy his Houston rival Yesterday Dynegy pulled out of the deal Deprived of enough information and then repelled by what they learned the free markets in which Mr Lay had put so much faith all but destroyed in a matter of weeks everything he had built If they had been going a slower speed the results would not have been disastrous said Bob McNair a Houston energy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company to Enron three years ago But Enron he said in an interview this month was like a race car and the markets like an unforgiving track Its a lot harder to keep it on the track at miles per hour he said You hit a bump and youre off the track From his youth Mr Lay had nurtured an abiding faith in the markets wisdom He studied economics at the University of Missouri living at home to save on room and board and eventually earned a PhD in the subject As a naval officer serving in the Pentagon he worked to develop more efficient accounting systems Later he served as an aide to a federal government regulator for the natural gas industry a market that Enron would come to dominate Moving into the private sector he worked his way up the ranks of the natural gas industry becoming chief executive in of the Houston Natural Gas Corporation a big regional pipeline operator He engineered its merger with Internorth an Omaha pipeline company and then became chief executive of the combined company and changed its name to Enron Mr Lay saw Enrons mission as far more than being a conduit for fuel At the time gas prices were regulated and pipelines played a relatively passive role buyers and sellers could not cut deals on the fly But as oil prices plunged in the mids and gas users began switching to cheaper fuel oil Mr Lay returned to Washington to argue successfully for rules changes that he said would save the pipeline business by allowing operators to shop for the best deals from both gas producers and utilities The new flexibility brought the threat of chaos however as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly That is when the new Enron was truly born To help customers shield themselves from risk Mr Lays Enron developed hedging contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn and copper and winter wheat Its innovative gas bank let utilities lock up the longterm prices that they craved Enron lined up the gas supplies from producers arranged for delivery and took a cut of every deal That business became the forerunner of Enrons entry into hundreds of other markets helping customers obtain supplies and manage risks in products ranging from electric power to pulp and paper and most recently fast broadband access to the Internet Trading soon provided more of the companys profits than the traditional natural gas business While other companies including Dynegy focused on accumulating hard assets like pipelines turbines and gas fields Enron increasingly saw itself as a pure trading company with an almost limitless future There is a very reasonable chance that we will become the biggest corporation in the world Mr Lays handpicked successor as Enrons chief executive Jeffrey K Skilling told the authors of a book just published about business on the Internet Even the books title Radical E From GE to Enron Lessons on How to Rule the Web PricewaterhouseCoopers showed the cachet the company had attained Enron the authors wrote was creating a culture in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and rewarded Mr Skilling abruptly resigned in August after just six months on the job propelling Mr Lay back into the gritty details of Enrons businesses that he had sought to leave to others As the company grew he had become increasingly involved in public affairs serving as host when a global economic conference was held in Houston in and when the Republican National Convention came to the city in Like the leaders of many big Texas businesses the construction colossus Brown Root after World War II or Ross Perots Electronic Data Systems in the s Mr Lay knew the value of courting politicians and policy makers He played golf with President Bill Clinton became good friends with the Texas governor Ann Richards and supported Senator Phil Gramm of Texas whose wife Wendy a former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission joined Enrons board Hes a standup guy said Ms Richards now a business consultant in New York Asked to be more specific she said Hes at the meeting meaning she could count on Mr Lay to become directly involved with whatever she asked him to do and not just sign onto a project for show Mr Lays deepest political ties were with the Bush family In the s he became a major fundraiser for George H W Bush When Mr Bush lost his campaign for re election as president Mr Lay brought a number of senior Bush aides to Enron as directors or consultants including James A Baker III the former secretary of state and Robert A Mosbacher the former secretary of commerce Mr Lay also cultivated Mr Bushs son George W long before he was considered a serious national candidate After the younger Mr Bushs election as Texas governor in Mr Lay became head of the Governors Business Council an important advisory post The bond with President Bush is personal As governor Mr Bush sent Mr Lay a kidding note in One of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older just like you he wrote years old Wow That is really old Thank goodness you have such a young beautiful wife he added a reference to Mr Lays wife Linda In Mr Lay sent a handwritten Christmas note to Mr Bush and his wife Laura Linda and I are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the White House he wrote Yesterday the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the Treasury Department was monitoring Enrons downfall for its effect on the market Asked if the president himself had any reaction Mr Fleisher said The presidents reaction is that it should be monitored In some ways Enrons collapse was one more example of the bursting of the Internet bubble But Mr Lay was not some stylish dotcom brat by all accounts he is an immensely likable product of Middle America Growing up in tiny Rush Hill Mo he was driving a tractor by age and salting away savings By his sister Sharon recalled this week he was bucking bales that is loading hay and had two jobs in the summer painting houses I dont think you could ever say that he did something the easy way she said That work ethic ran in the family Mr Lays father was a minister who also sold farm equipment The familys finances were spotty at times no money at times some money Ms Lay recalled Still the Lays took in people from their church who were in need Over the last decade or so Mr Lay earned some million from Enron mostly by exercising stock options Earlier this month when employees grew incensed at the prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the companys sale to Dynegy he volunteered to walk away from million in payments Mr McNair the Houston entrepreneur who has known Mr Lay for years suggested that perhaps everything had not been disclosed to him Maybe the people who reported to him told him what they wanted him to hear but they werent telling him everything he said Mr McNair said he spoke to Mr Lay recently and found him somewhat in a state of shock Mr McNair added Hes devastated In the end it seems the man whose company did so much to help others manage their risk could not manage his own businessLAYhtmlexeienedbb
