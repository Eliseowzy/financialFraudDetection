you didnt also haveremember you asked me to fax it to you also what thinkest thou about the FERC order D wrote Dorothy Thanks very much for the meeting yesterday From my perspective it was very useful Per yesterdays conversation More much to follow soon This is what we gave the Govenor Hertzberg Burton Brulte etc about months ago ie prior to Davis announcement etc You know how to get a hold of me Best Jeff Proposal to Alleviate Californias Electricity Shortage Through Incentives to Reduce Demand Objective Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in anticipation of Summer electricity demand Proposal The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately conduct online auctions for demand reductions totaling at least MWs Alternatively DWR could run the auction and implement the buydown program However if it is determined that DWR requires additional authority to execute the auction the State should avoid any further delays and direct the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buydown program immediately The Auction Process assuming the utilities implement the program Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reductions through November would submit bids indicating the price they would be willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction If the supply of available reductions offered in the auction exceeds MWs the utility should accept them or explain to the Commission why they chose not to accept them Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continued payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone due to demand reductions A Single Price Approach A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key disadvantages First customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser price will be overpaid much in the same way the single price auction in the PC overpaid lower cost generators The state would overpay for reduced demand under the single price approach Second the single price may not attract sufficient demand reductions Further the single price approach does not provide greater certainty regarding the cost of demand reductions By conducting an auction the state will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis starting with the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to the cost the state is willing to pay A single price approach however could work if targeted at customers who would not participate in an auction ie residential customers A well publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than last year would further reduce demand in the state Thus the auction and the single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consumers since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service interruptions caused by the demand reductions If DWR implements the program DWR would recover its costs through rates similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs If the utilities implement the program the California PUC would include program costs in rates collected from customers The auction should be conducted online which will increase transparency and reduce the time required to complete the process Hazards to Avoid Avoid allowing lengthy utility andor PUC review to delay implementation of the reductions Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer There are numerous firms offering moderatelypriced online auction services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility The utility should immediately contract for online services and present the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple streamlined set of prequalification criteria that would apply to bidders The prequalification criteria should be designed with the goal of making participation as easy and expansive as possible Prequalification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transaction time Once the PUC has approved the auction process the PUC should not apply any additional review to the auction results Auction preapproval will ensure that the utilities are actively and constructively engaged Actions Governors office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential program CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within days Establish abbreviated schedule Provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment Finalize decision approving auction proposal within days of utility submission CPUC rules in advance that results of auction are prudent and utilities conduct auction by May

Tuesday July in the San Jose Mercury News BY MARK GLADSTONE NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO Six months after jumping into the electricity business the Davis administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of Californias daily power purchases showing more than billion in payments much of it to governmentowned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers The state spent an additional billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data In roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out billion to Atlantabased Mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by billion to Powerex the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia It also paid million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis For instance almost percent of the states purchases have come from governmentrun power generators in California and elsewhere but not Texas some of the biggest suppliers are from the Northwest Gov Gray Davis who has ambitions to run for the White House has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in President Bushs home state The figures are tucked inside of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more The state which last month released information on its longterm electricity contracts worth billion agreed Thursday to release the first quarter details Short on explanation The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water Resources which buys power for the states financially strapped major utilities and seem to buttress the administrations contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease In January for instance the average price for power on the spot market was a megawatt hour It peaked in April at and dropped to in May One megawatt powers about homes Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governors assertions that California has been gouged The bad guys are clearly the outofstate generators Maviglio said There has been a significant shift of money out of California But the documents fail to shed much light on whether as the administration contends the price drop was due to longterm power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year Critics contend that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years Used for support Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis a Democrat for signing longterm contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants Its more clear than ever that the longterm contracts are a bad deal said Assemblyman Tony Strickland RCamarillo The governors really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or years The newly released bills highlight the volatility of Californias energy market where the price per megawatt hour ranged from to On any given day the records show the prices from seller to seller varied widely with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside Texas On one day in February for example San Diegobased Sempra Energy was charging per megawatt hour the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly and Duke Energy a North Carolina company was charging up to The states daily spending peaked May at million for all power including the spot market and contracted power The state began buying power in midJanuary on behalf of the states major utilities which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity San Josebased Calpine Corp which is building several new power plants around California including one in South San Jose did only million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year according to the figures The state began buying power in midJanuary when Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co were on the ropes financially PGE later went into bankruptcy On Monday state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing Edison While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison will not win the necessary support in the Legislature lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives Compromise plan On Monday state Sen Byron Sher DRedwood City unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the Edison bailout The shared pain proposal would force power producers owed about billion to take a percent haircut and agree to forgive about million in Edison debts Edison would be asked to swallow billion about a third of its debt And big users would be asked to pay off the remaining billion in debts possibly by paying higher prices for power In exchange large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the

Best Jeff Power purchase bills exceed billion Published Tuesday July in the San Jose Mercury News BY MARK GLADSTONE NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO Six months after jumping into the electricity business the Davis administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of Californias daily power purchases showing more than billion in payments much of it to governmentowned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers The state spent an additional billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data In roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out billion to Atlantabased Mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by billion to Powerex the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia It also paid million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis For instance almost percent of the states purchases have come from governmentrun power generators in California and elsewhere but not Texas some of the biggest suppliers are from the Northwest Gov Gray Davis who has ambitions to run for the White House has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in President Bushs home state The figures are tucked inside of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more The state which last month released information on its longterm electricity contracts worth billion agreed Thursday to release the first quarter details Short on explanation The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water Resources which buys power for the states financially strapped major utilities and seem to buttress the administrations contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease In January for instance the average price for power on the spot market was a megawatt hour It peaked in April at and dropped to in May One megawatt powers about homes Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governors assertions that California has been gouged The bad guys are clearly the outofstate generators Maviglio said There has been a significant shift of money out of California But the documents fail to shed much light on whether as the administration contends the price drop was due to longterm power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year Critics contend that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years Used for support Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis a Democrat for signing longterm contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants Its more clear than ever that the longterm contracts are a bad deal said Assemblyman Tony Strickland RCamarillo The governors really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or years The newly released bills highlight the volatility of Californias energy market where the price per megawatt hour ranged from to On any given day the records show the prices from seller to seller varied widely with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside Texas On one day in February for example San Diegobased Sempra Energy was charging per megawatt hour the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly and Duke Energy a North Carolina company was charging up to The states daily spending peaked May at million for all power including the spot market and contracted power The state began buying power in midJanuary on behalf of the states major utilities which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity San Josebased Calpine Corp which is building several new power plants around California including one in South San Jose did only million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year according to the figures The state began buying power in midJanuary when Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co were on the ropes financially PGE later went into bankruptcy On Monday state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing Edison While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison will not win the necessary support in the Legislature lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives Compromise plan On Monday state Sen Byron Sher DRedwood City unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the Edison bailout The shared pain proposal would force power producers owed about billion to take a percent haircut and agree to forgive about million in Edison debts Edison would be asked to swallow billion about a third of its debt And big users would be asked to pay off the remaining billion in debts possibly by paying higher prices for power In exchange large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the Legislature Contact Mark Gladstone at or

you didnt also haveremember you asked me to fax it to you also what thinkest thou about the FERC order D wrote Dorothy Thanks very much for the meeting yesterday From my perspective it was very useful Per yesterdays conversation More much to follow soon This is what we gave the Govenor Hertzberg Burton Brulte etc about months ago ie prior to Davis announcement etc You know how to get a hold of me Best Jeff Proposal to Alleviate Californias Electricity Shortage Through Incentives to Reduce Demand Objective Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in anticipation of Summer electricity demand Proposal The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately conduct online auctions for demand reductions totaling at least MWs Alternatively DWR could run the auction and implement the buydown program However if it is determined that DWR requires additional authority to execute the auction the State should avoid any further delays and direct the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buydown program immediately The Auction Process assuming the utilities implement the program Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reductions through November would submit bids indicating the price they would be willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction If the supply of available reductions offered in the auction exceeds MWs the utility should accept them or explain to the Commission why they chose not to accept them Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continued payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone due to demand reductions A Single Price Approach A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key disadvantages First customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser price will be overpaid much in the same way the single price auction in the PC overpaid lower cost generators The state would overpay for reduced demand under the single price approach Second the single price may not attract sufficient demand reductions Further the single price approach does not provide greater certainty regarding the cost of demand reductions By conducting an auction the state will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis starting with the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to the cost the state is willing to pay A single price approach however could work if targeted at customers who would not participate in an auction ie residential customers A well publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than last year would further reduce demand in the state Thus the auction and the single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consumers since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service interruptions caused by the demand reductions If DWR implements the program DWR would recover its costs through rates similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs If the utilities implement the program the California PUC would include program costs in rates collected from customers The auction should be conducted online which will increase transparency and reduce the time required to complete the process Hazards to Avoid Avoid allowing lengthy utility andor PUC review to delay implementation of the reductions Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer There are numerous firms offering moderatelypriced online auction services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility The utility should immediately contract for online services and present the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple streamlined set of prequalification criteria that would apply to bidders The prequalification criteria should be designed with the goal of making participation as easy and expansive as possible Prequalification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transaction time Once the PUC has approved the auction process the PUC should not apply any additional review to the auction results Auction preapproval will ensure that the utilities are actively and constructively engaged Actions Governors office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential program CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within days Establish abbreviated schedule Provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment Finalize decision approving auction proposal within days of utility submission CPUC rules in advance that results of auction are prudent and utilities conduct auction by May
