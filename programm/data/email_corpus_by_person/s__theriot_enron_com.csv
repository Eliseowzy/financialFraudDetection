Importance High Tana Youre the best person I know to answer the questions Cindy has regarding financial trading Let me know if I can add anything Thanks Debbie Original Message From Horn Cindy Sent Monday November AM To Brackett Debbie R Subject FW Issue to be resolved and acted upon Importance High Hi Debbie hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTCs once How did this work for financials was it from a Tagg feed Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one Thanks Cindy Original Message From Nolte Ron Sent Saturday November PM To Horn Cindy Whiting Elaine Timson Sarah Das Sarita Hunter Larry Joe Bonanno Joann Sorenson Jefferson D Leggett Tim Callaghan Shawna Subject Issue to be resolved and acted upon Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal Issue Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL it does not mean that there is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties the Contract Number eg is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney This needs to be verified I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for GKCOM uses the internal party the external party the product the document type eg Master Purchase Sale Firm the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract First of all who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for There a gazillion different types of contract agreements If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for Second a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world Every product has to be set up See under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade Also there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party Remember DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal For London deals if the deal is Petchems or MTBE Enron confirms For some products if it is a Brokered sale then the Broker confirms if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco BP Texaco or ExxonMobile then the Counterparty confirms For all other Liquids a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker Currently it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered You can indicate in Global Contracts that the product is Any But Any could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas Power and Industrial Markets That is you cant indicate to Global Contracts that Any means Any Global Product Any means anything OK so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot provide a contract for all deals If that is the case then the transaction will be kicked out will not get to DCAF II until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney If this happens it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within hours Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers As such someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is which template format out of the hundreds available should be used The value in DCAF can only be realized if the someone is removed from the processing Bottom Line DCAF II needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal the correct Governing Law Arbitration and Jurisdiction For gas deals the contract provides the relevant information The Global Products world is much more complicated Decision If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities Determining and implementing what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support Global Products Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading partners Defining the business rules required to populate the XML message with the appropriate Contract Agreement Type needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny Setting up a means for testing this process prior to and as part of the User Acceptance Test
