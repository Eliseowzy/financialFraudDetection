description of the position in the US a salary range for that position CO and Cost Center Please let me have this at your earliest convenience Many thanks Margaret Enron North America Corp From Molly Magee PM To Margaret CT cc Vince J CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update Once again Margaret we are in your debt Vince lets get together some time next week and see where you would like us to go with this Molly Margaret Daffin PM To Molly CT cc Vince J CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update Molly just to be sure that everyone understands Anshuman cannot work in the US on a B visa he can only come here for business meetings and training We will have to get him the L visa in order for him to work in the US Margaret Enron North America Corp From Molly Magee PM To Vince J CT cc Margaret CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update Thank you so much for the information Vince I hope that you have a great weekend Molly Vince J Kaminski PM To Molly CT cc Vince J CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update Molly I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week I have just learned that Anshuman has B visa and he can start on a project as a person delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston To be absolutely above the line I would still arrange the L visa Vince Enron North America Corp From Molly Magee AM To Vince J CT cc Margaret CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update I agree that it makes sense to put the L in place There are several things we will need from you in order to start the visa process The first is a fairly detailed job description for Anshuman Secondly we also need to know whether or not he will be in a managerial position here andor managing a project If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job description just let me know and I will be happy to contact himher As for Sandeep I have been told that he is a US resident so there should be no problems with him Margaret Daffin will be contacting him to be absolutely sure Thanks Molly Vince J Kaminski AM To Molly CT cc Vince J CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update Molly Lets get L for Anshuman just in case I am sure he will stay here for a while once he comes It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him longer given the priority of the project I assume there are no problems with Sandeep Thanks Vince Enron North America Corp From Molly Magee AM To Vince J CT cc Margaret CT Subject Re Transition to Research Group An Update Thank you for the update Vince I have been working with Margaret Daffin with regard to Anshumans visa status We will have to get an L visa in place before he can come to the United States even in a temporary capacity Do you want to move forward with that effort at this time or is the possibility of him coming to the US so remote that it wouldnt be worth the time and money right now Molly Vince J Kaminski AM To Molly CT cc Vince J CT Subject Transition to Research Group An Update Molly This is an update on Anshuman Please see below It seems that his transfer is not an issue for the time being We can put it on a backburner till he gets here Vince PS The relevant section I also spoke about Anshuman and there was resistance to his leaing for such a long time However I have agreement from folks here to send him to Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget I will try to finalize that before I leave I will call you in the evening to just chat Forwarded by Vince J KaminskiHOUECT on AM Sandeep NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Vince J CT cc Subject Transition
