pnbspUpdated Friday September brnbsp AM ET brnbsp pnbspBy Jessica Berthold pnbspOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES pnbspThis article was originally published Thursday pnbspLOS ANGELES Dow JonesA California Senate committee will brnbspdepose former board members and managers of the states wholesale brnbsppower market operator next week as part of an investigation into brnbspwhether those officials collaborated with suppliers to increase electricity brnbspprices in the state the committees chairman said pnbspThe investigation by the Senate Select Committee To Investigate Price brnbspManipulation centers on an emergency request filed with federal brnbspregulators last December to lift a per megawatthour price cap on brnbspthe market run by the California Independent System Operator pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp The Federal Energy brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Regulatory Commission brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp agreed to lift the cap three brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp hours after receiving the brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp request which was filed by brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp ISO Chief Executive Terry brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Winter pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Committee Chairman Sen Joe brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Dunn DSanta Ana said brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Wednesday the price cap was brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp the states last line of brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp defense against runaway brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp wholesale electricity prices brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Within three days of the caps brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp being lifted wholesale prices brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp had nearly tripled to brnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp MWh the beginning of brnbspmonths of extremely high prices that marked the worst of the states brnbspelectricity crisis he said pnbspWinter who remains in his post has said he acted quickly on his own brnbspinitiative to do what was necessary to keep power flowing to the state pnbspBut Dunn whose committee began serving subpoenas this week brnbspsaid the length and complexity of Winters page filing doesnt jibe brnbspwith Winters claim that he acted alone and at the last minute in making brnbspthe request pnbspWere trying to determine who he was working with that led to the brnbspfiling and whether there was generator involvement Dunn said It also brnbspdoesnt seem right that Winter who owes his employment to the board brnbspwould run around them pnbspThe former member ISO board was a mishmash of generators and brnbspother industry stakeholders as well as consumer advocates and brnbsprepresentatives of municipal utilities Gov Gray Davis replaced that brnbspboard in January with five members pointedly chosen for their lack of brnbspaffiliation with ISO market participants The political nature of those brnbspappointments however has called into question the boards brnbspindependence an issue now being examined by FERC pnbspBoard Members Say They Werent Notified pnbspMike Florio a consumer advocate who is the only current board brnbspmember to have served on the old board said he had no knowledge of brnbspWinters FERC filing pnbspI was surprised that something that monumental was done without brnbspbeing consulted said Florio who received a subpoena Wednesday I brnbspcould see the decision to file being made at the last minute but brnbspobviously someone had to do the preparation work and while that was brnbspbeing done there would have been time for consultation pnbspFlorio said that at that time the board was polarized on the issue of brnbspprice caps with those representing generators and large businesses brnbspagainst them and municipal utilities and residential customers for brnbspthem pnbspJan SmutnyJones a former board member and president of the brnbspIndependent Energy Producers Association a generators group also brnbspsaid he didnt know in advance about Winters filing pnbspBoard members were not consulted regardless of their status in the brnbspmarketplace said SmutnyJones who received his subpoena Tuesday brnbspI understand why Winter made the filing Hes the CEO of the ISO brnbspand he has that authority In November and December the market was brnbspcollapsing rapidly and the board was politicized to the point of brnbspdysfunction He did what he thought he needed to do pnbspISO spokesman Greg Fishman said Winter absolutely did not collude brnbspwith generators and said the move to lift the cap actually helped brnbspcontrol prices paid by the ISO which is responsible for keeping the brnbsplights on in the state pnbspRather than limit prices the caps simply drove suppliers into uncapped brnbspmarkets outside the state Fishman said The ISO then had to buy back brnbspthat outofmarket power at uncapped prices pnbspThe official market price on Dec was a megawatthour but the brnbspprice for us was really a megawatthour Fishman said brnbspInmarket prices did spike after the December order for a few days brnbspbut after the spike they went down under a megawatthour The brnbsporder also gave us the ability to ask suppliers to justify their bids It brnbspessentially brought them under our umbrella pnbspThe subpoenas request email telephone travel and meeting records brnbspamong other items Further subpoenas may be issued Dunn said brnbsphtml
