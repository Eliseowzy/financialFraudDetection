Woods Steve Cc Donovan Bill Hagen Bob McFarland Jean Rahn Nick Abshire Scott Subject RE Physical Security of Gas Control and related computer and telecommunications rooms Steve Back on September th I sent you the note below asking for guidance and assistance on some security issues I havent gotten any response from you The facilities help desk did get the service elevator monitor in Gas Control fixed I would still like to work with someone to address the bulleted issues I listed in the original note below In addition to those there are a couple more issues that have surfaced recently Given the planned restacking of the building and the significant increase in employees housed in EB how does this impact the evacuation plan for the building when a complete evacuation is required Woods Steve Compared to our present population at Enron Center North EB the population will actually be less once all moves are completed Woods Steve The evacuation we completed on after the NY disaster went very quickly and without incident How are we supposed to be notified afterhours of weather related or any other events that security considers a threat to the building where they are recommending evacuation During a recent weather event we were inside Gas Control I believe it was Thursday evening and we did not get any notification but we have been told that security was on a number of floors telling employees to evacuate due to a tornado threatening downtown Woods Steve Security console is supposed to notify Gas Control when weather approaches we have reviewed these procedures and they are in place I will ask security to follow up on this issue Let me know who to work with Thanks Gary Original Message From Abshire Scott Sent Monday September AM To Kenagy Gary Woods Steve Cc Donovan

Enron background investigation has already been performed Scott Original Message From Kenagy Gary Sent Monday September AM To Woods Steve Cc Donovan Bill Abshire Scott Hagen Bob McFarland Jean Rahn Nick Subject Physical Security of Gas Control and related computer and telecommunications rooms Steve Who do I initiate conversations with to review the physical building security issues listed below Recent events would suggest that we need to be auditing these issues routinely I assume you have worked with Wackenhut consultants or some other organization to perform these types of reviews in the past These issues are generally addressed as secondary issues in the IT audits but I think it might be best to address physical security reviews using qualified security professionals rather than IT auditors Bob Hagen and Jean McFarland are working on some significant enhancements to our existing Business Continuity processes and this would fit right in Please let us know who we can work with to begin the review of the issues below ASAP By the way I called the facilities help desk with two issues last week and havent heard back from anyone The EB service elevator lobby video monitoring from the Gas Control Center is not working and the service elevator doors on EB do not lock properly Thanks in advance for your help Gary x What are the current risks of unauthorized personnel or visitors attaining access to the Gas Control Center andor related computer rooms and telecommunications rooms What are the current physical security policies and procedures for these secure areas How can these be strengthened or improved upon Does the current Gas Control Emergency Reaction Plan adequately address potential threats due to breaches of security Who in the Enron organization is responsible for routine daily management of security and who is responsible for longer term planning How are security issues communicated Preventative measures Early warning

to Steve and he would get it to Helen Original Message From Lord Randy SentMonday February PM ToKenagy Gary CcDonovan Bill Woods Steve Corman Shelley January Steve Bryant Mike Rahn Nick Spriggs Bernie SubjectRE Elevator Maintenance Gary Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go vernor on Car This controls the speed of the car and the car is desi gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r isk an overspeed condition We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems The inter com in this car does not work but the alarm bell does work I cant explai n why no one heard the bell We have taken the car out of service until the intercom is repaired There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the bankruptcy in December but none that should have impacted the maintenance levels of the elevators We have eliminated the x on site coverage by the Maintenance Department and returned to an on call arrangement which w e previously had until about a year ago We had to reduce the size of our s taff as did everyone else and simply do not have enough people to adequate ly staff x any longer We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on site Monday through Friday during our peak That however was when we had over people in the building During that time we had a lot of proble ms just because of the extremely heavy usage Now that we have fewer than people here the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics so we have cut back to one The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac complished on schedule by the one mechanic Most of the other high rise bui ldings in town have either one or none In the past the second mechanic was tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now While it is not required by code we have always made it an internal practi ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei r functions on a weekly basis This is generally accomplished by Security o r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours as you must recall them to the lobby to do this The inspections were not completed this past Saturday This would normally not be a significant issue as routines are i nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems Unfortunately this time it was significant This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need corrected or reviewed with our support personnel I do not know what time it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator but Security cont acted our on call person at approximately AM The on call Tech then proceeded to the building arriving at about PM Our person tried uns uccessfully to reset the elevator and when that was not possible he asked Security if Schindler was on their way It was at that point the he learne d that Schindler had not been contacted yet Security then called Schindler at pm and Schindler contacted their mechanic at pm The Sch indler tech arrived on site at pm and had the person out of the elev ator about pm It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin dler immediately in the event of an entrapment Failure to do this resulted in an extra hour before help arrived I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent rapment We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if the intercom does not work properly Security will remain responsible for these inspections since they have people here at night I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes terday and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does not happen again Elevators will occasionally break and there will occasi onally be an entrapment but hours and no ability to communicate is not a cceptable Randy Original Message From Kenagy Gary SentMonday February AM ToLord Randy CcDonovan Bill Woods Steve Corman Shelley January Steve Bryant Mike Rahn Nick SubjectElevator Maintenance Randy Yesterday Sunday the th one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in an elevator for approximately hours Apparently the alarm and the

searched for her it was hours bef ore they determined she was stuck in an elevator It then took another ho urs to repair the elevator and get her out We were advised by one of the g uards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performe d on Saturday as scheduled We also were led to believe that the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed
