<904935.1075853198686.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michelle.blaine@enron.com,2000-12-21 09:25:00,Insurance Claim under CARDSU Policy Cc fyi I am already on top of this Ken Blades and I had a conversation with Justin Williams yesterday about this ongoing saga which has been ongoing a long time Essentially heres where we are and why it is a good thing that United India has sued us in the London Court In the early part of the dispute we gave consideration to litigation vs arbitration but we could only sue UI in India which was a bad option Several months ago after lengthy settlement discussions with United India UI and reinsurers about DPCs DSU claim resulting from the first rotor problems UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration under the policy The notice was curious because UI clearly disputed both liability and quantum however the policys arbitration clause states that arbitration can only include issues of quantum Through a series of correspondence we believe UI has agreed to arbitrate liability quantum in the same proceeding and to include reinsurers in the arbitration The cut through clause in the policy enables DPC to recover directly from the reinsurers It appears however at least we speculate that UI has suddenly become uncomfortable with the anomaly that while they have served DPC a notice of arbitration the clause limits arbitration to quantum not liability Hence UIs declaratory judgment action in the London Commercial Court to determine liability Now this gives us an option we didnt have earlier litigation in the London court since they have submitted to jurisdiction or arbitration There are pros cons to both which we are discussing with Justin and Peter An interesting piece of the puzzle is that UI is now trying to realign the parties since DPC is the insured seeking recovery The reason UI wants to do this is because i it would put the burden of proof on DPC as claimant ii UI as claimant will have a very difficult time meeting its burden of proof on a dec action because they do not have all the technical information DPC has Pros of litigation The London court is less likely to permit this realignment than arbitrators who are typically more lenient in procedural matters of this type We also believe the London court will be cheaper no cost of arbitrators and quicker since there are statutory time lines UI has no incentive to resolve this expeditiously and has at every opportunity slowed the arbitration process by rejecting everything DPC proposes from the number of arbitrators to the names submitted etc Also in the London court there is a strong possibility DPC can get an advance security for attorneys fees as the defendant which is not possible in arbitration Downside of litigation It is less likely that DPC can litigate directly against the reinsurers for procedural reasons Furthermore DPC could potentially end up in two proceedings litigation to determine liability arbitration to determine quantum which could take longer and be expensive Ken Blades believes the loss adjuster stipulated to quantum in a prior meeting which would enable us to avoid that scenario Until we see the document however we cannot determine whether the stipulation is enforceable because of issues of authority etc The bottom line is now that UI has sued us in London court we have a choice we didnt have before We plan to obtain Kens document re the stipulation send a letter to UI and then see their reaction before we decide Now that weve been served it just shortens our time limit to do this Im inclined to go the litigation route but I want to see that stipulation document first and discuss with Linklaters its value either as an enforceable agreement or its strength as evidence of quantum Call me if you have questions In

Forwarded by Michelle BlaineENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Michelle Blaine AM To Ken BladesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Williams Justin justin inklaterscom ENRONRichard Sanders Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject RE United India strictly confidential and privileged I think Justin answered your question about governing law and the first arbitration hearing and I am going to find out from Atul about whether Indian law governs these policies since Indian law requires us to have an Indian fronting policy On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken I was asking Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was any law India or English requiring insurers to disclose information regarding risk to the insured so we could cite some law perhaps to compel Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report For example the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague duty of good faith fair dealing standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured Justin tells me English law in this regard consists only of precedential case law but it still could be helpful Because of the commercial risk outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines If in fact there truly is a chance of failure in these machines yet they wont share that evidence with us this is a commercial risk DPC cant afford regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration Im wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction United India did us the favor of bringing suit in London Commercial Court earlier and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirsts emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction I think it is worth considering if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justins latest correspondence I dont think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one Why dont you and Neil kick this around since you dont have enough to do already Cheers Michelle Ken Blades PM To Michelle

Williams Justin justin inklaterscom on AM To cc Heneghan Diane diane inklaterscom Subject RE United India strictly confidential and privileged Michelle I know the problem about cases and clauses running together The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law On an application of English private international law ie conflict of laws rules there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law At para of Hirsts statement he says that the contracts are impliedly subject to English law based on London as the arbitration forum Certainly my preference in terms of certainty would be English law However it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantive law and once we get UIs statement of claim we should give thought to whether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether there could be advantage in arguing Indian law I will ask Diane to add this to the to do list Justin Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday January PM

is some mentio n of legal fees being limited to subrogation issues Can you elaborate What are such issues We know what subrogation is Does this mean work to preserve the subrogation position of the insurer is allowed If Siemens is named as an additional insured insurers would have no such rights This of course would depend on their reading of the cover ie if they might say that this had nothing to do with gas commissioning We of course are supposed to have covered Siemens with a maintenance cover which would hav e protected them for design defects etc Need to figure out what Stuart is getting at We had understood that any work done to facilitate the repair would also be covered such as work on the Change Order Parts Agreement etc We are about to send out our bill and would like to do two separate bills one which would cover things which the insurer might reimburse and one which i s clearly advice to you on issues like the PPA etc Let us know ASAP so we can work up something Second there is discussion of advance payment Jim Studderts recent email said that this policy is an indemnity policy which he describes as a pay if paid approach That is EPE would have to have spent the mone y already in order to get paid by insurers rather than be paid against an estimate of cost or against a PO being issued That is in fact how most of the language is phrased but there are

direct will be in Reais the claim is dollar based and will be converted from dollars to reais at the exchange rate at the time of payment S Stromeyer to determine if IRB can pay directly to EPE in dollars Payments can be made to third parties outside of Brazil in dollars at EPEs direction S Stromeyer to check with IRB to determine if this is accepted by Central Bank Siemens Meeting Last Week in Erlangen Root Cause To prevent coking problems from occurring in the fuel nozzles Siemens increased the volume of purge water used to purge fuel oil from the burner fuel lines following a trip from premix The increased volume of purge water resulted in quenching of Row blades The quenching produced high thermomechanical forces on the blades which produced cracks One of the blade cracks eventually resulted in a blade failure A meeting is scheduled for October in London for Siemens to explain their conclusions on root cause Commercial Issues Parts will be purchased in accordance with the Spare Parts Agreement SPA with the following significant exceptions A expediting fee will be paid on turbine blades and vanes Prices are FOB port of export with Siemens listed prices The SPA discount will not apply Payment must be made prior to shipment There will be two services agreements between EPE and Siemens Ltda for Brazilian sourced services paid in Reais at the rates in Siemens Price List provided to you in Cuiaba converted to Reais using RealUS and between EPE and Siemens AG for nonBrazilian sourced services paid in US These agreements will incorporate terms from the Siemens Selling Policies Price Lists and the EPC Contract Late payments will incur interest at Advanced Payment Property damage coverage advanced payments could be made at of estimated value Advanced payment will not be made against BI coverage Typical total time for advanced payment is about days Once IRB receives funds from London underwriters typical payment time is about or so days Munich Re will require a Board Meeting to approve an advanced payment of the size being discussed If the parts costs are financed by third party it will be quicker to get Munich Re payment Could know funding date by October BI London underwriters pay on lost revenue IRB traditionally pays on turnover or lost net profit S Stromeyer and CrowfordResin personnel will discuss with IRB to try to convince them to pay on lost revenues A meeting is scheduled for November IRB will not likely allow direct payment to third parties outside of Brazil A meeting is scheduled in Houston on Tuesday October to discuss BI estimate Property Damage Duties and taxes are included in coverage FX transaction costs are not included in coverage Legal and engineering support are covered only with prior approval of appropriate justification Approval of legal is usually limited to subrogation issues A rough estimate of insurable costs was provided by EPE and discussed the estimate was qualified by footnotes and by the discussion The purpose of this estimate was to provide information to obtain advanced payment Total insurance portion of parts expediting fee repairs services taxes and less deductible was MM Total EPE portion was MM As discussed it is possible that the insurable portion may increase pending analysis of additional components We agreed that the amount to be used for advanced payment

NRONDEVELOPMENT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject RE United India strictly confidential and privileged I think Justin answered your question about governing law and the first arbitration hearing and I am going to find out from Atul about whether Indian law governs these policies since Indian law requires us to have an Indian fronting policy On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken I was asking Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was any law India or English requiring insurers to disclose information regarding risk to the insured so we could cite some law perhaps to compel Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report For example the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague duty of good faith fair dealing standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured Justin tells me English law in this regard consists only of precedential case law but it still could be helpful Because of the commercial risk outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines If in fact there truly is a chance of failure in these machines yet they wont share that evidence with us this is a commercial risk DPC cant afford regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration Im wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction United India did us the favor of bringing suit in London Commercial Court earlier and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirsts emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction I think it is worth considering if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justins latest correspondence I dont think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one Why dont you and Neil kick this around since you dont have enough to do already Cheers Michelle Ken Blades PM To Michelle

Williams Justin justin inklaterscom on AM To cc Heneghan Diane diane inklaterscom Subject RE United India strictly confidential and privileged Michelle I know the problem about cases and clauses running together The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law On an application of English private international law ie conflict of laws rules there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law At para of Hirsts statement he says that the contracts are impliedly subject to English law based on London as the arbitration forum Certainly my preference in terms of certainty would be English law However it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantive law and once we get UIs statement of claim we should give thought to whether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether there could be advantage in arguing Indian law I will ask Diane to add this to the to do list Justin Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday January PM

<9142344.1075853228216.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michelle.blaine@enron.com,2000-12-21 09:25:00,Insurance Claim under CARDSU Policy Cc fyi I am already on top of this Ken Blades and I had a conversation with Justin Williams yesterday about this ongoing saga which has been ongoing a long time Essentially heres where we are and why it is a good thing that United India has sued us in the London Court In the early part of the dispute we gave consideration to litigation vs arbitration but we could only sue UI in India which was a bad option Several months ago after lengthy settlement discussions with United India UI and reinsurers about DPCs DSU claim resulting from the first rotor problems UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration under the policy The notice was curious because UI clearly disputed both liability and quantum however the policys arbitration clause states that arbitration can only include issues of quantum Through a series of correspondence we believe UI has agreed to arbitrate liability quantum in the same proceeding and to include reinsurers in the arbitration The cut through clause in the policy enables DPC to recover directly from the reinsurers It appears however at least we speculate that UI has suddenly become uncomfortable with the anomaly that while they have served DPC a notice of arbitration the clause limits arbitration to quantum not liability Hence UIs declaratory judgment action in the London Commercial Court to determine liability Now this gives us an option we didnt have earlier litigation in the London court since they have submitted to jurisdiction or arbitration There are pros cons to both which we are discussing with Justin and Peter An interesting piece of the puzzle is that UI is now trying to realign the parties since DPC is the insured seeking recovery The reason UI wants to do this is because i it would put the burden of proof on DPC as claimant ii UI as claimant will have a very difficult time meeting its burden of proof on a dec action because they do not have all the technical information DPC has Pros of litigation The London court is less likely to permit this realignment than arbitrators who are typically more lenient in procedural matters of this type We also believe the London court will be cheaper no cost of arbitrators and quicker since there are statutory time lines UI has no incentive to resolve this expeditiously and has at every opportunity slowed the arbitration process by rejecting everything DPC proposes from the number of arbitrators to the names submitted etc Also in the London court there is a strong possibility DPC can get an advance security for attorneys fees as the defendant which is not possible in arbitration Downside of litigation It is less likely that DPC can litigate directly against the reinsurers for procedural reasons Furthermore DPC could potentially end up in two proceedings litigation to determine liability arbitration to determine quantum which could take longer and be expensive Ken Blades believes the loss adjuster stipulated to quantum in a prior meeting which would enable us to avoid that scenario Until we see the document however we cannot determine whether the stipulation is enforceable because of issues of authority etc The bottom line is now that UI has sued us in London court we have a choice we didnt have before We plan to obtain Kens document re the stipulation send a letter to UI and then see their reaction before we decide Now that weve been served it just shortens our time limit to do this Im inclined to go the litigation route but I want to see that stipulation document first and discuss with Linklaters its value either as an enforceable agreement or its strength as evidence of quantum Call me if you have questions In the meantime Ill keep you informed Michelle Forwarded by Michelle BlaineENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Robert C Williams AM To Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT
