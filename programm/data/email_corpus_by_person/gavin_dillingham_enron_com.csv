Debate Deregulation of Electricity Paul B Johnson KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News High Point Enterprise North Carolina Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Donald Ratliffe doesnt know the intimate details over the complex debate over whether to deregulate the sale of electricity to millions of customers in North Carolina But the yearold mechanic from Kernersville said he does know enough to boil the issue down to a proverbial phrase if it aint broke dont fix it Anytime theyve seemed to deregulate something it becomes a big mess Ratliffe said referring to the deregulation of fields such as the airline and telephone industries Change can be good but its not always good Answering questions recently as part of an informal survey of men and women in the Triad Ratliffe said the current monopoly system for electric service suits him When you think about what you get for your money its still a great buy he said Ratliffe was one of the people interviewed recently by the High Point Enterprise on their thoughts about whether the state should reform the billionayear electric industry Members of the Study Commission on the Future of Electric Service in NC have spent the past three years dealing with analysts lobbyists and industry representatives on how to approach the intricate issue In April the member commission approved recommendations that include deregulating the sale of electricity starting in with full implementation in The commission will resume its meetings in Raleigh Sept with the goal of coming up with legislation that could be proposed for the General Assembly session State legislators will have the final say on whether to deregulate an industry that has functioned under a monopoly system for virtually a century The response of people answering questions posed by the Enterprise was similar to the opinions expressed two years ago when eight public hearings were held across the state on electric deregulation Approximately people attended the meetings according to a report prepared for the commission Many people expressed serious concerns about restructuring without expressing a definite opinion either for or against it reported the consultant that prepared the commissions report on the information gathered at the hearings The debate over deregulation carries special significance for High Point because of the monumental level of municipal power debts The study commission hasnt come up with a specific plan to address the billion debt The city of High Point has municipal power debts of approximately million the fourthhighest amount among the towns and cities in the state that run their own electric distribution systems Several proposals considered by the commission would compel the cities and towns to sell their power distribution systems with the revenue going toward debt relief For Avis Murphy of High Point the topic of deregulation prompts her to envision potential benefits and pitfalls The yearold retail manager said having more options to pick her familys power provider should lead to better service and prices because of competition But she can also see people being taken advantage of if the government doesnt have some oversight to prevent price gouging Murphy suggested having what would amount to a social safety net if deregulation takes place such as putting a cap on how much rates can go up during a certain period of time among companies providing service Many men and women interviewed by the Enterprise said they didnt want a deregulated electric industry to become a daytoday telemarketing and sales pitch drudgery Lou Damron of High Point and her friend enjoying lunch rolled their eyes when asked if they would mind getting telemarketing calls from power companies as they do now from telecommunication companies Whenever they do something like this it always gets more complicated said yearold retiree I like the way it is now I dont have to worry about it Retiree Johnnie Alexander of High Point said that she wouldnt want deregulation to interfere with her ability to have an equalized payment plan which allows her to keep her payments the same through the year I like the way it is now the yearold woman said Some people expressed an interest in deregulation if it would lead to better prices Competition could be an improvement because companies would offer lower rates to lure customers said yearold retiree John Cochran of High Point Also a competitive market may compel more companies to build new power plants to meet the demand of a growing base of customers Cochran said It always a better when theres an open marketplace said yearold financial specialist Phillip Carter of Advance who works in High Point Im a firm believer in capitalism and the free market One challenge that officials face in reforming the electric industry is the wide disparity in the customer base and amount of electricity used per customer in North Carolina Of the approximately million electric customers in the state percent are residential customers About percent are commercial customers meaning owners of shopping centers and office buildings with about percent industrial customers such as manufacturers However the vast majority of electricity is used by the least number of customers For example for Carolina Power Light Co less than percent of its customers use percent of the power that the utility generates Put another way of CPLs million customers the top virtually all industries use percent of the utilitys energy CPL reports The disparity in the scope of customers and in how much electricity various types of customers use make it challenging to come up with a competitive rate structure where all types of customers benefit said Charles Harman a Duke University mechanical engineering professor Whats going to happen with deregulation is that people with market clout are going to be able to negotiate better deals than people without market clout said Harman who has an expertise in electric industry issues That means ordinary people may find that deregulation wont have any noticeable effect on what they pay each month to a utility Harman said

Phillips is a former general manager of the Department of Water and Power Los Angeles Times Home Edition M Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN DIEGO What a difference four years make for Department of Water and Power customers With passage of electricity deregulation in an uncompetitive DWP clung to life Unable to pay down its billionplus powergeneration debt and saddled with high rates for large business customers it faced the prospect of a death spiral if it entered a deregulated marketplace Commercial customers threatened to flee to lowercost energy suppliers while residential customers could be forced to pay large fixed costs As a result the DWP shunned deregulation Yet by this summer as San Diego Gas Electrics ratepayers the first to be exposed to market forces faced a doubling even tripling of their electric bills the DWPs million customers basked in low rates and a large power surplus More remarkable the DWP is even being touted today as a model for proposed municipal utilities in cities hardhit by escalating electricityrate increases What accounts for this startling turnaround While current management deserves credit the DWPs position also is a product of longerterm policy and investment decisions Since its creation nearly years ago the department has made lowcost waterandpower reliability its policy cornerstone Ezra F Scattergood founder of the DWPs power system relentlessly pursued cheap hydroelectric powernearly all from Hoover Damand by LA boasted the nations lowest power rates Yet with postwar population and industrial growth new and more expensive ways had to be found to meet burgeoning demand Starting in the s stringent state airquality regulations which eliminated fossilfuelfired plants in California created the need for large expensive power stations in Utah and Arizona The DWPs new power came from four large steamgenerating plants in the LA Basin partnerships in outofstate coalfired and nuclear plants an Intertie connection to the energyrich Pacific Northwest and the peakload Castaic pump storage facility As a result the DWP accumulated nearly dependable megawatts of generation well above this summers peak demand of megawatts For the DWP to have entered the deregulated marketplace early on it needed to pay off the large debt created by its investments in distant energy sources and offer competitive rates for large business customers Under deregulation debt relief came at the cost of reduced reliability Investorowned utilities such as Southern California Edison could pay off debts like the San Onofre nuclear power plant with a transitional surcharge added to ratepayers bills But participating utilities were forced to sell their power plants so that transmission and generation lay in separate hands The DWPs decision to pass on deregulations guarantee of debt relief was risky While municipal utilities were given the option of fully entering the marketplace in there was little evidence that the DWP could unilaterally pay off its huge debt since its revenue in part was used to fund other projects like Mayor Richard Riordans police buildup While the citys elected officials approved residential rates below privateutility charges they balked at lowering rates for large businesses that were higher than for rival utilities Because big businesses would be the first to enter the deregulated marketplace many believed the DWP would have to be privatized to be competitive Yet since the debt of the uncompetitive DWP has been halved and the agency plans to be debtfree within two years It now sells surplus power to other utilities accelerating debt payoff Adding megawatts of capacity over the past several years by restarting mothballed plants the DWP in its justapproved year billion capital program will provide megawatts of new generating power As the states investorowned utilities and their ratepayers face a doubling or more of energy prices until new plants come on line the department plans to offer a rate reduction by Armed with low rates and a large surplus it is vigorously promoting alternativeenergy sources The departments current management deserves some credit for the turnaround DWP general manager David Freeman has adroitly used that deregulated market for surplus sales and debt relief Forging an alliance with the departments largest labor union Freeman has wrung concessions from a laborfriendly City Council Freeman also engineered the sale of the DWPs share of a poorly performing plantthe Mohave facilitywhile planning upgrades of cleaner plants in the LA Basin that will significantly add to the departments energy reserves By continuing to say no to deregulation the DWP can ensure Los Angeles future economic competitiveness It and other public utilities are the states lowestcost providers of electricity They possess the reserves needed to provide ultrahigh reliability to an electricitydependent economy Although they do not return profits to shareholders public utilities can be operated as efficiently as their private counterparts if freed from political interference Until the states energy crisis is fixed the high cost of electricity and the associated uncertainty in deregulated regions will result in business and job losses to oases of lowcost reliable public power such as Los Angeles Pasadena Glendale Burbank Anaheim Azusa Vernon Riverside Colton and Sacramento The DWPs stunning success in a deregulated market has caught the attention of San Diego where ratepayers have suffered the most and San Francisco In San Diego suburban San Marcos decided to create a municipal utility two weeks ago and Chula Vista is considering one A local congressman has urged voters to create a countywide municipalutility district using the initiative Another more conservative congressman has suggested that local governments build and operate gasturbine power plants at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station to lower electricity prices and meet demand A similar grassroots movements for energy independence via municipal ownership is afoot in the Bay Area which faces the deregulated marketplace in Californias illconceived experiment with deregulation has turned the oncestaid utility world upside down in the process severely blurring the lines between private and public Under the law investorowned utilities received massive state and ratepayer subsidies to pay off past debts Today these same utilities are petitioning state officials for subsidized rate relief Yet LAs Department of Water and Power and other municipal utilities have not received one cent of state assistance for debt relief or rate stabilization By staying the course of reliability and forsaking deregulation the DWP furnishes a valuable lesson in the tangible benefits of public ownership GRAPHICDRAWING no caption WES BAUSMITH Los Angeles Times

electric bills VANESSA HUA San Francisco Examiner The price cap on San Diegos skyrocketing electricity rates mandated by state regulators Thursday is only a stopgap solution to underlying flaws in energy deregulation problems that could plague PGE customers in the future consumer groups and industry watchers say The California Public Utilities Commission voted to cap electric rates at cents per kilowatt hour They had soared as high as cents per kilowatt hour this summer The commission also agreed to investigate whether San Diego Gas Electric has been paying too much for the power it supplies to its customers The actions affirming legislation signed Wednesday by Gov Davis will reduce the average customers electric bill to a month from the current SDGE which serves San Diego County and southern Orange County was the first utility in the state to buy power on the open market and the first to pass soaring wholesale power costs to consumers Now SDGE will be able to charge customers far less than it pays for energy in highuse months The company projects that the shortfall between what it has to pay for power and what it can charge rate payers could reach million by Area rate payers may be asked to make up the difference but just how that might be done has yet to be determined pending the outcome of the PUC investigation Likewise PGE which said it has run about billion in fuel expenses wants to pass it on to consumers with an extra charge in future power bills The San Franciscobased utility said that if SDGE is allowed to pass its increased costs to consumers then it plans to seek the same treatment from the PUC But for now because of the states electric restructuring law PGEs rates will remain frozen until no later than March San Diegos energy woes stem in part from the high demand for electricity in a booming economy The new energy suppliers and generators that were supposed to foster competition and lower prices just havent materialized under deregulation analysts said Now the price cap on retail prices lower than wholesale prices on the power exchange will further discourage new entrants Its a question of who would be crazy enough to come The marketplace is too risky said George Spencer editor of Restructuring Today a Washington DCbased newsletter about deregulation Putting on a cap is a BandAid not getting to the root of the problem The rate cap defers payments to the utilities creating further market uncertainty Any kind of rate cap means that in the future SDGE has to get it back Its like a big IOU But Im not quite sure how its going to work out said Jamey Gessaman marketing program manager for Wattage Monitor which assists consumers in finding alternative electricity suppliers Truckeebased TenderLand Power Company which aims to generate and sell electricity from renewable resources differentiates itself from SDGE making clear that its prices cents per kilowatt hour is not a deferred payment plan Their customers wont have to pay more later to make up for the shortfall a spokeswoman said Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego who authored the price cap legislation said that measures were a necessary first action in solving electricity crisis over the long term The most important thing to do was to stop bleeding in San Diego she said Consumer advocates slammed electricity deregulation as a legislative failure now punishing consumers This is botched legislation There have been so many screwups in the way it was set up and administered said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego Gov Davis defended deregulation Thursday by calling it an experiment that will work if everybody acts responsibly The electrical generators that have bought up the facilities that exist in California are now selling power back to us at between five and eight times what it used to cost us he said Utilities who are now out of the generation business are basically just in the distribution business and consumers everybody has to accept their role and accept their share of the shortterm pain to make this program work In addition to the rate cap Davis also signed a bill Wednesday that would speed up the approval process for new power plants That could ease the soaring demand for electricity However the governor put off action on a third bill also passed with much fanfare by the Legislature that could provide up to million in state money to cov er any future San Diego power debts While Gov Davis said his decision on that measure could wait until later this month the timing increased speculation that he may veto the plan Some critics have argued that pledging public money to cover private power costs could set a precedent leading to a far greater drain on taxpayers in the future The PUC was scheduled to hold a hearing in San Diego on Friday to explore the cause of high summer wholesale prices Examiner news services contributed to this report

cap for San Diego David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Amid growing confusion over Californias energy future state regulators yesterday ducked the politically volatile question of whether utilities such as PGE can sock customers with billions of dollars in extra electricity charges The Public Utilities Commission did approve a rate cap for San Diego electricity customers But frustrated commissioners hinted they may kick the matter of who pays for utilities costs back to the state Legislature which had been hoping the PUC would solve the thorny question For his part Gov Gray Davis suggested yesterday that the issue should stay with the PUC Everyone is passing the buck said Mike Boyd president of Californians for Renewable Energy a Sunnyvale nonprofit group The Legislature doesnt want to touch it The PUC doesnt want to touch it Its a hot potato And the stakes are very high As The Chronicle reported yesterday Pacific Gas and Electric Co hopes to hit its customers with all the costs it will accrue under a current rate freeze as much as billion when the utilitys rates are deregulated in early For its part San Diego Gas Electric is estimating that its costs could run as high as million and it too wants ratepayers to shoulder the full burden Boyd said California lawmakers and energy regulators ultimately may be forced to call on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to weigh in on the matter RELUCTANCE TO PLAY REFEREE However the commissions chairman James Hoecker said in a telephone interview from Washington DC that federal authorities would be reluctant to play referee The recovery of costs could arguably be an issue for us he said But were not in the habit of telling states what their laws mean Thats something state officials themselves are still grappling with Amid confusion over whether they even have jurisdiction over such an issue the PUC commissioners said their approval of the rate cap in San Diego is unrelated to whether utilities should be compensated for outofpocket expenses The rate cap as mandated in a bill passed by lawmakers last week required the blessing of the commission to take effect LAW FUZZY ON COMPENSATION The governor signed the bill into law on Wednesday However the law is fuzzy about whether the local utility should be compensated for expenses incurred as a result of the rate cap At issue is the difference between what utilities must pay for power in the turbulent wholesale energy market and the amount they can charge ratepayers Californias electricity deregulation bill froze power rates statewide to stabilize the industry during a transition to a free market arena San Diego was the first city to face the full impact of deregulation when its rate freeze was lifted last year Average power bills subsequently doubled sparking outrage and protests among ratepayers The governor has accused power generators of manipulating prices and gouging consumers State and federal authorities are investigating such charges By imposing a rate cap yesterday the PUC effectively brought electricity deregulation to a halt as lawmakers and regulators struggle to fix the current system Regulation is coming back because it has to said Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group RATE CAP RETROACTIVE In line with the new law the PUC capped San Diego power rates for residential customers and small businesses at cents per kilowatt hour retroactive to June This means average monthly power bills will be about The commission also opened an investigation into the prudence and reasonableness of San Diego Gas Electrics decision not to secure longterm wholesale energy contracts Instead the utility exposed its customers to daily swings in energy prices Our basic obligation is to assure the people of California that the rates they pay for energy are just and fair said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood However he stressed that yesterdays PUC action did not address the question of whether utilities should be compensated for deregulationrelated expenses and said the matter should be taken up at a later date We are acting too much in haste agreed Richard Bilas a Republican appointee who seldom sees eyetoeye with Democratic appointee Wood on PUC decisions The most the commission should do is make a recommendation to the Legislature Bilas said For his part the governor yesterday moderated the aggressively proconsumer stance he has taken in response to the states energy woes Asked whether utilities should be able to place a surcharge on future bills to recover costs related to deregulation Davis adopted a more conciliatory tone I do believe utilities should not be left holding the bag for any problems associated with the law if they have acted responsibly he said PGE officials told The Chronicle on Wednesday that the utility is now about billion in the hole as a result of its rate freeze and that this amount is rising by nearly million a month Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego one of the authors of the ratecap legislation said that while the question of who should tackle the surcharge issue remains up in the air a likely outcome is that both the utilities and ratepayers will end up shouldering some costs In the end she said consumers are likely to pay some portion of this PHOTO Caption Gov Gray Davis said the issue of passing on costs shouldstay with the state PUC

municipal utility Sept Public Pow er Weekly Frustrated by the high electricity rates charged this summer by San Diego G as Electric Co the city of San Marcos Calif has voted to form a municip al electric utility and is considering signing up with Enron And the Board of Supervisors of San Diego County is expected to meet tomorrow Sept to discuss the feasibility of the county becoming a public power provider Last month the San Marcos City Council voted in favor of creating a cityowned utility Now former mayor Lee Thibadeau is urging the city to b uy its power from Houstonbased Enron The city could save an estimated million a year in wholesale power costs if it bought electricity from Enron he told Public Power Weekly Other cities served by SDGE might want to follow suit he said Thibadeau said he had discussed with Enron a deal under which the energy giant would sell electricity at about cents per kWh That compares to about cents per kWh that is currently charged by SDGE a unit of Semp ra Energy Last month the municipal utility in Roseville Calif approved a million contract to buy power from Enron Power Marketing over the next five years Roseville will pay cents per kWh See Public Power Weekly Aug page Earlier this month Bill Horn a member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors called for the creation of a public power district San Diego County which is the second largest county in the state faces economic disaster because of outofcontrol electricity rates he said Horn said he and the boards chairwoman Dianne Jacob will ask the supervisors on Se pt to approve the hiring of a consultant to study the idea of creating a countywide utility Horn said his goal is to have the public power utility operating by next summer His idea is to find cheaper wholesale power only not to take over SDGEs wires I am assuming we can work with SDGE he said I dont want to take over lines or become a power generator Residents of the San Diego area have been hit with surging power costs this summer as a result of SDGEs entry into freemarket electricity Their bills have doubled and even tripled compared to last years prices Rates have been getting more and more out of hand said Thibadeau San Marcos a city of about miles north of San Diego has been interested in creating a municipal electric utility for years said City Manager Rick Gittings Weve been looking at this for almost a decad e on and off he said The City Council had not brought the issue to a vote because it was fairly well satisfied with the electric service provided by SDGE he said However recent developments have certainly stimulated a different opinion Gittings said Within the next two months the city expects to put out a request for proposals for a consultant to advise it on the road to municipalization Gittings said Thibadeau who was mayor of San Marcos in the mids and early s is running for a seat on the City Council in the November election He is urgi ng city officials to move as fast as they can to find a new supplier The difference between SDGEs residential rates as of late August and the cost of buying power from an alternative supplier such as Enron amounts to a day he said Other cities in California have kept electric rates low by forming municipa l utilities he noted In Anaheim residents are paying about cents a kWh or less than half what San Marcos residents are paying SDGE he said Thats what a municipal utility can do Thibadeau said SDGE has said that it does not want to sell its distribution system within San Marcos and has urged the City Council to reject the idea of operating i ts own utility The city would have to pay SDGE fair market value for our facilities and that would cost millions and millions of dollars said SDGE representative Carol Dorman You would also have to hire between an d employees to design and maintain the system But Thibadeau said the city would not have to buy the investorowned utilit y s distribution system in order to reap savings for its residents He would like to see the city buy the system eventually but for now the city could simply shop for electricity and pass the savings on he said SDGE would b e owed a fee for its transmission and distribution expenses but residents would save on the cost of bulk power he said As a municipal utility San Marcos also will be eligible for a share of lowcost federal hydro power which currently is selling for cents a kWh he said And the city could require all new utility easements to be dedicated to the cityowned utility rather than to SDGE Thibadeau said This would gradual ly reduce the transmission and distribution costs being charged by the private utility he said Earlier this month the California Assembly passed a bill to reduce wholesa le electricity rates of SDGE customers to about cents a kWh The payment ceiling would last until with the utility footing the bill for the remaining costs But eventually those costs plus interest would become du e said Thibadeau What have we done he asked Just spread out th e problem The uproar over electric rates in the San Diego area has drawn attention fr om the federal government The US House Subcommittee on Energy and Power wil l hold a hearing today Sept in San Diego on electricity deregulation Tomorrow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a hearing to investigate soaring wholesale electricity prices in the region

process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San

what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for

Debate Deregulation of Electricity Paul B Johnson KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News High Point Enterprise North Carolina Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Donald Ratliffe doesnt know the intimate details over the complex debate over whether to deregulate the sale of electricity to millions of customers in North Carolina But the yearold mechanic from Kernersville said he does know enough to boil the issue down to a proverbial phrase if it aint broke dont fix it Anytime theyve seemed to deregulate something it becomes a big mess Ratliffe said referring to the deregulation of fields such as the airline and telephone industries Change can be good but its not always good Answering questions recently as part of an informal survey of men and women in the Triad Ratliffe said the current monopoly system for electric service suits him When you think about what you get for your money its still a great buy he said Ratliffe was one of the people interviewed recently by the High Point Enterprise on their thoughts about whether the state should reform the billionayear electric industry Members of the Study Commission on the Future of Electric Service in NC have spent the past three years dealing with analysts lobbyists and industry representatives on how to approach the intricate issue In April the member commission approved recommendations that include deregulating the sale of electricity starting in with full implementation in The commission will resume its meetings in Raleigh Sept with the goal of coming up with legislation that could be proposed for the General Assembly session State legislators will have the final say on whether to deregulate an industry that has functioned under a monopoly system for virtually a century The response of people answering questions posed by the Enterprise was similar to the opinions expressed two years ago when eight public hearings were held across the state on electric deregulation Approximately people attended the meetings according to a report prepared for the commission Many people expressed serious concerns about restructuring without expressing a definite opinion either for or against it reported the consultant that prepared the commissions report on the information gathered at the hearings The debate over deregulation carries special significance for High Point because of the monumental level of municipal power debts The study commission hasnt come up with a specific plan to address the billion debt The city of High Point has municipal power debts of approximately million the fourthhighest amount among the towns and cities in the state that run their own electric distribution systems Several proposals considered by the commission would compel the cities and towns to sell their power distribution systems with the revenue going toward debt relief For Avis Murphy of High Point the topic of deregulation prompts her to envision potential benefits and pitfalls The yearold retail manager said having more options to pick her familys power provider should lead to better service and prices because of competition But she can also see people being taken advantage of if the government doesnt have some oversight to prevent price gouging Murphy suggested having what would amount to a social safety net if deregulation takes place such as putting a cap on how much rates can go up during a certain period of time among companies providing service Many men and women interviewed by the Enterprise said they didnt want a deregulated electric industry to become a daytoday telemarketing and sales pitch drudgery Lou Damron of High Point and her friend enjoying lunch rolled their eyes when asked if they would mind getting telemarketing calls from power companies as they do now from telecommunication companies Whenever they do something like this it always gets more complicated said yearold retiree I like the way it is now I dont have to worry about it Retiree Johnnie Alexander of High Point said that she wouldnt want deregulation to interfere with her ability to have an equalized payment plan which allows her to keep her payments the same through the year I like the way it is now the yearold woman said Some people expressed an interest in deregulation if it would lead to better prices Competition could be an improvement because companies would offer lower rates to lure customers said yearold retiree John Cochran of High Point Also a competitive market may compel more companies to build new power plants to meet the demand of a growing base of customers Cochran said It always a better when theres an open marketplace said yearold financial specialist Phillip Carter of Advance who works in High Point Im a firm believer in capitalism and the free market One challenge that officials face in reforming the electric industry is the wide disparity in the customer base and amount of electricity used per customer in North Carolina Of the approximately million electric customers in the state percent are residential customers About percent are commercial customers meaning owners of shopping centers and office buildings with about percent industrial customers such as manufacturers However the vast majority of electricity is used by the least number of customers For example for Carolina Power Light Co less than percent of its customers use percent of the power that the utility generates Put another way of CPLs million customers the top virtually all industries use percent of the utilitys energy CPL reports The disparity in the scope of customers and in how much electricity various types of customers use make it challenging to come up with a competitive rate structure where all types of customers benefit said Charles Harman a Duke University mechanical engineering professor Whats going to happen with deregulation is that people with market clout are going to be able to negotiate better deals than people without market clout said Harman who has an expertise in electric industry issues That means ordinary people may find that deregulation wont have any noticeable effect on what they pay each month to a utility Harman said

Market Steven P Erie Robert V Phillips Steven P Erie is director of UC San Diegos urban studies and planning program and a senior consultant to the LA County Economic Development Corporation Robert V Phillips is a former general manager of the Department of Water and Power Los Angeles Times Home Edition M Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN DIEGO What a difference four years make for Department of Water and Power customers With passage of electricity deregulation in an uncompetitive DWP clung to life Unable to pay down its billionplus powergeneration debt and saddled with high rates for large business customers it faced the prospect of a death spiral if it entered a deregulated marketplace Commercial customers threatened to flee to lowercost energy suppliers while residential customers could be forced to pay large fixed costs As a result the DWP shunned deregulation Yet by this summer as San Diego Gas Electrics ratepayers the first to be exposed to market forces faced a doubling even tripling of their electric bills the DWPs million customers basked in low rates and a large power surplus More remarkable the DWP is even being touted today as a model for proposed municipal utilities in cities hardhit by escalating electricityrate increases What accounts for this startling turnaround While current management deserves credit the DWPs position also is a product of longerterm policy and investment decisions Since its creation nearly years ago the department has made lowcost waterandpower reliability its policy cornerstone Ezra F Scattergood founder of the DWPs power system relentlessly pursued cheap hydroelectric powernearly all from Hoover Damand by LA boasted the nations lowest power rates Yet with postwar population and industrial growth new and more expensive ways had to be found to meet burgeoning demand Starting in the s stringent state airquality regulations which eliminated fossilfuelfired plants in California created the need for large expensive power stations in Utah and Arizona The DWPs new power came from four large steamgenerating plants in the LA Basin partnerships in outofstate coalfired and nuclear plants an Intertie connection to the energyrich Pacific Northwest and the peakload Castaic pump storage facility As a result the DWP accumulated nearly dependable megawatts of generation well above this summers peak demand of megawatts For the DWP to have entered the deregulated marketplace early on it needed to pay off the large debt created by its investments in distant energy sources and offer competitive rates for large business customers Under deregulation debt relief came at the cost of reduced reliability Investorowned utilities such as Southern California Edison could pay off debts like the San Onofre nuclear power plant with a transitional surcharge added to ratepayers bills But participating utilities were forced to sell their power plants so that transmission and generation lay in separate hands The DWPs decision to pass on deregulations guarantee of debt relief was risky While municipal utilities were given the option of fully entering the marketplace in there was little evidence that the DWP could unilaterally pay off its huge debt since its revenue in part was used to fund other projects like Mayor Richard Riordans police buildup While the citys elected officials approved residential rates below privateutility charges they balked at lowering rates for large businesses that were higher than for rival utilities Because big businesses would be the first to enter the deregulated marketplace many believed the DWP would have to be privatized to be competitive Yet since the debt of the uncompetitive DWP has been halved and the agency plans to be debtfree within two years It now sells surplus power to other utilities accelerating debt payoff Adding megawatts of capacity over the past several years by restarting mothballed plants the DWP in its justapproved year billion capital program will provide megawatts of new generating power As the states investorowned utilities and their ratepayers face a doubling or more of energy prices until new plants come on line the department plans to offer a rate reduction by Armed with low rates and a large surplus it is vigorously promoting alternativeenergy sources The departments current management deserves some credit for the turnaround DWP general manager David Freeman has adroitly used that deregulated market for surplus sales and debt relief Forging an alliance with the departments largest labor union Freeman has wrung concessions from a laborfriendly City Council Freeman also engineered the sale of the DWPs share of a poorly performing plantthe Mohave facilitywhile planning upgrades of cleaner plants in the LA Basin that will significantly add to the departments energy reserves By continuing to say no to deregulation the DWP can ensure Los Angeles future economic competitiveness It and other public utilities are the states lowestcost providers of electricity They possess the reserves needed to provide ultrahigh reliability to an electricitydependent economy Although they do not return profits to shareholders public utilities can be operated as efficiently as their private counterparts if freed from political interference Until the states energy crisis is fixed the high cost of electricity and the associated uncertainty in deregulated regions will result in business and job losses to oases of lowcost reliable public power such as Los Angeles Pasadena Glendale Burbank Anaheim Azusa Vernon Riverside Colton and Sacramento The DWPs stunning success in a deregulated market has caught the attention of San Diego where ratepayers have suffered the most and San Francisco In San Diego suburban San Marcos decided to create a municipal utility two weeks ago and Chula Vista is considering one A local congressman has urged voters to create a countywide municipalutility district using the initiative Another more conservative congressman has suggested that local governments build and operate gasturbine power plants at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station to lower electricity prices and meet demand A similar grassroots movements for energy independence via municipal ownership is afoot in the Bay Area which faces the deregulated marketplace in Californias illconceived experiment with deregulation has turned the oncestaid utility world upside down in the process severely blurring the lines between private and public Under the law investorowned utilities received massive state and ratepayer subsidies to pay off past debts Today these same utilities are petitioning state officials for subsidized rate relief Yet LAs Department of Water and Power and other municipal utilities have not received one cent of state assistance for debt relief or rate stabilization By staying the course of reliability and forsaking deregulation the DWP furnishes a valuable lesson in the tangible benefits of public ownership GRAPHICDRAWING no caption WES BAUSMITH Los Angeles Times

electric bills VANESSA HUA San Francisco Examiner The price cap on San Diegos skyrocketing electricity rates mandated by state regulators Thursday is only a stopgap solution to underlying flaws in energy deregulation problems that could plague PGE customers in the future consumer groups and industry watchers say The California Public Utilities Commission voted to cap electric rates at cents per kilowatt hour They had soared as high as cents per kilowatt hour this summer The commission also agreed to investigate whether San Diego Gas Electric has been paying too much for the power it supplies to its customers The actions affirming legislation signed Wednesday by Gov Davis will reduce the average customers electric bill to a month from the current SDGE which serves San Diego County and southern Orange County was the first utility in the state to buy power on the open market and the first to pass soaring wholesale power costs to consumers Now SDGE will be able to charge customers far less than it pays for energy in highuse months The company projects that the shortfall between what it has to pay for power and what it can charge rate payers could reach million by Area rate payers may be asked to make up the difference but just how that might be done has yet to be determined pending the outcome of the PUC investigation Likewise PGE which said it has run about billion in fuel expenses wants to pass it on to consumers with an extra charge in future power bills The San Franciscobased utility said that if SDGE is allowed to pass its increased costs to consumers then it plans to seek the same treatment from the PUC But for now because of the states electric restructuring law PGEs rates will remain frozen until no later than March San Diegos energy woes stem in part from the high demand for electricity in a booming economy The new energy suppliers and generators that were supposed to foster competition and lower prices just havent materialized under deregulation analysts said Now the price cap on retail prices lower than wholesale prices on the power exchange will further discourage new entrants Its a question of who would be crazy enough to come The marketplace is too risky said George Spencer editor of Restructuring Today a Washington DCbased newsletter about deregulation Putting on a cap is a BandAid not getting to the root of the problem The rate cap defers payments to the utilities creating further market uncertainty Any kind of rate cap means that in the future SDGE has to get it back Its like a big IOU But Im not quite sure how its going to work out said Jamey Gessaman marketing program manager for Wattage Monitor which assists consumers in finding alternative electricity suppliers Truckeebased TenderLand Power Company which aims to generate and sell electricity from renewable resources differentiates itself from SDGE making clear that its prices cents per kilowatt hour is not a deferred payment plan Their customers wont have to pay more later to make up for the shortfall a spokeswoman said Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego who authored the price cap legislation said that measures were a necessary first action in solving electricity crisis over the long term The most important thing to do was to stop bleeding in San Diego she said Consumer advocates slammed electricity deregulation as a legislative failure now punishing consumers This is botched legislation There have been so many screwups in the way it was set up and administered said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego Gov Davis defended deregulation Thursday by calling it an experiment that will work if everybody acts responsibly The electrical generators that have bought up the facilities that exist in California are now selling power back to us at between five and eight times what it used to cost us he said Utilities who are now out of the generation business are basically just in the distribution business and consumers everybody has to accept their role and accept their share of the shortterm pain to make this program work In addition to the rate cap Davis also signed a bill Wednesday that would speed up the approval process for new power plants That could ease the soaring demand for electricity However the governor put off action on a third bill also passed with much fanfare by the Legislature that could provide up to million in state money to cov er any future San Diego power debts While Gov Davis said his decision on that measure could wait until later this month the timing increased speculation that he may veto the plan Some critics have argued that pledging public money to cover private power costs could set a precedent leading to a far greater drain on taxpayers in the future The PUC was scheduled to hold a hearing in San Diego on Friday to explore the cause of high summer wholesale prices Examiner news services contributed to this report

cap for San Diego David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Amid growing confusion over Californias energy future state regulators yesterday ducked the politically volatile question of whether utilities such as PGE can sock customers with billions of dollars in extra electricity charges The Public Utilities Commission did approve a rate cap for San Diego electricity customers But frustrated commissioners hinted they may kick the matter of who pays for utilities costs back to the state Legislature which had been hoping the PUC would solve the thorny question For his part Gov Gray Davis suggested yesterday that the issue should stay with the PUC Everyone is passing the buck said Mike Boyd president of Californians for Renewable Energy a Sunnyvale nonprofit group The Legislature doesnt want to touch it The PUC doesnt want to touch it Its a hot potato And the stakes are very high As The Chronicle reported yesterday Pacific Gas and Electric Co hopes to hit its customers with all the costs it will accrue under a current rate freeze as much as billion when the utilitys rates are deregulated in early For its part San Diego Gas Electric is estimating that its costs could run as high as million and it too wants ratepayers to shoulder the full burden Boyd said California lawmakers and energy regulators ultimately may be forced to call on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to weigh in on the matter RELUCTANCE TO PLAY REFEREE However the commissions chairman James Hoecker said in a telephone interview from Washington DC that federal authorities would be reluctant to play referee The recovery of costs could arguably be an issue for us he said But were not in the habit of telling states what their laws mean Thats something state officials themselves are still grappling with Amid confusion over whether they even have jurisdiction over such an issue the PUC commissioners said their approval of the rate cap in San Diego is unrelated to whether utilities should be compensated for outofpocket expenses The rate cap as mandated in a bill passed by lawmakers last week required the blessing of the commission to take effect LAW FUZZY ON COMPENSATION The governor signed the bill into law on Wednesday However the law is fuzzy about whether the local utility should be compensated for expenses incurred as a result of the rate cap At issue is the difference between what utilities must pay for power in the turbulent wholesale energy market and the amount they can charge ratepayers Californias electricity deregulation bill froze power rates statewide to stabilize the industry during a transition to a free market arena San Diego was the first city to face the full impact of deregulation when its rate freeze was lifted last year Average power bills subsequently doubled sparking outrage and protests among ratepayers The governor has accused power generators of manipulating prices and gouging consumers State and federal authorities are investigating such charges By imposing a rate cap yesterday the PUC effectively brought electricity deregulation to a halt as lawmakers and regulators struggle to fix the current system Regulation is coming back because it has to said Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group RATE CAP RETROACTIVE In line with the new law the PUC capped San Diego power rates for residential customers and small businesses at cents per kilowatt hour retroactive to June This means average monthly power bills will be about The commission also opened an investigation into the prudence and reasonableness of San Diego Gas Electrics decision not to secure longterm wholesale energy contracts Instead the utility exposed its customers to daily swings in energy prices Our basic obligation is to assure the people of California that the rates they pay for energy are just and fair said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood However he stressed that yesterdays PUC action did not address the question of whether utilities should be compensated for deregulationrelated expenses and said the matter should be taken up at a later date We are acting too much in haste agreed Richard Bilas a Republican appointee who seldom sees eyetoeye with Democratic appointee Wood on PUC decisions The most the commission should do is make a recommendation to the Legislature Bilas said For his part the governor yesterday moderated the aggressively proconsumer stance he has taken in response to the states energy woes Asked whether utilities should be able to place a surcharge on future bills to recover costs related to deregulation Davis adopted a more conciliatory tone I do believe utilities should not be left holding the bag for any problems associated with the law if they have acted responsibly he said PGE officials told The Chronicle on Wednesday that the utility is now about billion in the hole as a result of its rate freeze and that this amount is rising by nearly million a month Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego one of the authors of the ratecap legislation said that while the question of who should tackle the surcharge issue remains up in the air a likely outcome is that both the utilities and ratepayers will end up shouldering some costs In the end she said consumers are likely to pay some portion of this PHOTO

municipal utility Sept Public Pow er Weekly Frustrated by the high electricity rates charged this summer by San Diego G as Electric Co the city of San Marcos Calif has voted to form a municip al electric utility and is considering signing up with Enron And the Board of Supervisors of San Diego County is expected to meet tomorrow Sept to discuss the feasibility of the county becoming a public power provider Last month the San Marcos City Council voted in favor of creating a cityowned utility Now former mayor Lee Thibadeau is urging the city to b uy its power from Houstonbased Enron The city could save an estimated million a year in wholesale power costs if it bought electricity from Enron he told Public Power Weekly Other cities served by SDGE might want to follow suit he said Thibadeau said he had discussed with Enron a deal under which the energy giant would sell electricity at about cents per kWh That compares to about cents per kWh that is currently charged by SDGE a unit of Semp ra Energy Last month the municipal utility in Roseville Calif approved a million contract to buy power from Enron Power Marketing over the next five years Roseville will pay cents per kWh See Public Power Weekly Aug page Earlier this month Bill Horn a member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors called for the creation of a public power district San Diego County which is the second largest county in the state faces economic disaster because of outofcontrol electricity rates he said Horn said he and the boards chairwoman Dianne Jacob will ask the supervisors on Se pt to approve the hiring of a consultant to study the idea of creating a countywide utility Horn said his goal is to have the public power utility operating by next summer His idea is to find cheaper wholesale power only not to take over SDGEs wires I am assuming we can work with SDGE he said I dont want to take over lines or become a power generator Residents of the San Diego area have been hit with surging power costs this summer as a result of SDGEs entry into freemarket electricity Their bills have doubled and even tripled compared to last years prices Rates have been getting more and more out of hand said Thibadeau San Marcos a city of about miles north of San Diego has been interested in creating a municipal electric utility for years said City Manager Rick Gittings Weve been looking at this for almost a decad e on and off he said The City Council had not brought the issue to a vote because it was fairly well satisfied with the electric service provided by SDGE he said However recent developments have certainly stimulated a different opinion Gittings said Within the next two months the city expects to put out a request for proposals for a consultant to advise it on the road to municipalization Gittings said Thibadeau who was mayor of San Marcos in the mids and early s is running for a seat on the City Council in the November election He is urgi ng city officials to move as fast as they can to find a new supplier The difference between SDGEs residential rates as of late August and the cost of buying power from an alternative supplier such as Enron amounts to a day he said Other cities in California have kept electric rates low by forming municipa l utilities he noted In Anaheim residents are paying about cents a kWh or less than half what San Marcos residents are paying SDGE he said Thats what a municipal utility can do Thibadeau said SDGE has said that it does not want to sell its distribution system within San Marcos and has urged the City Council to reject the idea of operating i ts own utility The city would have to pay SDGE fair market value for our facilities and that would cost millions and millions of dollars said SDGE representative Carol Dorman You would also have to hire between an d employees to design and maintain the system But Thibadeau said the city would not have to buy the investorowned utilit y s distribution system in order to reap savings for its residents He would like to see the city buy the system eventually but for now the city could simply shop for electricity and pass the savings on he said SDGE would b e owed a fee for its transmission and distribution expenses but residents would save on the cost of bulk power he said As a municipal utility San Marcos also will be eligible for a share of lowcost federal hydro power which currently is selling for cents a kWh he said And the city could require all new utility easements to be dedicated to the cityowned utility rather than to SDGE Thibadeau said This would gradual ly reduce the transmission and distribution costs being charged by the private utility he said Earlier this month the California Assembly passed a bill to reduce wholesa le electricity rates of SDGE customers to about cents a kWh The payment ceiling would last until with the utility footing the bill for the remaining costs But eventually those costs plus interest would become du e said Thibadeau What have we done he asked Just spread out th e problem The uproar over electric rates in the San Diego area has drawn attention fr om the federal government
