cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the

about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for

Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for

points Beyond the two excellent editorials in todays WSJ attached the following should be the key messages The show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for

Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

talking points re California Forwarded by Richard ShapiroNAEnron on PM From Jeff Dasovich on AM Sent by Jeff Dasovich To Richard nron Paul CT Susan J NRON Sandra nron Harry nron Leslie nron James D nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for

with you yesterday Based on our conversation this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language In those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

CT James D nron Harry nron Richard nron Karen NRON BTC MSSRcom cc Subject Ken Lays email to Sen Brulte Greetings All First I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email Schedule i s very tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for helping pull this together Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich PM To Richard n ron James D nron cc Subject Steve Heres a substantially more cleanedversion with attachments Theres a hard copy on your chair Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on PM Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich PM To cc Subject Jim It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday Based on our conversation this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language In those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

points Beyond the two excellent editorials in todays WSJ attached the following should be the key messages The show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for

them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office

Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

Global Government Affairs Phone Fax Original Message From Samantha Slater ENRON Sent Monday October PM To Linnell Elizabeth Kingerski Harry Robinson Marchris Petrochko Mona L Kaufman Paul Montovano Steve Landwehr Susan M Subject FTC Staff Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform For Release October FTC Staff Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform A new staff report issued today by the Federal Trade Commission examines which features of various state retail electricity programs appear to have resulted in consumer benefits and which have not The staff report also highlights certain jurisdictional limitations on the states authority to design successful retail competition plans and discusses whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action in this regard The report Competition and Consumer Protection Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform Focus on Retail Competition updates a July FTC Staff Report and responds to a request to update that report made by the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives W J Billy Tauzin and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Joe Barton In its report FTC staff identify several overall points about how restructuring has proceeded at the state level so far The states that have moved toward competition in electricity generation and retail marketing are in a transition period during which retail price regulation will continue as some elements of competition are introduced No state has completed the transition period Most policy choices that confront states during this transition period involve tradeoffs with each option presenting potential costs and benefits Given that states are in a transition phase that represents a hybrid of regulation and competition many of the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged Nothing that has happened so far however indicates that competition once the transition period is completed will not produce additional benefits to electricity customers Competition provides stronger incentives for the efficient deployment of capital for generation investments and for suppliers to offer innovative services and products to consumers Among the main conclusions of the report and the reasoning underlying these conclusions are the following Competitive Wholesale Markets Are Important To Achieving Effective Competition In Retail Markets For all of the expected benefits of retail competition to be realized it is imperative that wholesale markets be competitive Effective wholesale and retail competition will mutually reinforce each other thus combining to bring benefits to retail customers And as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful Policies Are Needed In Retail and Wholesale Markets That Will Increase DemandSide Responsiveness So far neither retail nor wholesale markets for electricity generation encourage effective demandside responses Generally retail customers do not have price information and timesensitive rates that reflect the changing price of obtaining electricity at various times of the day and over the course of the year Increasing the price sensitivity of demand also will help to constrain existing or potential market power in generation This is true because a price increase will be less profitable for generators if it is passed through and retail buyers respond by reducing their consumption by a significant amount In conjunction with variable pricing for generation services retail suppliers should be permitted to offer competitive metering and billing services to their customers Such competition would encourage the development of innovative new services eg realtime pricing Policies that Set the Price of Standard Offer Service for NonChoosing Customers Have A Substantial Effect on the Entry of New Retail Suppliers Effective retail competition and the subsequent consumer benefits of retail competition are much more likely with actual entry State policies that eliminate barriers to entry to allow for the longrun efficient entry of entities to compete with the incumbent will assist the development of retail electricity markets Most states have required the existing distribution utility to continue to offer service standard offer service at fixed regulated rates to customers that do not choose a new supplier or whose supplier exits the market Often the duration of this service is coterminous with the time period during which the state allows the utility to recover its stranded costs those generationrelated costs that are uneconomic in a competitive environment States should design standard offer service policies that provide entrants with sufficient incentives to offer service and do not unintentionally create a barrier to entry Ensuring that standard offer service providers can pass on changes in fuel costs and wholesale electricity prices will aid this goal Initial rate reductions for standard offer service which are not based on cost reductions tend to distort entry decisions and reduce incentives for retail customers to search for alternative suppliers State Consumer Protection Policies Can Affect Both Consumers and the Likelihood of New Entry to Increase Competition Consumers choices will be made most efficiently if consumers are exposed to accurate timely and comparable information about retail suppliers of electricity Enforcement of truthinadvertising laws will help ensure that suppliers make truthful nondeceptive and substantiated advertising claims in the new retail marketplace Standardized labeling of retail electricity products and services may be beneficial to consumers and competing electricity suppliers as long as it allows suppliers to provide additional information as they begin to offer innovative services and products to consumers Consumer education programs that provide general information to increase consumer awareness about retail competition as well as nuts and bolts information to allow consumers to shop effectively and select their supplier will help to ensure that consumers have the information they need to participate effectively in competitive retail electricity markets

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for

CT James D nron Harry nron Richard nron Karen NRON BTC MSSRcom cc Subject Ken Lays email to Sen Brulte Greetings All First I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email Schedule i s very tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for

with you yesterday Based on our conversation this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language In those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

points Beyond the two excellent editorials in todays WSJ attached the following should be the key messages The show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

points Beyond the two excellent editorials in todays WSJ attached the following should be the key messages The show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

<3534409.1075840265177.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ginger.dernehl@enron.com,2000-10-10 10:36:00,Government Affairs Organizational Changesis a great time to be at Enron The challenges and opportunities at Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day This presents enormous challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us individually As we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requir es us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company While we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi n the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair s strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies The belo w mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Jim Steffes The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies Harry Kingerski Enron Broadband Services Sue Nord Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks Lisa Yoho Enron South America Jose Bestard Federal Government Affairs Linda Robertson With the impending retirement on March of Joe Hillings I am pleas ed to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office Lin da was a Congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two Washington law fir ms prior to spending the last eight years with the US Department of Treasury the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison for Secretaries Rubin Summers Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome additio n to our team In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs groups and strategy in Washington the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und er Joe Hartsoes direction will also report to Linda Joe Hartsoe will als o retain primary responsibility for NERC activities although Charles Yeung a nd Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe s in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the s t quarter of and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group reporti ng to Joe Hartsoe On a personal note I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio ns that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service Joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout Washington I will have more to say about this as Joes retirement draws closer but I look to him to be a v ital part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks I will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government Affairs organization the following changes are being made In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the EES group of companies Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed Government Affairs Support Services This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi ll soon be entering Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati on and report to Harry Jeff Brown Tom Delaney Mary Hain Ron McNamara Christi Nicolay Thane Twiggs and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Alberto Levy will be relocating from our Caracas Venezuela office and will also report to Jim A couple of special mentions Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job in leading the CUBR Coalition for Uniform Business Rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the US It is also my hope that Steve Walto n will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale electric market issues The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess es of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across North America Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin g the companys efforts at PJM Tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation Kathleen Sullivan has recently joined Steves group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard Fromer in New York Sue Nord

together by a common theme then this announcement may fall a bit short The continuing growth of the demands placed upon the Government Affairs organization has however necessitated certain modest organization al shifts and additions many of which have already occurred or have been in transition for the last several weeks Rather than attempting to explain t he rationale for each change in this memo instead I will briefly describe th em attached is a revised organizational chart and map and offer to answer a ny questions anyone might have While Sue Nord will continue to report directly to me in the role of policy development and coordination she has been and will be spending a considerable amount of her time on broadband and communications issues and will also report to Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere in that capacity Steve Montovano will assume responsibility for an additional six southeaste rn states including responsibility for SERC Marchris Robinson and Tom Chapman who has agreed to join the group on a more permanent basis as a Senior Regulatory Specialist will report to Steve Ron McNamara has also joined Steves group and will focus on the tight power pools in the Nort heast US Janine Migden will assume responsibility for the states of Tennessee Arkansas and Louisiana as well as issues related to TVA Bill Moore will now report to Janine In order to assure more intraregional coordination in the West Mary Hain who supports ENAs trading desk in Portland now reports to Paul Kaufman With Kathleen Magruders recent departure to ResCo we are actively sear ching for an individual to direct our efforts in Texas and Oklahoma as well as ou r efforts at ERCOT and the Southeast Power Pool Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere have each done an outstanding job supportin g Enron Broadband Services throughout the world these past months and will share responsibility for directing those efforts in the Americas They wil l also assume responsibility within the group for Enrons ECommerce effor ts in the Americas In addition to Sue Nord the group will consist of Tracy McLaughlin who supports Scott in Portland Xi Xi an analyst who joined us early this year in Houston and Lara Leibman who has just joined the group Lara will also continue her activities relative to the Department of Justic e and the Federal Trade Commission Ricardo Charvel in addition to his responsibilities in Mexico will assume overall responsibility for Central America the Caribbean Basin as well as Columbia and Venezuela Reporting to Ricardo are Alberto Levy who is primarily responsible for Venezuela and Columbia and Vinio Floris who recently joined us from Azurix who will be primarily responsible for Centr al America and the Caribbean Basin Tom Delaney will now report to

Gloria Ogenyi Thane Twiggs and Robert Neustaedter have all joined Harry Kingerskis group to enhance that groups ability to provide rates an d other regulatory services throughout the Americas With Tom Reichelderfers departure Susan Covino will be the sole coordi nator for the government affairs groups contractual relationship with ResCo Susan will also begin to get involved in other projects over the next sever al weeks The Federal Government Affairs group organization will have a flatter organizational structure with each individual in the group reporting direct ly to Joe Hillings Functional assignments which are reflected on one of the attachments have also been made in this group to bring additional focus to their efforts with an increased emphasis on issues related to our energy broadband services and ecommercebased business activities and a refocusin g of the groups efforts in support of commercial groups globally to bette r align them with the near and midterm objectives of the regional commercial groups throughout the world On a separate note Tom Briggs will be joini ng the Federal Government Affairs group in Washington early this summer We a re pleased to have Tom who has most recently been in London in the Enron Euro pe Government Affairs group join the Federal Government Affairs team Please join me in welcoming congratulating and wishing well the individua ls noted in this memo One final thought As we are quickly approaching the midpoint of the yea r we must stay constantly focused on our overall group objectives for the year as well as on our respective regional group objectives see attach ed Top objectives for US Canada With that said the hard work and dedication of so many individuals in the group does not go unnoticed As t he group has grown it has become increasingly difficult for me to visit the regions as frequently as I once did and to spend as much time on an individual basis with many of you My respect gratitude and affection for the people in this group only grows however with time Our collective task while both challenging and intellectually stimulating is also quite daunting with both ever growing burdens and opportunities as

Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day This presents enormous challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us individually As we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requir es us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company While we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi n the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair s strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies The belo w mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Jim Steffes The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies Harry Kingerski Enron Broadband Services Sue Nord Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks Lisa Yoho Enron South America Jose Bestard Federal Government Affairs Linda Robertson With the impending retirement on March of Joe Hillings I am pleas ed to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office Lin da was a Congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two Washington law fir ms prior to spending the last eight years with the US Department of Treasury the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison for Secretaries Rubin Summers Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome additio n to our team In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs groups and strategy in Washington the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und er Joe Hartsoes direction will also report to Linda Joe Hartsoe will als o retain primary responsibility for NERC activities although Charles Yeung a nd Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe s in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the s t quarter of and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group reporti ng to Joe Hartsoe On a personal note I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio ns that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service Joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout Washington I will have more to say about this as Joes retirement draws closer but I look to him to be a v ital part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks I will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government Affairs organization the following changes are being made In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the EES group of companies Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed Government Affairs Support Services This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi ll soon be entering Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati on and report to Harry Jeff Brown Tom Delaney Mary Hain Ron McNamara Christi Nicolay Thane Twiggs and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role supporting Enron North

in leading the CUBR Coalition for Uniform Business Rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the US It is also my hope that Steve Walto n will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale electric market issues The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess es of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across North America Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin g the companys efforts at PJM Tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation Kathleen Sullivan has recently joined Steves group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard Fromer in New York Sue Nord

last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks

Government Affairs Phone Fax Original Message From Dernehl Ginger On Behalf Of Shapiro Richard SentTuesday August AM ToSherriff John Brown Michael COO London CcLewis Richard Shaw Eric SubjectEnron Europe Government Affairs Group On my last visit to London I met with John Sherriff Richard Lewis separa tely and discussed the possibility of naming a team leader within the Enron Europe Government Affairs group The purpose of naming a team leader woul d be to provide more consistent leadership for the group on a daytoday ba sis principally on personnel issues but also to ensure that a consistent policy approach is being taken across the Government Affairs group on issue s that affect the company I know that John is ambivalent about naming suc h a team leader but I thought that I would make the case once again and hopefully in a more compelling manner so we can move forward with this idea First it is important to say what the designation of a team leader would n ot do It would not in my estimation change the nature of the reporting relationships that we currently have relative to Eric Shaw Richard Lewis a nd myself Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will continue to report to Eri c Shaw and myself and Paul Dawson and Doug Wood would continue to report t o Richard Lewis and myself Second as the unchanged nature of the report ing relationships indicate this change is in no way intended to diminish t he role of Eric andor Richard relative to the management of the Government Affairs group but merely to ensure that someone is tending to personnel administrative and group management issues on a daily basis Third by nam ing a team leader within the Government Affairs group I am not attempting in any way to step back from the role that I personally have taken on rel ative to the group I will continue to provide strategic guidance where I can and also will continue to ensure that the Enron Europe Government Aff airs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs functio n so that the Europe group is the beneficiary of knowledge and information that is developed around the world within the government affairs function The intent of designating a team leader as already stated is merely to en sure that issues related to the administration of the group consistency of external advocacy and personnel issues are handled on a timely and effect ive basis While I believe there have been many benefits from the current organizational structure one of the significant and increasingly more noti ceable negatives has been that there has not always been a consistent and f air approach to the handling of personnel issues within the group notwiths tanding my best efforts to deal with these issues from a distance This h as resulted in what I consider to be the suboptimal handling of at least one employee who is in the process of being terminated as well as inconsi stent messaging to many of the junior people within the group in terms of w hat their career opportunities are within the larger government affairs fun ction in Europe which in turn has created issues of morale These issu es in my mind are of sufficient concern that if left unaddressed the gr oups ability to sustain a record of providing excellent support throughout the organization may in time be in jeopardy I am confident that by na ming a team leader we will retain virtually all of the benefits of the col lective leadership approach that are embodied in the current structure chi ef among them greater participation from both Eric and Richard on an ongo ing basis What we will gain however by the designation of a team leader is increased and sustained attention to the issues that I have already me ntioned The person that I believe is best suited for this team leadership role is P aul Dawson My observations relative to Paul are that he understands the needs of the individuals within the group and will do everything that he can to ensure that personnel issues are handled in a fair and expeditious manner In add ition Paul has a very sound grasp of many if not all of the issues facin g Enron Europe and will provide I believe consistent leadership on substa nce as well as on personnel and administrative issues It is also my expec tation that Doug Wood who has assumed many of the administrative responsib ilities eg budget will continue to assist Paul in that capacity and th at both Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will also continue to participate in a leadership role along with Paul Dawson and Doug I believe that this is the right approach to take and it is my hope that on my next trip to London in mid September that I would be able to sit down with Paul Dawson Paul Hennemeyer Peter Styles and Doug Wood with any com bination of yourselves and lay out the modest organizational change embodi ed within this memorandum If you have any questions please feel free to contact me Thanks

together by a common theme then this announcement may fall a bit short The continuing growth of the demands placed upon the Government Affairs organization has however necessitated certain modest organization al shifts and additions many of which have already occurred or have been in transition for the last several weeks Rather than attempting to explain t he rationale for each change in this memo instead I will briefly describe th em attached is a revised organizational chart and map and offer to answer a ny questions anyone might have While Sue Nord will continue to report directly to me in the role of policy development and coordination she has been and will be spending a considerable amount of her time on broadband and communications issues and will also report to Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere in that capacity Steve Montovano will assume responsibility for an additional six southeaste rn states including responsibility for SERC Marchris Robinson and Tom Chapman who has agreed to join the group on a more permanent basis as a Senior Regulatory Specialist will report to Steve Ron McNamara has also joined Steves group and will focus on the tight power pools in the Nort heast US Janine Migden will assume responsibility for the states of Tennessee Arkansas and Louisiana as well as issues related to TVA Bill Moore will now report to Janine In order to assure more intraregional coordination in the West Mary Hain who supports ENAs trading desk in Portland now reports to Paul Kaufman With Kathleen Magruders recent departure to ResCo we are actively sear ching for an individual to direct our efforts in Texas and Oklahoma as well as ou r efforts at ERCOT and the Southeast Power Pool Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere have each done an outstanding job supportin g Enron Broadband Services throughout the world these past months and will share responsibility for directing those efforts in the Americas They wil l also assume responsibility within the group for Enrons ECommerce effor ts in the Americas In addition to Sue Nord the group will consist of Tracy McLaughlin who supports Scott in Portland Xi Xi an analyst who joined us early this year in Houston and Lara Leibman who has just joined the group Lara will also continue her activities relative to the Department of Justic e and the Federal Trade Commission Ricardo Charvel in addition to his responsibilities in Mexico will assume overall responsibility for Central America the Caribbean Basin as well as Columbia and Venezuela Reporting to Ricardo are Alberto Levy who is primarily responsible for Venezuela and Columbia and Vinio Floris who recently joined us from Azurix who will be primarily responsible for Centr al America and the Caribbean Basin Tom Delaney will now report to Jeff Brown and will support him in our continuing efforts to bring additional reform and standardization to wholesale power markets in the US Damon Harvey has also joined Jeffs group as an analyst Gloria Ogenyi Thane Twiggs and Robert Neustaedter have all joined Harry Kingerskis group to enhance that groups ability to provide rates an d other regulatory services throughout the Americas With Tom Reichelderfers departure Susan Covino will be the sole coordi nator for the government affairs groups contractual relationship with ResCo Susan will also begin to get involved in other projects over the next sever al weeks The Federal Government Affairs group organization will have a flatter organizational structure with each individual in the group reporting direct ly to Joe Hillings Functional assignments which are reflected on one of the attachments have also been made in this group to bring additional focus to their efforts with an increased emphasis on issues related to our energy broadband services and ecommercebased business activities and a refocusin g of the groups efforts in support of commercial groups globally to bette r align them with the near and midterm objectives of the regional commercial groups throughout the world On a separate note Tom Briggs will be joini ng the Federal Government Affairs group in Washington early this summer We a re pleased to have Tom who has most recently been in London in the Enron Euro pe Government Affairs group join the Federal Government Affairs team Please join me in welcoming congratulating and wishing well the individua ls noted in this memo One final thought As we are quickly approaching the midpoint of the yea r we must stay constantly focused on our overall group objectives for the year as well as on our respective regional group objectives see attach ed Top objectives for US Canada With that said the hard work and dedication of so many individuals in the group does not go unnoticed As t he group has grown it has become increasingly difficult for me to visit the regions as frequently as I once did and to spend as much time on an individual basis with many of you My respect gratitude and affection for the people in this group only grows however with time Our collective task while both challenging and intellectually stimulating is also quite daunting with both ever growing burdens and opportunities as the company continues to grow and prosper We must continue to work hard to meet our objectives but we must also find a way to keep our work and jobs in their proper perspective and to have fun during the journey Whatever I can do t o help meet those objectives I will do and of course am always open to suggestions in that regard Thank you

Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day This presents enormous challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us individually As we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requir es us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company While we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi n the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair s strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies The belo w mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Jim Steffes The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies Harry Kingerski Enron Broadband Services Sue Nord Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks Lisa Yoho Enron South America Jose Bestard Federal Government Affairs Linda Robertson With the impending retirement on March of Joe Hillings I am pleas ed to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office Lin da was a Congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two Washington law fir ms prior to spending the last eight years with the US Department of Treasury the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison for Secretaries Rubin Summers Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome additio n to our team In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs groups and strategy in Washington the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und er Joe Hartsoes direction will also report to Linda Joe Hartsoe will als o retain primary responsibility for NERC activities although Charles Yeung a nd Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe s in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the s t quarter of and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group reporti ng to Joe Hartsoe On a personal note I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio ns that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service Joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout Washington I will have more to say about this as Joes retirement draws closer but I look to him to be a v ital part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks I will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government Affairs organization the following changes are being made In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the EES group of companies Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed Government Affairs Support Services This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi ll soon be entering Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati on and report to Harry Jeff Brown Tom Delaney Mary Hain Ron McNamara Christi Nicolay Thane Twiggs and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Alberto Levy will be relocating from our Caracas Venezuela office and will also report to Jim A couple of special mentions Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job in leading the CUBR Coalition for Uniform Business Rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the US It is also my hope that Steve Walto n will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale electric market issues The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess es of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across North America Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin g the companys efforts at PJM Tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation Kathleen Sullivan has recently joined Steves group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard Fromer in New York Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere while reporting to Sue will continue to provide leadership on telecommunications issues Scott and Donald have done outstanding work and will continue to be integral to our efforts in this area Finally the Resource Commitment Review RCR process beginning wi ll be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America including Federa l Government Affairs and Mexico The RCR Committee beginning immediately will be expanded and will consist of Harry Kingerski Sue Nord Linda Roberston Jim Steffes Lisa Yoho myself Please feel

that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Government Affairs Phone Fax Original Message From Dernehl Ginger On Behalf Of Shapiro Richard SentTuesday August AM ToSherriff John Brown Michael COO London CcLewis Richard Shaw Eric SubjectEnron Europe Government Affairs Group On my last visit to London I met with John Sherriff Richard Lewis separa tely and discussed the possibility of naming a team leader within the Enron Europe Government Affairs group The purpose of naming a team leader woul d be to provide more consistent leadership for the group on a daytoday ba sis principally on personnel issues but also to ensure that a consistent policy approach is being taken across the Government Affairs group on issue s that affect the company I know that John is ambivalent about naming suc h a team leader but I thought that I would make the case once again and hopefully in a more compelling manner so we can move forward with this idea First it is important to say what the designation of a team leader would n ot do It would not in my estimation change the nature of the reporting relationships that we currently have relative to Eric Shaw Richard Lewis a nd myself Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will continue to report to Eri c Shaw and myself and Paul Dawson and Doug Wood would continue to report t o Richard Lewis and myself Second as the unchanged nature of the report ing relationships indicate this change is in no way intended to diminish t he role of Eric andor Richard relative to the management of the Government Affairs group but merely to ensure that someone is tending to personnel administrative and group management issues on a daily basis Third by nam ing a team leader within the Government Affairs group I am not attempting in any way to step back from the role that I personally have taken on rel ative to the group I will continue to provide strategic guidance where I can and also will continue to ensure that the Enron Europe Government Aff airs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs functio n so that the Europe group is the beneficiary of knowledge and information that is developed around the world within the government affairs function The intent of designating a team leader as already stated is merely to en sure that issues related to the administration of the group consistency of external advocacy and personnel issues are handled on a timely and effect ive basis While I believe there have been many benefits from the current organizational structure one of the significant and increasingly more noti ceable negatives has been that there has not always been a consistent and f air approach to the handling of personnel issues within the group notwiths tanding my best efforts to deal with these issues from a distance This h as resulted in what I consider to be the suboptimal handling of at least one employee who is in the process of being terminated as well as inconsi stent messaging to many of the junior people within the group in terms of w hat their career opportunities are within the larger government affairs fun ction in Europe which in turn has created issues of morale These issu es in my mind are of sufficient concern that if left unaddressed the gr oups ability to sustain a record of providing excellent support throughout the organization may in time be in jeopardy I am confident that by na ming a team leader we will retain virtually all of the benefits of the col lective leadership approach that are embodied in the current structure chi ef among them greater participation from both Eric and Richard on an ongo ing basis What we will gain however by the designation of a team leader is increased and sustained attention to the issues that I have already me ntioned The person that I believe is best suited for this team leadership role is P aul Dawson My observations relative to Paul are that he understands the needs of the individuals within the group and will do everything that he can to ensure that personnel issues are handled in a fair and expeditious manner In add ition Paul has a very sound grasp of many if not all of the issues facin g Enron Europe and will provide I believe consistent leadership on substa nce as well as on personnel and administrative issues It is also my expec tation that Doug Wood who has assumed many of the administrative responsib ilities eg budget will continue to assist Paul in that capacity and th at both Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will also continue to participate in a leadership role along with Paul Dawson and Doug I believe that this is the right approach to take and it is my hope that on my next trip to London in mid September that I would be able to sit down with Paul Dawson Paul Hennemeyer Peter Styles and Doug Wood with any com bination of yourselves and lay out the modest organizational change embodi ed within this memorandum If you have any questions please feel free to contact me Thanks

Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day This presents enormous challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us individually As we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requir es us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company While we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi n the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair s strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies The belo w mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Jim Steffes The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies Harry Kingerski Enron Broadband Services Sue Nord Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks Lisa Yoho Enron South America Jose Bestard Federal Government Affairs Linda Robertson With the impending retirement on March of Joe Hillings I am pleas ed to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office Lin da was a Congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two Washington law fir ms prior to spending the last eight years with the US Department of Treasury the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison for Secretaries Rubin Summers Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome additio n to our team In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs groups and strategy in Washington the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und er Joe Hartsoes direction will also report to Linda Joe Hartsoe will als o retain primary responsibility for NERC activities although Charles Yeung a nd Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe s in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the s t quarter of and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group reporti ng to Joe Hartsoe On a personal note I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio ns that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service Joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout Washington I will have more to say about this as Joes retirement draws closer but I look to him to be a v ital part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks I will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government Affairs organization the following changes are being made In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the EES group of companies Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed Government Affairs Support Services This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi ll soon be entering Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati on and report to Harry Jeff Brown Tom Delaney Mary Hain Ron McNamara Christi Nicolay Thane Twiggs and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role supporting Enron North

in leading the CUBR Coalition for Uniform Business Rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the US It is also my hope that Steve Walto n will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale electric market issues The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess es of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across North America Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin g the companys efforts at PJM Tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation Kathleen Sullivan has recently joined Steves group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard Fromer in New York Sue Nord

together by a common theme then this announcement may fall a bit short The continuing growth of the demands placed upon the Government Affairs organization has however necessitated certain modest organization al shifts and additions many of which have already occurred or have been in transition for the last several weeks Rather than attempting to explain t he rationale for each change in this memo instead I will briefly describe th em attached is a revised organizational chart and map and offer to answer a ny questions anyone might have While Sue Nord will continue to report directly to me

Enron Broadband Services throughout the world these past months and will share responsibility for directing those efforts in the Americas They wil l also assume responsibility within the group for

the next sever al weeks The Federal Government Affairs group organization will have a flatter organizational structure with each individual in the group reporting direct ly to Joe Hillings Functional assignments which are reflected on one of the attachments have also been made in this group to bring additional focus to their efforts with an increased emphasis on issues related to our energy broadband services and ecommercebased business activities and a refocusin g of the groups efforts in support of commercial groups globally to bette r align them with the near and midterm objectives of the regional commercial groups throughout the world On a separate note Tom Briggs will be joini ng the Federal Government Affairs group in Washington early this summer We a re pleased to have Tom who has most recently been in London in the Enron Euro pe Government Affairs group join the Federal Government Affairs team Please join me in welcoming congratulating and wishing well the individua ls noted in this memo One final thought As we are quickly approaching the midpoint of the yea r we must stay constantly focused on our overall group objectives for the year as well as on our respective regional group objectives see attach ed Top objectives for US Canada With that said the hard work and dedication of so many individuals in the group does not go unnoticed As t he group has grown it has become increasingly difficult for me to visit the regions as frequently as I once did and to spend as much time on an individual basis with many of you My respect gratitude and affection for the people in this group only grows however with time Our collective task while both challenging and intellectually stimulating is also quite daunting with both ever growing burdens and opportunities as the company continues to grow and prosper We must continue to work hard to meet our objectives but we must also find a way to keep our work and jobs in their proper perspective and to have fun during

nron Richard nron Mark NRON Eric NRON Cindy nron Ginger nron Maureen nron Subject ACORN press release This was sent to me today by a person who asks to remain anonymous It appears this press release is being routed to members of the press Lora ACORN Launches Campaign to Win Changes from Enron Contact Lisa Clauson at cornorg or office cel or David Swanson at ACORN the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now has launched a nationwide campaign to persuade the nations largest energy supplier the Houstonbased Enron corporation to put some of its enormous record profits into assistance for lowincome Americans who cannot afford their skyrocketing utilities bills The campaign was launched with demonstrations in eight cities on May In Washington DC ACORN members from DC Philadelphia and Baltimore protested at an Enron office and demanded a meeting to discuss their concerns Representatives of ACORN and Enron met on May to open the discussion We told them our campaign was just getting started and they could expect the pressure to build if they decline to work with us on a solution in the near future Summer is almost here and elderly people and children without fans and airconditioning are going to be in danger said Kathy Tomosky an ACORN member from Philadelphia While ACORN has been pushing local governments to do their part and has worked to increase funding for LIHEAP the LowIncome HomeEnergy Assistance Program its members believe wholesalers which are making huge profits as others face crises also have a responsibility to act Other Demonstrations on Monday Included In Sacramento ACORN members from around California protested at the offices of Enrons lobbying company Governmental Associates They also protested at the Capitol demanding a meeting with Gov Gray Davis to discuss the need for a moratorium on shutoffs and the need for lower rates for low and moderateincome people In Portland ACORN members took over the thfloor office of EnronPortland General Electric and staged a sitin until they won a commitment to a meeting with PGEs CEO In Chicago ACORN members marched into the thfloor office of Enron They persuaded the staff to fax a letter to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay see below and arranged to schedule a meeting with Enron in Chicago ACORN members also took over the lobby of Enrons headquarters in Houston and demonstrated at Enron offices in Manhattan Denver and Albuquerque THE CASE AGAINST ENRON Energy wholesalers like Enron and their top executives are raking in outrageous record profits while millions of Americans are facing bills that have doubled and tripled putting many at risk of losing their electricity and at risk of losing their lives during this summers heat spells During heat spells in previous years hundreds of children and elderly people without fans or air conditioning have perished The Bush energy plan does nothing to address the immediate crisis of this summer a crisis that will literally be a question of life and death for tens of thousands of small children and the elderly Senior citizens on fixed incomes and hard workers fighting to support families on low wages will face hot days without the electricity to run a fan cook food or refrigerate milk for the kids Inflated energy bills are effectively reducing the standard of living for millions of Americans to preWorld War II levels in a world less adapted to life without power Price gouging by wholesalers and inaction by the White House could condemn thousands of people to a painful death Bushs devotion to corporate profits will apparently not give way even in the face of these real tragedies looming over so many of our grandparents and grandchildren Five years ago people died in Chicago during a twoweek heat spell subsequent examination of the dead by the Chicago Tribune found that almost all were lower income seniors or young kids who did not have air conditioning and who were trying to save on their electric bills by not running their fans at night Many were without power Enron the nations biggest energy supplier saw its profits increase percent in Its revenue more than doubled to billion from only billion in an increase of percent The vast majority of Enron s business involves buying electricity from power plants and selling it at a markup to local utility companies While millions of Americans are facing choices between utilities and food between utilities and health insurance between utilities and childcare Enron executives arent feeling the pinch Enrons Chairman Kenneth Lay received a million bonus as reward for an extremely strong year Lays salary last year gave him another million He also collected million in restricted stock awards plus options for shares that could be valued at million if Enrons stock appreciated percent annually Families now struggling to pay their bills are available to comment Contact Chris Saffert at Lay is living like a king while inflicting suffering on others and our government is aiding and abetting this behavior The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to act to make energy affordable for residential users Texas the home of George Bush is also home to the largest energy suppliers in the country including Enron Enron executives and employees contributed more than to Bushs campaigns for governor and president About came from Lay who was one of the Bush Pioneers who raised at least for the presidential campaign Lay also gave Bush use of Enrons private jet during the presidential race For the inaugural festivities Lay Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and the corporation itself each contributed the maximum Does this perhaps explain Bushs reluctance to do anything to help California consumers Enron sold natural gas and electric power in California last year According to a study by the California Independent System Operator Enron earned excess profits of million by exercising market power Enron is being sued for violating the City of San Franciscos unfair business practices law Santa Clara County has joined a lawsuit against power suppliers including Enron alleging they conspired to raise prices and boost profits while subjecting consumers to higher bills and blackouts ACORNs Demands ACORN demands a nationwide moratorium on utility shutoffs this summer for the elderly and families with children to be funded with an excess profit tax on wholesale energy suppliers ACORN demands national price caps on utility costs for residential use ACORN demands that Enron use some of its vast profits for an expanded energy assistance program help leverage federal government funding for energy assistance and assist in the creation of a conservation program that will supply lowincome consumers with home audits energyefficient appliances and other energysaving steps LETTER THAT HAS BEEN FAXED Kenneth Lay Chair Enron Corporation Smith Street Houston TX May Dear Mr Lay We write to request a meeting to discuss the sky high fuel costs that are posing a huge and unmanageable burden for low and moderate income people across the country We believe that you along with the other major power suppliers across the country especially those which have enjoyed windfall profits as our budgets have been stretched to the breaking point have a real responsibility to make sure that our families do not have to continue to make such difficult choices between fuel and food or medicine We want to talk with you about what we can do together to ease this burden Enron has been making windfall profits selling power and thereby contributing to the suffering of our members and other community residents from record high utility bills that threaten families ability to meet our basic needs ACORN demands that Enron take real steps to help solve the problems that they have helped create We need to end skyrocketing utility bills which leave us totally unable to make ends meet and threaten vulnerable people with airconditioning and refrigeration shut offs in the dangerous summer heat Enron must respond to the immediate crisis by contributing of their profits or million to a fuel emergency fund to provide assistance to low and moderate income consumers and especially the elderly children and people with health problems in paying their utility bills A limited portion of the funds should be dedicated to outreach to sign up eligible participants We need to help people reduce costs in the long terms by making their homes more energy efficient Enron must provide funds to support comprehensive residential conservation efforts in both owner occupied and rental properties Such efforts would include home audits to determine what was needed along with the provision and installation of appropriate technology including power saving refrigerators improved insulation and sealing of doors windows and pipes etc We need basic access affordability and fair rates for the future Enron must Support ACORNs demand for a moratorium on shut offs to vulnerable populations including households with elderly people young children and people with health problems Support ACORNs efforts to win a comprehensive and government supported program to cap utility payments for low and moderate income customers at a limited percentage of income Support price caps on wholesale electricity sales such as those proposed in the Feinstein Smith bill Join ACORN in requesting a meeting between ACORN and Vice President Dick Cheney to discuss energy costs As you may know ACORN is the nations oldest and largest grassroots organization of low and moderate income people with more than member families across the country Over the years we have been extremely active on issues relating to utilities and in recent months our members in cities from Chicago to Philadelphia to St Louis and Seattle have been fighting to protect our members and our communities from utility shutoffs and for payment assistance plans to help pay utility bills We would appreciate a response today on a date and time for a meeting between yourself and other appropriate senior personnel and a team of our senior leaders within the next two weeks You can contact me through our campaign director Lisa Clauson at Sincerely Maude Hurd ACORN National President Contact Lisa Clauson at cornorg or office cel or David Swanson at ACORN the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now is the nations largest community organization of low and moderateincome families with over member families organized into neighborhood chapters in cities across the country Since ACORN has taken action and won victories on issues of concern to our members Our priorities include better housing for first time homebuyers and tenants living wages for lowwage workers more investment in our communities from banks and governments and better public schools We achieve these goals by building community

points Beyond the two excellent editorials in todays WSJ attached the following should be the key messages The show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

<16814838.1075842994749.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ginger.dernehl@enron.com,2000-10-10 10:36:00,Government Affairs Organizational Changesis a great time to be at Enron The challenges and opportunities at Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day This presents enormous challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us individually As we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requir es us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company While we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi n the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair s strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies The belo w mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Jim Steffes The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies Harry Kingerski Enron Broadband Services Sue Nord Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks Lisa Yoho Enron South America Jose Bestard Federal Government Affairs Linda Robertson With the impending retirement on March of Joe Hillings I am pleas ed to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office Lin da was a Congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two Washington law fir ms prior to spending the last eight years with the US Department of Treasury the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison for Secretaries Rubin Summers Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome additio n to our team In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs groups and strategy in Washington the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und er Joe Hartsoes direction will also report to Linda Joe Hartsoe will als o retain primary responsibility for NERC activities although Charles Yeung a nd Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe s in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the s t quarter of and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group reporti ng to Joe Hartsoe On a personal note I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio ns that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service Joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout Washington I will have more to say about this as Joes retirement draws closer but I look to him to be a v ital part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks I will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government Affairs organization the following changes are being made In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the EES group of companies Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed Government Affairs Support Services This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi ll soon be entering Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati on and report to Harry Jeff Brown Tom Delaney Mary Hain Ron McNamara Christi Nicolay Thane Twiggs and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Alberto Levy will be relocating from our Caracas Venezuela office and will also report to Jim A couple of special mentions Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job in leading the CUBR Coalition for Uniform Business Rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the US It is also my hope that Steve Walto n will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale electric market issues The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess es of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across North America Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin g the companys efforts at PJM Tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation Kathleen Sullivan has recently joined Steves group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard Fromer in New York Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere while reporting to Sue will continue to provide leadership on telecommunications issues Scott and Donald have done outstanding work and will continue to be integral to our efforts in this area Finally the Resource Commitment Review RCR process beginning wi ll be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America including Federa l Government Affairs and Mexico The RCR Committee beginning immediately will be expanded and will consist of Harry Kingerski Sue Nord Linda Roberston Jim Steffes Lisa Yoho myself Please feel free to call me if you have any questions Thank you

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Brink CERA Alert CERA Alert Dcember Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions

CT James D nron Harry nron Richard nron Karen NRON BTC MSSRcom cc Subject Ken Lays email to Sen Brulte Greetings All First I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email Schedule i s very tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for helping pull this together Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich PM To Richard n ron James D nron cc Subject Steve Heres a substantially more cleanedversion with attachments Theres a hard copy on your chair Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on PM Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich PM To cc Subject Jim It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday Based on our conversation this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language In those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

Government Affairs Phone Fax Original Message From Samantha Slater ENRON Sent Monday October PM To Linnell Elizabeth Kingerski Harry Robinson Marchris Petrochko Mona L Kaufman Paul Montovano Steve Landwehr Susan M Subject FTC Staff Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform For Release October FTC Staff Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform A new staff report issued today by the Federal Trade Commission examines which features of various state retail electricity programs appear to have resulted in consumer benefits and which have not The staff report also highlights certain jurisdictional limitations on the states authority to design successful retail competition plans and discusses whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action in this regard The report Competition and Consumer Protection Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform Focus on Retail Competition updates a July FTC Staff Report and responds to a request to update that report made by the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives W J Billy Tauzin and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Joe Barton In its report FTC staff identify several overall points about how restructuring has proceeded at the state level so far The states that have moved toward competition in electricity generation and retail marketing are in a transition period during which retail price regulation will continue as some elements of competition are introduced No state has completed the transition period Most policy choices that confront states during this transition period involve tradeoffs with each option presenting potential costs and benefits Given that states are in a transition phase that represents a hybrid of regulation and competition many of the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged Nothing that has happened so far however indicates that competition once the transition period is completed will not produce additional benefits to electricity customers Competition provides stronger incentives for the efficient deployment of capital for generation investments and for suppliers to offer innovative services and products to consumers Among the main conclusions of the report and the reasoning underlying these conclusions are the following Competitive Wholesale Markets Are Important To Achieving Effective Competition In Retail Markets For all of the expected benefits of retail competition to be realized it is imperative that wholesale markets be competitive Effective wholesale and retail competition will mutually reinforce each other thus combining to bring benefits to retail customers And as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful Policies Are Needed In Retail and Wholesale Markets That Will Increase DemandSide Responsiveness So far neither retail nor wholesale markets for electricity generation encourage effective demandside responses Generally retail customers do not have price information and timesensitive rates that reflect the changing price of obtaining electricity at various times of the day and over the course of the year Increasing the price sensitivity of demand also will help to constrain existing or potential market power in generation This is true because a price increase will be less profitable for generators if it is passed through and retail buyers respond by reducing their consumption by a significant amount In conjunction with variable pricing for generation services retail suppliers should be permitted to offer competitive metering and billing services to their customers Such competition would encourage the development of innovative new services eg realtime pricing Policies that Set the Price of Standard Offer Service for NonChoosing Customers Have A Substantial Effect on the Entry of New Retail Suppliers Effective retail competition and the subsequent consumer benefits of retail competition are much more likely with actual entry State policies that eliminate barriers to entry to allow for the longrun efficient entry of entities to compete with the incumbent will assist the development of retail electricity markets Most states have required the existing distribution utility to continue to offer service standard offer service at fixed regulated rates to customers that do not choose a new supplier or whose supplier exits the market Often the duration of this service is coterminous with the time period during which the state allows the utility to recover its stranded costs those generationrelated costs that are uneconomic in a competitive environment States should design standard offer service policies that provide entrants with sufficient incentives to offer service and do not unintentionally create a barrier to entry Ensuring that standard offer service providers can pass on changes in fuel costs and wholesale electricity prices will aid this goal Initial rate reductions for standard offer service which are not based on cost reductions tend to distort entry decisions and reduce incentives for retail customers to search for alternative suppliers State Consumer Protection Policies Can Affect Both Consumers and the Likelihood of New Entry to Increase Competition Consumers choices will be made most efficiently if consumers are exposed to accurate timely and comparable information about retail suppliers of electricity Enforcement of truthinadvertising laws will help ensure that suppliers make truthful nondeceptive and substantiated advertising claims in the new retail marketplace Standardized labeling of retail electricity products and services may be beneficial to consumers and competing electricity suppliers as long as it allows suppliers to provide additional information as they begin to offer innovative services and products to consumers Consumer education programs that provide general information to increase consumer awareness about retail competition as well as nuts and bolts information to allow consumers to shop effectively and select their supplier will help to ensure that consumers have the information they need to participate effectively in competitive retail electricity markets

Coordinator Global Government Affairs Phone Fax Original Message From Samantha Slater ENRON Sent Monday October PM To Linnell Elizabeth Kingerski Harry Robinson Marchris Petrochko Mona L Kaufman Paul Montovano Steve Landwehr Susan M Subject FTC Staff Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform For Release October FTC Staff Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform A new staff report issued today by the Federal Trade Commission examines which features of various state retail electricity programs appear to have resulted in consumer benefits and which have not The staff report also highlights certain jurisdictional limitations on the states authority to design successful retail competition plans and discusses whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action in this regard The report Competition and Consumer Protection Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform Focus on Retail Competition updates a July FTC Staff Report and responds to a request to update that report made by the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives W J Billy Tauzin and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Joe Barton In its report FTC staff identify several overall points about how restructuring has proceeded at the state level so far The states that have moved toward competition in electricity generation and retail marketing are in a transition period during which retail price regulation will continue as some elements of competition are introduced No state has completed the transition period Most policy choices that confront states during this transition period involve tradeoffs with each option presenting potential costs and benefits Given that states are in a transition phase that represents a hybrid of regulation and competition many of the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged Nothing that has happened so far however indicates that competition once the transition period is completed will not produce additional benefits to electricity customers Competition provides stronger incentives for the efficient deployment of capital for generation investments and for suppliers to offer innovative services and products to consumers Among the main conclusions of the report and the reasoning underlying these conclusions are the following Competitive Wholesale Markets Are Important To Achieving Effective Competition In Retail Markets For all of the expected benefits of retail competition to be realized it is imperative that wholesale markets be competitive Effective wholesale and retail competition will mutually reinforce each other thus combining to bring benefits to retail customers And as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful Policies Are Needed In Retail and Wholesale Markets That Will Increase DemandSide Responsiveness So far neither retail nor wholesale markets for electricity generation encourage effective demandside responses Generally retail customers do not have price information and timesensitive rates that reflect the changing price of obtaining electricity at various times of the day and over the course of the year Increasing the price sensitivity of demand also will help to constrain existing or potential market power in generation This is true because a price increase will be less profitable for generators if it is passed through and retail buyers respond by reducing their consumption by a significant amount In conjunction with variable pricing for generation services retail suppliers should be permitted to offer competitive metering and billing services to their customers Such competition would encourage the development of innovative new services eg realtime pricing Policies that Set the Price of Standard Offer Service for NonChoosing Customers Have A Substantial Effect on the Entry of New Retail Suppliers Effective retail competition and the subsequent consumer benefits of retail competition are much more likely with actual entry State policies that eliminate barriers to entry to allow for the longrun efficient entry of entities to compete with the incumbent will assist the development of retail electricity markets Most states have required the existing distribution utility to continue to offer service standard offer service at fixed regulated rates to customers that do not choose a new supplier or whose supplier exits the market Often the duration of this service is coterminous with the time period during which the state allows the utility to recover its stranded costs those generationrelated costs that are uneconomic in a competitive environment States should design standard offer service policies that provide entrants with sufficient incentives to offer service and do not unintentionally create a barrier to entry Ensuring that standard offer service providers can pass on changes in fuel costs and wholesale electricity prices will aid this goal Initial rate reductions for standard offer service which are not based on cost reductions tend to distort entry decisions and reduce incentives for retail customers to search for alternative suppliers State Consumer Protection Policies Can Affect Both Consumers and the Likelihood of New Entry to Increase Competition Consumers choices will be made most efficiently if consumers are exposed to accurate timely and comparable information about retail suppliers of electricity Enforcement of truthinadvertising laws will help ensure that suppliers make truthful nondeceptive and substantiated advertising claims in the new retail marketplace Standardized labeling of retail electricity products and services may be beneficial to consumers and competing electricity suppliers as long as it allows suppliers to provide additional information as they begin to offer innovative services and products to consumers Consumer education programs that provide general information to increase consumer awareness about retail competition as well as nuts and bolts information to allow consumers to shop effectively and select their supplier will help to ensure that consumers have the information they need to participate effectively in competitive retail electricity markets

Greg CT Patrick CT Tom CT Bill CT Lloyd CT Subject Reg Information Interconnecting Generation in the East This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBh I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not allowed under the new FERC rule Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC PJM NEPOOL Ameren Entergy ComEd Enron is actively protesting Entergys proposed procedures and interconnection agreement a FERC order is expected In addition ComEds procedures have been protested and a FERC order is expected soon Other utilities may be filing their procedures shortly Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements I am happy to review them An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Please forward this to Ricks group Thanks Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer price spikes better preparation for summer through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

points Beyond the two excellent editorials in todays WSJ attached the following should be the key messages The show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in It should not surprise anyone that two Berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the New York Times would ignore Econ and suggest that the solution for Californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations Such pinings have been abandoned over the past years but if the New York Times wants to stake out that position fine It will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New Deal regulations The show completely ignored the failings of Californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance Of the electricity consumed in California less than percent is generated by companies headquartered in Texas More than percent of the electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the Texas pirates These good pirates include the Bonneville Power Administration the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the Government of British Columbia and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Business World Californias Ship of Fools By Holman W Jenkins Jr The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Lamenting the politicians lot in Profiles in Courage John F Kennedy wrote that In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue Of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some courage We dont know what happens when an advanced economy like Californias suffers day after day of blackouts We may be about to find out Modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat So may drivers at unlit traffic crossings Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame Gov Gray Davis prates about a war with Texas And who knows what secret failures as a human being led Bill Lockyer the attorney general to threaten Enrons Ken Lay with homosexual rape in the California prison system California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis Mr Lockyer and Mr Davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates Both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across Western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from Californias mistakes across half a dozen other states In California itself municipal utilities in Santa Clara Palo Alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isnt volunteering Why should voters in other states Why not just cut the lines and let California monopolize the darkness A state review board in Washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for California Mr Davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages Meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power Mr Daviss version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame Texas companies account for just of Californias supply having bought of the megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation Being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services Take Enron Its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest gougers BC Hydro owned by Canadian taxpayers and the US Bonneville Power Administration Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to California during the day These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the West making the shortages worse probably much worse Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to California megawatts enough for two million homes Farmers could resume irrigating Seattle Tacoma Boise and other neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand Rather than emulate them Gov Daviss peacock of an energy czar David Freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr Freemans antique New Deal schemes Whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer One large source of untapped power is Californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities Their fee scale is set by the state but California couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so megawatts sit idle People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the California mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the Columbia River system werent down from normal Last summer Californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder Yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously California continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance But the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save California from itself We said back in December theres only one solution Jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal The only question was when Gov Davis would find the courage Hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down Someone should point out to Gov Davis that the author of Profiles in Courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts Not a few people in public life understand this Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life But Mr Davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career What borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis By all rights Gov Davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of million people of the Republican opposition Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial California Squeaks By The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray Davis has done nothing but squeak at it At first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders But lately he has focused on FERC and President Bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power Hes even rustled up economists including the dad of deregulation Alfred Kahn to support him Well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work If caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse Even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand The usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing Indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out The propricecaps argument however is a clever one It rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the California energy market According to one of the propricecap economists Paul Joskow at MIT the energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions Mr Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that to of the wholesale prices of electricity during June July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections As an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming Especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals Such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in California natural gas has been rising over the past year Such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation Such as the fact that imports into the state which were running and up to during peak usage have declined And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically At any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed Californias neighbors the states of Washington Idaho Wyoming Arizona Nevada Oregon Utah and Montana have had to bump up utility rates to So where is the tablet of stone saying that California with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different The bad news for California is that poor dears it cant be different Market fundamentals like supply and demand rule But thats also the good news High wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines Too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen to from last year doubtless a response to a temporary rate hike in January and the California Public Utilities Commissions decision in March to finally really really raise rates by as much as on average The details of that plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this months bills So Californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over The market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary Of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand And California will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts But in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices Unfortunately Californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery Ultimately we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

nron Richard nron Mark NRON Eric NRON Cindy nron Ginger nron Maureen nron Subject ACORN press release This was sent to me today by a person who asks to remain anonymous It appears this press release is being routed to members of the press Lora ACORN Launches Campaign to Win Changes from Enron Contact Lisa Clauson at cornorg or office cel or David Swanson at ACORN the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now has launched a nationwide campaign to persuade the nations largest energy supplier the Houstonbased Enron corporation to put some of its enormous record profits into assistance for lowincome Americans who cannot afford their skyrocketing utilities bills The campaign was launched with demonstrations in eight cities on May In Washington DC ACORN members from DC Philadelphia and Baltimore protested at an Enron office and demanded a meeting to discuss their concerns Representatives of ACORN and Enron met on May to open the discussion We told them our campaign was just getting started and they could expect the pressure to build if they decline to work with us on a solution in the near future Summer is almost here and elderly people and children without fans and airconditioning are going to be in danger said Kathy Tomosky an ACORN member from Philadelphia While ACORN has been pushing local governments to do their part and has worked to increase funding for LIHEAP the LowIncome HomeEnergy Assistance Program its members believe wholesalers which are making huge profits as others face crises also have a responsibility to act Other Demonstrations on Monday Included In Sacramento ACORN members from around California protested at the offices of Enrons lobbying company Governmental Associates They also protested at the Capitol demanding a meeting with Gov Gray Davis to discuss the need for a moratorium on shutoffs and the need for lower rates for low and moderateincome people In Portland ACORN members took over the thfloor office of EnronPortland General Electric and staged a sitin until they won a commitment to a meeting with PGEs CEO In Chicago ACORN members marched into the thfloor office of Enron They persuaded the staff to fax a letter to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay see below and arranged to schedule a meeting with Enron in Chicago ACORN members also took over the lobby of Enrons headquarters in Houston and demonstrated at Enron offices in Manhattan Denver and Albuquerque THE CASE AGAINST ENRON Energy wholesalers like Enron and their top executives are raking in outrageous record profits while millions of Americans are facing bills that have doubled and tripled putting many at risk of losing their electricity and at risk of losing their lives during this summers heat spells During heat spells in previous years hundreds of children and elderly people without fans or air conditioning have perished The Bush energy plan does nothing to address the immediate crisis of this summer a crisis that will literally be a question of life and death for tens of thousands of small children and the elderly Senior citizens on fixed incomes and hard workers fighting to support families on low wages will face hot days without the electricity to run a fan cook food or refrigerate milk for the kids Inflated energy bills are effectively reducing the standard of living for millions of Americans to preWorld War II levels in a world less adapted to life without power Price gouging by wholesalers and inaction by the White House could condemn thousands of people to a painful death Bushs devotion to corporate profits will apparently not give way even in the face of these real tragedies looming over so many of our grandparents and grandchildren Five years ago people died in Chicago during a twoweek heat spell subsequent examination of the dead by the Chicago Tribune found that almost all were lower income seniors or young kids who did not have air conditioning and who were trying to save on their electric bills by not running their fans at night Many were without power Enron the nations biggest energy supplier saw its profits increase percent in Its revenue more than doubled to billion from only billion in an increase of percent The vast majority of Enron s business involves buying electricity from power plants and selling it at a markup to local utility companies While millions of Americans are facing choices between utilities and food between utilities and health insurance between utilities and childcare Enron executives arent feeling the pinch Enrons Chairman Kenneth Lay received a million bonus as reward for an extremely strong year Lays salary last year gave him another million He also collected million in restricted stock awards plus options for shares that could be valued at million if Enrons stock appreciated percent annually Families now struggling to pay their bills are available to comment Contact Chris Saffert at Lay is living like a king while inflicting suffering on others and our government is aiding and abetting this behavior The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to act to make energy affordable for residential users Texas the home of George Bush is also home to the largest energy suppliers in the country including Enron Enron executives and employees contributed more than to Bushs campaigns for governor and president About came from Lay who was one of the Bush Pioneers who raised at least for the presidential campaign Lay also gave Bush use of Enrons private jet during the presidential race For the inaugural festivities Lay Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and the corporation itself each contributed the maximum Does this perhaps explain Bushs reluctance to do anything to help California consumers Enron sold natural gas and electric power in California last year According to a study by the California Independent System Operator Enron earned excess profits of million by exercising market power Enron is being sued for violating the City of San Franciscos unfair business practices law Santa Clara County has joined a lawsuit against power suppliers including Enron alleging they conspired to raise prices and boost profits while subjecting consumers to higher bills and blackouts ACORNs Demands ACORN demands a nationwide moratorium on utility shutoffs this summer for the elderly and families with children to be funded with an excess profit tax on wholesale energy suppliers ACORN demands national price caps on utility costs for residential use ACORN demands that Enron use some of its vast profits for an expanded energy assistance program help leverage federal government funding for energy assistance and assist in the creation of a conservation program that will supply lowincome consumers with home audits energyefficient appliances and other energysaving steps LETTER THAT HAS BEEN FAXED Kenneth Lay Chair Enron Corporation Smith Street Houston TX May Dear Mr Lay We write to request a meeting to discuss the sky high fuel costs that are posing a huge and unmanageable burden for low and moderate income people across the country We believe that you along with the other major power suppliers across the country especially those which have enjoyed windfall profits as our budgets have been stretched to the breaking point have a real responsibility to make sure that our families do not have to continue to make such difficult choices between fuel and food or medicine We want to talk with you about what we can do together to ease this burden Enron has been making windfall profits selling power and thereby contributing to the suffering of our members and other community residents from record high utility bills that threaten families ability to meet our basic needs ACORN demands that Enron take real steps to help solve the problems that they have helped create We need to end skyrocketing utility bills which leave us totally unable to make ends meet and threaten vulnerable people with airconditioning and refrigeration shut offs in the dangerous summer heat Enron must respond to the immediate crisis by contributing of their profits or million to a fuel emergency fund to provide assistance to low and moderate income consumers and especially the elderly children and people with health problems in paying their utility bills A limited portion of the funds should be dedicated to outreach to sign up eligible participants We need to help people reduce costs in the long terms by making their homes more energy efficient Enron must provide funds to

article which appeared in the August edition of the San Francisco Chronicle Ginger please also routedistribute to those whom you deem appropriate Thanks Joseph Alamo Sr Administrative Assistant

cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL August SF Chronicle Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for HardHit San DiegoCritics say more relief needed for deregulation David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Responding to calls for action from Gov Gray Davis the California Public Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in San Diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months However the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San Diegans can be charged for power Im extremely extremely disappointed said San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob who flew up for yesterdays PUC meeting in San Francisco with other local officials Former San Diego Mayor Maureen OConnor urged California legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether To continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said OConnor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer We already have the train wreck in San Diego she said Its coming your way next The PUC voted to to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than per month through Jan Their bills would be capped at a month for the remainder of next year Business customers using no more than kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at until the end of January subsequently rising to a month Michael Shames executive director of San Diegos Utility Consumers Action Network acknowledged that the average residence uses kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users Many San Diego Gas Electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the PUCs rate cap he said The PUCs measure Shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle RESTAURANTS BILL SOARS One San Diego business owner Susan Bauman said her restaurant used kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than For the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than The commission just doesnt get it said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco consumer group The commissions vote was along party lines with the three Republican appointees Henry Duque Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper voting in favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers In speeches prior to the vote San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal We did take some action today Lynch the PUC president said in an interview afterward But clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in San Diego the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply LOBBYING BEGINS After yesterdays PUC vote the San Diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan Golding piled into cars and headed for Sacramento They said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief This is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area Golding said We need relief and we need it now Earlier this month the state Senate voted to to approve a plan to roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels Passage of the bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the PUC meeting Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for structural and academic improvements Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

nron Karen NRON Linda NRON Joe NRON cc Subject DRAFT Message Points for Hertzberg Conversationq Here are some draft message points Please review Apologies in advance i s theyre a little rough but these guys are getting bothersome at this point Best Jeff Recent legislative proposals designed to give the State the role of developing owning and operating power plants in California SBXBurton and buy PGE and Edisons electric transmission assets SBXBurton a re taking California in the wrong direction and wont solve the States electricity crisis Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counterproductive ABX Hertzerg would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at just and reasonable cost based rates SBX Spier would classify powe r plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a politica l as opposed to an economic commercial financial or technical solution Around the rest of the world governments are privatizing these industries relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure an d the products and services that derive from that infrastructure Astonishingly California is moving in the opposite direction toward a stateowned and operated centrallyplanned industry The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come As a political solution these bills will not increase supply decrease demand or get the utilities back on their financial feet In fact they are likely to do just the opposite They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget The transmission buyout contemplated in SBX is extremely complex requiri ng buyin from state and federal authorities bondholders creditors and others California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal with no certainty of success particularly in view of PGEs public opposition There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PGE and Edison even if it did manage to complete the transaction Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading In the meantime summer approaches and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering This complex costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer When those blackouts arriveand they will unless bold action is taken sw iftly consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the pri ce of utility transmission assets As important it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buyout offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court Indeed when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buyout particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in whi ch the debate is taking place creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court If that happens the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation Moreover SBX squarely inserts the State into the power plant business despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing t o invest in CaliforniaIF California provides the investment environment t o attract that capital Unfortunately these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital Distressingly the state could finance develop own andor operate power plants at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system In addition any company that uses the newlycreated Power Authority s financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set b y the Authority or if the developer is a utility by the California PUC In sum the biggest player in the power businessthe Statewill contr ol the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market The state will control the price to use the network and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services This scenario makes the old verticallyintegrated monopoly structure look inviting Capital markets will run from this solution and put capital to more productive uses outside of California Under this proposed solution only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants and the state will be forced to finance them Thats the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were higher than the national average Weve been down that route its been given chance after chance to su cceed and its failed Stateownership and intrusive regulation havent wo rked in the past and they wont work today This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California increase the likelihood of bankruptcy and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate andor expand operations all of which put Californias economy at risk The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first timelay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment invest rather than chase it away Forwarded by

CT James D nron Harry nron Richard nron Karen NRON BTC MSSRcom cc Subject Ken Lays email to Sen Brulte Greetings All First I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email Schedule i s very tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning with some backup info that Ive included below Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals We didnt finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage Were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying tha t DWR will get its money for power purchase costs Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly Ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in California To the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best reached to day by pager at Thanks to all for helping pull this together Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich PM To Richard n ron James D nron cc Subject Steve Heres a substantially more cleanedversion with attachments Theres a hard copy on your chair Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on PM Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich PM To cc Subject Jim It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday Based on our conversation this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to ABX We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable option Our assessment of the supplydemand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language In those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes in Installing Smallscale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet VicePresident Enron North America California Street Suite San Francisco CA Phone Fax Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a step in the right direction Utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be accomplished through amendments to SB X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons c redit risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are imprudent On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to empl oy to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues We have identified three options Amend ABX The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ABX See attached file entitled AmendABXdoc Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through contract amendments Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California s Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle ABX Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways Buydown demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months DWR could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions Enron has developed an online auction software package D eal Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction Negawatts The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding We estimate that we could generate a summer onpeak demand response in excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer onpeak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to time s that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehi cle SBX The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers Ironically ABX takes that important option away from customers and businesses It is critical that ABX be amended to remove th e prohibition against Direct Access Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within months To execute the transition Californ ia should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle ABX Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extend ed period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets For example California c ould amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year perio d In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB Second California can net the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap

Brink CERA Alert CERA Alert Dcember Title California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas Western Energy N American Power N American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry However there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled In the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers Indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions These include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of Californias electric market woes Challenging siting and permitting Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities Price caps discourage investment State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state Repeated rule changes Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development Calls for refunds Despite reports by the Power Exchange the ISO and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development Facility inspections Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed to make a profit Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in In addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest Therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall Encourage new build Supply must be part of the answer This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build While in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself For now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness Stabilize investment climate Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers With the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments If they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response Although originally a feature of Californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of the market Whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment Such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility Avoid continuously tinkering with the market While the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in California Continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since Julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market California needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course Allow for greater environmental flexibility The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions Free PURPA power plants to generate Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end This CERA

Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day This presents enormous challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us individually As we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requir es us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company While we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi n the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair s strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies The belo w mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Jim Steffes The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies Harry Kingerski Enron Broadband Services Sue Nord Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks Lisa Yoho Enron South America Jose Bestard Federal Government Affairs Linda Robertson With the impending retirement on March of Joe Hillings I am pleas ed to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office Lin da was a Congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two Washington law fir ms prior to spending the last eight years with the US Department of Treasury the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison for Secretaries Rubin Summers Linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome additio n to our team In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs groups and strategy in Washington the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und er Joe Hartsoes direction will also report to Linda Joe Hartsoe will als o retain primary responsibility for NERC activities although Charles Yeung a nd Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe s in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the s t quarter of and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group reporti ng to Joe Hartsoe On a personal note I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio ns that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service Joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout Washington I will have more to say about this as Joes retirement draws closer but I look to him to be a v ital part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks I will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government Affairs organization the following changes are being made In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the EES group of companies Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed Government Affairs Support Services This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi ll soon be entering Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati on and report to Harry Jeff Brown Tom Delaney Mary Hain Ron McNamara Christi Nicolay Thane Twiggs and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets Alberto Levy will be relocating from our Caracas Venezuela office and will also report to Jim A couple of special mentions Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job in leading the CUBR Coalition for Uniform Business Rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the US It is also my hope that Steve Walto n will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale electric market issues The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess es of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across North America Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin g the companys efforts at PJM Tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation Kathleen Sullivan has recently joined Steves group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard Fromer in New York Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere while reporting to Sue will continue to provide leadership on telecommunications issues Scott and Donald have done outstanding work and will continue to be integral to our efforts in this area Finally the Resource Commitment Review RCR process beginning wi ll be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America including Federa l Government Affairs and Mexico The RCR Committee beginning immediately will be expanded and will consist of Harry Kingerski Sue Nord Linda Roberston Jim Steffes Lisa Yoho myself Please feel free to call me if you have any questions Thank you
