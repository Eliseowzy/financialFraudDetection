issues matrix from the June meeting that the proposal made by PowerSpring of using actual consumption of enduse customers with AMR devices installed for measuring their compliance with OFOEFOs is not part of the Gas OII Settlement PGE expressed no opinion on the merits of PowerSprings proposal but said it could be raised in the OFO forum PowerSpring explained why we believe this issue is within the scope of the Gas OII Settlement in our prior comments PowerSpring continues to believe that its proposal is within the scope of the current settlement discussions and does not withdraw it from consideration In light of PGEs position however PowerSpring intends to pursue its proposal in the OFO forum and others until it is adopted on satisfactory terms Tod Bradley PowerSpring Inc Original Comment filed June RULE CAPACITY ALLOCATION AND CONSTRAINT OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE PowerSpring Inc previously submitted proposed changes to Rule Sections E F and G to allow use of actual usage data from AMR devices for Core Procurement Groups to determine compliance with and noncompliance charges for OFOEFOs and Involuntary Diversions See Section of comments submitted May PGE responded in of the Resolution Matrix that the Settlement does not contemplate development of meter AMR and meter data handling Two parts of the Settlement Agreement do at least implicitly contemplate usage of actual data in the ways PowerSpring proposes Section states the Commissions belief that customers access to real time data regarding their gas consumption will increase efficiency and provide competitive tools and may help them better manage their pipeline flows The Commission also considers the most promising option is for UDCs to make the equipment technology and training necessary for timely customer access to current consumption information available to customers The Meter AddOn Pilot Program agreed to in Section is one implementation of these Commission policies but customer access to real time consumption information provided by AddOn devices has little value unless the customers and PGE actually use it when it is most needed such as during OFOEFOs Thus the Meter AddOn Pilot and the Commissions policies at least implicitly contemplate that the real time data will be not only made available but will actually be used to enable customers to better manage and balance their gas supplies and consumption particularly during critical times of system stress such as OFOEFOs PowerSprings proposals are a specific way in which those objectives stated in the Settlement Agreement can be met In addition Section of the Settlement Agreement provides for an assessment of the Meter AddOn Pilot Program prior to its completion That assessment will miss a prime opportunity to evaluate how well customers are able to make use of real time data and how the program should be modified to enable them to make better use of the data if they are not allowed to actually use it during the Pilot One of the most significant assessments will be how well customers use the data during critical periods such as OFOEFOs Thus the assessment element in Section of the Settlement Agreement also contemplates develop and use of real time data from AddOn devices in the manner PowerSpring proposes PowerSpring requests PGE to reconsider its response in of the Resolution Matrix Original Message
