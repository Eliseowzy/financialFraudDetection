siemailprofootballextraimageshelmetsdenbronc ossmgif by SIs Peter King After I along with most of the western world declared the Broncos the fav orites in the AFC West this fall theyve now been beaten to the kind of Ge rry Cooney pulp that makes their topflight status quite shaky Theyre the thirdhighest scoring team in their own division for crying out loud Sa n Diego Oakland Denver And quarterback Brian Griese has a b um throwing shoulder he has far less zip on the ball Trouble with a capi tal T especially now that he has to play without Ed McCaffrey Even though the Chargers have lost two straight weeks on the road to beatable Clevelan d and New England you have to like their chances to win at a feverpitched Qualcomm I like Doug Flutie to play big in a big game Flutie and new off ensive coordinator Norv Turner have made some beautiful music together in t he first third of the season which is pretty remarkable considering this i s about the th offense Fluties had to learn since leaving Boston College Its tou gh when you have to keep learning new offenses Flutie tell s me but you have to wipe the slate clean and start fresh A lot of guys carry some baggage when they go from one place to another You say We used to to do it this way or call it such and such and you think of it in tho se terms But you have to erase that Ive been pretty good at doing that And the bottom line here is I believe in Norv Turner and I will try to do it his way Its worked well so far Catch Sports Illustrateds Peter King live from Raymond James Stadium in Ta mpa with the latest football news

You Need to Know by SIs Peter King siemailprofootballextraimagesblackxgif Butch Davis believes just what his old boss in Dallas Jimmy Johnson be lieves when it comes to draft choices In jettisoning a player they were no t using prominently defensive lineman Stalin Colinet to Minnesota the Br owns upgraded a seventhround draft pick to a fifthrounder Now Cleveland has the most picks in the draft of any team in the league but exp ansion Houston With the No pick in next Aprils draft Houston likely will not reach for either of the two toptier quarterbacks available Oregons Joey Harri ngton and Fresno States David Carr My sleeper picks for the Texans Openi ng Day QB Shane Matthews or that kid with the Texas name and California t ude Cade McNown Good for Mike Holmgren Hes not wavering on putting Matt Hasselbeck bac k in the lineup next week at Miami Heres the thing with the Seahawks QB situation Youll never find the upside of Hasselbeck unless you play him Remember it was late in Brett Favres second year as a starter when assist ant coaches on the Green Bay staff urged Holmgren to yank him Hasselbeck n eeds time even with the pennant race on the line Underrated Defensive

siemailprofootballextraimageskirwanxgif siemailprofootballextraimagesblackxgif Unsung Heroes siemailprofootballextraimagesblackxgif by CNNSIcoms Pat Kirwan Wide receiver Hines Ward was supposed to watch two firstround draft picks take over starting roles at his position in Pittsburgh But Plaxico Burress and Troy Edwards havent developed the way Ward has In the past two weeks he has caught balls for yards and a touchdown Meanwhile backup ru nning back Amos Zereoue has been giving the Steelers a change of pace when Jerome Bettis has needed a break In the last two games Zereoue has rushed times for yards In my book that makes him a productive player beh ind the scenes and a guy a number of teams would start if they had him on t heir roster Click here for more of Pat Kirwans Unsung Heroes
