Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged

conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing

Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest

like to get more involved in WSCC issues as I see where Charles and I might be able to provide a lot of value If nothing else it will give me a better perspective for things as we develop them at NERC

Rodriquez Andy Subject RE Portland West Desk Meeting Thanks again Andy for coming out I think it would be a good idea to touch base with Diana She along with Dave Perriono will be most infulential on this stuff going forward In that regard can you email her and me a copy of your presentation from yesterday Alan comnes Original Message From Rodriquez Andy Sent Wednesday September PM To Yeung Charles Cc Nicolay Christi L Lindberg Susan Perrino Dave Comnes Alan Steffes James D Subject Portland West Desk Meeting Charles Greetings from Portland I gave presentations to the West desk on WSCC and the IS ETag ESC business practices OASIS Phase II a second discussion of RTOs and the NAEROEISB debate They are excited about ETag although they recognize it may be delayed seem intrigued by frag scheduling and shared some opinions about the WSCCNERC power struggle NAEROEISB and RTOs in general In summary here is what I have learned here Dave Perrino thinks and I agree that we need to coordinate better perhaps with quarterly visits from you me or the two of us together Im amazed at how things are out here We need to look at getting involved supporting the desk out here as they are really in the beginning of the standardizing process and could probably use some of our expertise I think they would appreciate having access to people like us that are used to duking it out with operators over procedural details We may want to start attending some of the WSCC meetings as well like the ISAS OC and WMIC CAs and TPs dont know how to behave out here A lot of the violations we saw in early tagging such as inconsistent application of rules depending on who was working requiring nonstandard information etc are still very much problems here SusanChristi I think we want to get more involved with fighting some of these jerks as they are really RANDOM out here I told the schedulers to bring me issues that document when we are treated unfairly so we can start calling tariff administrators and ask them what is going on For example a Some people are requiring tags for bus bar only transactions tags exist with only title transfers and end up with dummy transmission inserted to make it a valid tag when they should really just be bookouts b Some entities simply cant meet their tagging requirements WAPA LCs system is constantly down and they refuse to do anything about it Charles this might be a good test for the P Compliance templates c WSCC as a whole does not use the ADJUST feature they force PSEs to retag everything including curtailments thats just silly I have no idea how that developed I dont know where we want to start or how we want to start It might be worth it to plant some straightmen out there from other companies and see if we cant get some of these items brought up in the IS or the TISWG then move them forward through NERC Or it might be more appropriate to deal with the entities directly as Enron with possible intervention form the NERC MIC hotline or the FERC hotline Thoughts General thought is that regardless of what FERC wants there will be three RTOs here for the foreseeable future They feel this is okay as long as we can get standardization within the RTO Perino has been working on a proposal that provides standards ACROSS all RTOs essentially a standard OSS Market interface for the West but right now the desk would settle for different RTOs with seams agreements Longer term goal is one RTO but the CAISO mess may make that unachievable for a while Expectation is that DStar and RTO West will eventually combine either literally or functionally with CAISO off doing its own thing General consensus seems to be that we should push for two organizations EISBE and ESIBW or EERC and WERC or something The people out here seem to think that for several reasons a DC Tie volumes are too low for us to be fight to have standards across them they should be treated like seams If there was more volume then it might be worth the fight but now its just not worth it b People in the West kneejerk against NERC and anything with NERC on it is immediately regarded with suspicion and mistrust c People in the West will have enough trouble just agreeing among themselves not to mention with all of the Eastern entities All in all I think this trip has been very enlightening for both myself and the West desk I think we should definitely continue to work with them and perhaps see if we can facilitate the growth of WSCC into EISBW or whatever they want to call it I think that helping define EISBW might also go a long way toward eroding confidence in NERC as a standards organization and aid us in the move towards unseating them to be replaced with a more balanced organization While I know that way may be dangerous ie if the West doesnt have to follow NERC rules why should we I think that a change of this magnitude is unavoidable This fight has been brewing for a long time and WSCC is probably never going to come into the NERC fold We might as well see if we can figure out how to use that fact to our advantage Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

I have ever heard NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning They have almost no experience dealing with security either cyber or otherwise They are using the terrorist attacks on the th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old YK contingency plans and cash in on peoples fears to strengthen their position In any case I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC Look at NERCs offices They are in a shopping mall How secure is that Last time I visited they didnt even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything the whole place was wide open Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERCs infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers Contrast that with places like ISONE and NYISO who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex Or compare that with the MISOs hardened facility capable of withstanding an F tornado hit You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous Thats akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider a terrorist isnt going to attack a tariff desk market system or security coordinator they will attack nuclear units substations and other installations that actually matter I echo Daves question do we want to call NERC on this issue It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERCs many security failings including some initiatives they are currently sitting on Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud By the way am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this rd grade

MEMORANDUM TO Legislative Affairs Committee Regulatory Affairs Committee NAERO Working Group FROM Scott Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE September RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs The attached email in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press The statements concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs Four RTO policy set forth in its July th Order The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations Specifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint They noted that this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much This event was attributed to the socalled NIMBA virus NERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve played not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to reliability standards They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July th Order Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised It is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at or

urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp
