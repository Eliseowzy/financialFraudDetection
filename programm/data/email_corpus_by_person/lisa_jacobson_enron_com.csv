Steve Kean Linda Robertson Rick Shapiro Catherine McKalipThompson From Lisa Jacobson Re Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change Action in Congress the Administration Date April In the current debate over how the US should approach domestic and international climate change issues focus has increased lately on explorin g voluntary approaches to reduce greenhouse gases President Bush s statements that the US would not impose mandatory CO reductions on power plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the US shou ld not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol which contains actual commitments on emission reductions have driven the discussion about voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result s Two articles attached appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend The first reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle DSD where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new approaches to address climate change including voluntary compliance with greenhouse gas emission reduction goals In response to strong criticism b y environmentalists a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from those remarks and restates his support for binding measures to red uce greenhouse gas emissions Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron s input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs As the Administrations Climate Change Task Force is preparing its recommendations for a new US proposal our input is needed in the next fe w weeks Experience with Voluntary Approaches Back to the Future The US and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through voluntary measures alone It is not yet known whether the Bush Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases However it is unlikely th at a US proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any credibility in the international debate Clearly industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong program but as recent weeks suggest Administration officials have differi ng views on objectives and approaches Below are some recent examples of wh y voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change signed by former President Bush and subsequently ratified by the US Senate developed countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to levels by the year By industrialized countries acknowledged th at they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal and initiated negotiatio ns to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments These negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocols targets and timetables wh ere industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo ut percent below levels between and and the US agreed to a reduction of percent below levels between and On the domestic level the Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo p a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc e greenhouse gas emissions The aim of the b program is to encou rage voluntary emissions reductions While some companies participate in the program it has not yielded significant emissions reductions Companies participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain experience with inventories reporting and verification Many hope to be rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator y program To encourage participation b provides wide flexibility on setting a baseline It also allows for dual reporting of emissions reductions selfcertification of reductions and permits the entity to deci de the level of reporting it undertakes A GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not qualify as real appropriately reviewed and verified emissions redu ctions Congress has been considering how to strengthen the b program for sever al years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla ns ChafeeLieberman Credit for Early Action legislation In the th Congress the debate centered around proposals to help US businesses achieve credit for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases T he legislation never progressed however due to the difficulty in structuring a voluntary program Concerns about granting credit against notyetcreated regulatory regimes difficulty with setting baselines for determining which voluntary actions warrant credit and political problems with links to international commitments all added to the bills demise Opportunities for Enron Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our role as a respected source for information on how to structure marketbased systems for emissions reductions Enron is well situated to provide highlevel input to the Administration and Congress toward developing credible energy and climate change proposals In particular we have a rea l opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses new generation gas energy efficiency emissions trading and risk management while handi ng the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues Enrons input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in real reductions of greenhouse gas emissions while providing full flexibility fo r companies and others to meet clear goals We have already indicated to the Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures could fit into a comprehensive package but will likely fall short of environmental and international expectations The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks and the White Houses Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c hange proposal Jeff and I will develop specific recommendations for the White House and Congress and circulate them with you and relevant Enron commercia l groups We will also incorporate discussion of these issues in an Enronwi de strategy meeting on emissions issues we are planning in May Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions Lisa

Steve Kean Linda Robertson Rick Shapiro Catherine McKalipThompson From Lisa Jacobson Re Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change Action in Congress the Administration Date April In the current debate over how the US should approach domestic and international climate change issues focus has increased lately on explorin g voluntary approaches to reduce greenhouse gases President Bush s statements that the US would not impose mandatory CO reductions on power plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the US shou ld not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol which contains actual commitments on emission reductions have driven the discussion about voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result s Two articles attached appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend The first reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle DSD where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new approaches to address climate change including voluntary compliance with greenhouse gas emission reduction goals In response to strong criticism b y environmentalists a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from those remarks and restates his support for binding measures to red uce greenhouse gas emissions Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron s input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs As the Administrations Climate Change Task Force is preparing its recommendations for a new US proposal our input is needed in the next fe w weeks Experience with Voluntary Approaches Back to the Future The US and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through voluntary measures alone It is not yet known whether the Bush Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases However it is unlikely th at a US proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any credibility in the international debate Clearly industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong program but as recent weeks suggest Administration officials have differi ng views on objectives and approaches Below are some recent examples of wh y voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change signed by former President Bush and subsequently ratified by the US Senate developed countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to levels by the year By industrialized countries acknowledged th at they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal and initiated negotiatio ns to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments These negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocols targets and timetables wh ere industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo ut percent below levels between and and the US agreed to a reduction of percent below levels between and On the domestic level the Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo p a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc e greenhouse gas emissions The aim of the b program is to encou rage voluntary emissions reductions While some companies participate in the program it has not yielded significant emissions reductions Companies participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain experience with inventories reporting and verification Many hope to be rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator y program To encourage participation b provides wide flexibility on setting a baseline It also allows for dual reporting of emissions reductions selfcertification of reductions and permits the entity to deci de the level of reporting it undertakes A GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not qualify as real appropriately reviewed and verified emissions redu ctions Congress has been considering how to strengthen the b program for sever al years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla ns ChafeeLieberman Credit for Early Action legislation In the th Congress the debate centered around proposals to help US businesses achieve credit for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases T he legislation never progressed however due to the difficulty in structuring a voluntary program

international commitments all added to the bills demise Opportunities for Enron Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our role as a respected source for information on

trading regulation yesterday Based on a quick review several changes were made that Enron asked for in its submission earlier this month Specifically OPGs allocations will be partitioned through not Allowances will be allocated on a prospective basis baned on the previous years generation output Estimations of energy production will be used subject to a trueup to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year Direction and distance provisions that would discount emissions reductions credits foreign allowances have been removed The SO set aside for renewable energy and energy efficiency is raised to KT NOx expressed as NO remains at KT There is no restriction on banking of credits ERC credit lifetime extended from five to seven years Approval of ERCs by the Ministry of the Environment before registration of the credits rather than after registration but before use Please see the summary of the regulation below compiled by Lisa DeMarco of Donahue Ernst Young in Toronto Environmental Strategies will analyze the regulation and be back in touch with more information on its impact for Enron Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions Link to MOE summary of regulation changes and links to regulation envregistryerhtm On October the Ontario Minister of Environment released the final emissions trading regulation which includes several significant changes to the draft regulation The release of this regulation and an additional regulation governing emissions from the Lakeview generating station is broadly thought to signify the likely opening of the Ontario electricity market in Spring please see attached article A brief overview of the central aspects of the Ontario emissions trading regulation which sets out a hybrid Cap Credit and Trade system of emissions trading for Ontario follows Applicability Starting in the regulation will apply to Ontario Power Generations OPG fossil fuel generating stations In the requirements will be extended to large MW Independent Power Producers IPPs in the province Most notably the regulation is accompanied by an announcement that caps and the associated hybrid trading scheme will be extended to other major industrial sectors in the near future Consultation with those sectors regarding the level of their sector caps will commence immediately Caps NOx measured as NO An overall cap of KT in will decline to KT in The cap will be partitioned between OPG and IPPs between and Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for KT of setaside allowances Starting in the allocation of allowances will also be subject to a NorthSouth partition to comply with obligations under the Ozone Annex to the Canada US A Air Quality Agreement Trading between these areas is not however restricted SO An overall cap of KT in will decline to KT in The cap will not be partitioned between OPG and IPPs and will apply to OPG facilities in and all large IPPs in Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for KT of setaside allowances Allocation Prospective allocation of allowances will be on the basis of a facilitys prorata share of energy production output in the province OPG will receive a corporate based allocation each year until the end of at which point all allocations will be on a facility basis The proposed mechanism allows for estimations of energy production to be used subject to a trueup to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year Measurement of emissions must be by CEMs or equivalent technology Credit Creation Emission reduction credits credits may be created in accordance with MOE Standard Methods from baseline project emission rates in the year prior to creation Specific requirements are set out in the Ontario Emissions Trading Code OETC Generally credits may be created from any of the following jurisdictions Ontario New York Pennsylvania New jersey Delaware Maryland West Virginia Kentucky Ohio Michigan Indiana Illinois Wisconsin and the District of Columbia with possible sciencebased extension of the eligible jurisdictions In addition US allowances which are issued by these jurisdictions may be acceptable for use as Ontario credits if they meet the requirements set out in the OETC Early action credits may be eligible for use if they meet the requirements of the OETC were submitted for review by the PERT program before July and were created between July and January Credits will be approved for use by the MOE before they are registered on the Emissions Trading Registry Credit and Allowance Use Use of credits is limited to of allowances used for NOx and of allowances used for SO These limits do not apply if the facility is operating under an IMO must run contract All credits will be subject to a environmental discount The ratio of smog season to nonsmog season NOx credits must reflect the same ratio of actual emissions There is no restriction on banking of credits There is no distance and directionality discounting for the eligible jurisdictions Trading There is generally unrestricted trading through the Ontario Emissions Trading Registry

several key political issues related to the Kyoto Protocol Delegates at the Bonn climate change negotiations are expected to work through Saturday to develop additional decisions that will incorporate and give full effect to the agreement It is likely that adoption of some or all of these decisions will be pushed to the next set of negotiations in Morocco this fall Despite the media attention there is a long and complex road ahead to a ratified treaty The major outcome of Bonn is that the road is still being traveled The agreement only covered a subset of key political issues Further developed countries want the US on board and this leaves room for the Bush Administration to offer an alternative though the window of opportunity could close shortly Please see links to several editorials below Impact on Enron Even though the US did not adopt this agreement and the Bush Administration will not support the Kyoto Protocol its impact on Enron as well as other multinationals is unclear The Kyoto Protocol negotiations have been driven by governments and impose mandatory emissions reduction targets on developed country governments that are Parties to the Protocol However industry will have a role in complying with emissions reduction obligations While the European Union has promoted harmonized policies and measures throughout this process the Protocol leaves decisions on implementation of treaty obligations to domestic governments that are Parties to the agreement Presently US companies with operations in countries that are Parties to the Protocol and have obligations under the Protocol could face different standards new greenhouse gas emissions regulations domestic carbon taxes among other options It is too early to tell how these issues will impact competitiveness or whether they will be interpreted as nontariff trade barriers Further only Parties to the Protocol can utilize the marketbased mechanisms under the Protocol emissions trading and projectmechanisms in developing countries through the Clean Development Mechanism and project based mechanisms in other developed countries through Joint Implementation Because the details are not yet worked out it is unclear whether Enron would be able to participate in mechanisms or trading through offices in other countries outside the US It will be important that the US develop linkages with the marketbased mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations The agreement also increased the amount of carbon sinks that can be counted toward meeting a Partys emission reduction target in the first budget period The US was set aside million Mt Cyr in the event that it joins in at a later date Increased carbon accounting has the effect of lowering the burden of the emissions reduction target in the first budget period Of note at the last set of negotiations in The Hague last November the US was close to receiving over Mt Cyr This could contribute to more costly and burdensome reductions in the future for US firms as the US could have a more stringent target to meet Key Provisions of the Political Agreement Please see a summary of major elements of the Bonn agreement below I have also included a detailed summary provided by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change MARKET BASED MECHANISMS Emissions Trading No quantitative limits on the use of the marketbased mechanisms emissions trading CDM or JI The EU retreated on this point No levy imposed on transactions Developing countries had championed levies as a source of financial assistance Seller liability would apply to transactions with a commitment period reserve of either of a Parties total budget more attractive for net buyers or the equivalent of five times its last national inventory more attractive for net sellers This allows Russia to sell its hot air credits Clean Development Mechanism and JI Nuclear power projects are not permitted under the CDM or JI Afforestation and reforestation are the only eligible sequestration projects under the CDM Small project fast track window in the CDM for renewable energy projects MW for efficiency and other projects equivalent to less than GWh per year and for new emitting projects that reduce emissions and with emissions of less than tons per year COMPLIANCE If parties are found in noncompliance their compliance amount for the second commitment period is increased they must formulate an action plan and they are not permitted to participate in emissions trading This language is not legally binding but political pressure to enforce the treaty obligations was likely to be the biggest driver for now The legally binding nature of the compliance regime will be revisited at the

Administrator Christine Whitman spoke separately to reporters yesterday and responded to questions on the agreement reached in Bonn and US climate change policy Of note from Powell President Bush takes global climate change very very seriously Agreement in Bonn is not acceptable to US Bush Administration hopes to release its climate change plan by next set of international climate change meetings Oct Morocco or at future sessions Of note from Whitman Whitman supports the recognition of carbon sinks included in the Bonn agreement The White House climate change task force will meet again in August to develop plan Please also see some reactions from Capitol Hill The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing yesterday on climate change There are some interesting quotes from members in the stories below but mostly from the usual suspects We will have to wait to see if the agreement reached in Bonn will create more momentum for bipartisan action to address climate change this Congress Most feel that next Congress is more realistic While the divide on policy options still exists ie voluntary vs mandatory CO reductions there is wider support for better systems to report of greenhouse gas emissions reductions increases in RD incentives for a broad range of clean energy technologies clean coal renewable fuel cells and carbon sequestration technologies and pilot programs Of note Senator Frank Murkowski criticized the Bonn agreement for excluding nuclear energy projects from the mechanisms Senator Bingaman said that there is a greater willingness to move ahead and that Senators are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the US not having a climate change policy Please let me know if you have any questions US not dodging global warming challenge Powell JAPAN July TOKYO US Secretary of State Colin Powell yesterday defended Americas record on environmental protection and said Washington was not denying its responsibilities by refusing to back the Kyoto pact on global warming In talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi Powell thanked Tokyo for its efforts to bridge the gap between the United States and the European Union on the Kyoto pact but added that Washington could not support the accord as it stands We know that global warming is a challenge The United States is not running away from that challenge Powell told a news conference after meeting Koizumi The president is committed to working with all the nations of the world who are involved in this process to find ways that we can join a consensus at some point in the future but the Kyoto Protocol even what came out at Bonn still is not acceptable to the United States Powell said Four days of highlevel negotiations in Bonn Germany ended this week with a broad package on how to implement the Kyoto accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after Tokyo won latitude on how to reach its targets Tokyos consent has been crucial to bringing the accord into force since US President George W Bush rejected in March the pact saying it would hurt the economy of the worlds biggest polluter Loathe to alienate the United States or to put Japanese companies at a competitive disadvantage Koizumi has sought to lure Washington back to the Kyoto accord even as he promises Japan is committed to seeing it take effect in BRIDGING THE GAP Koizumi reiterated that stance yesterday We are making efforts so that America the European Union and Japan can achieve cooperation he told reporters at his official residence Things are moving that way A Japanese official said Koizumi told Powell he wanted Washington to participate in a constructive way in the future and that Japan was leaving the door open for US cooperation Powell told the news conference that the United States was committed to working toward some framework to address the global warming problem I told the prime minister that President Bush takes global climate change very very seriously he said We want to work with Japan and others toward a global framework that deals effectively with the problem of global warming he said adding that the United States was putting forward ideas on technological initiatives and reviews were under way We have our cabinet members deeply involved in this and hopefully well have new ideas that can be presented at COP a followup meeting of environment ministers in Morocco in October or at other future meetings Powell added Scientists warn that the greenhouse effect caused by pollutant gases trapping heat in Earths atmosphere could cause average temperatures to increase by up to six degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit in the next years with devastating effects on the environment Story by Elaine Monaghan REUTERS NEWS SERVICE US EPAs Whitman likes part of global warming treaty USA July WASHINGTON The Bush administrations top environmental official said yesterday she was pleased the global climate accord reached this week in Germany without US participation allows countries to use their forests and farmland to soak up carbon dioxide emissions We believe theres a lot we can do with that said Christine Todd Whitman who heads the US Environmental Protection Agency referring to the pacts language that permits forests and farmland to be carbonstoring sinks The provision was included in a deal reached by countries in Bonn Germany this week requiring industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by an average percent below levels by Whitman speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill said the Bush administration is working on its own plan for cutting US greenhouse gas emissions and that using forests and farmland to achieve that goal would help That kind of recognition the importance of carbon sinks has real implications for farmers for ranchers and for forestry and gives us the opportunity to work aggressively with a number of our interested parties she said Whitman said one of the concerns the Bush administration had with the original terms of the international treaty was that it did not give countries sufficient credit for their forest and farmland to offset emissions So that was something that held us back for any support of it she said The administration is still worried the revised treaty would hurt the US economy by requiring deep reductions in American emissions while at the same time not requiring developing nations to make any major cuts Whitman said the White House has not set a date certain for finishing its emissionscutting plan but top administration officials will meet in August on the issue after a twomonth hiatus We are looking for things we can do to put into place voluntary efforts that are going to address these global warming issues she said I just dont how quickly well come up with a proposal Whitman rejected charges made by other countries that the Bush administrations position against signing the emissionscutting treaty has isolated the United States We are going to continue to work with the rest of the world she said Were not isolationist Whitman was on Capitol Hill testifying at a Senate hearing in favor of legislation to make the EPA part of the presidents cabinet The United States is one of only about a dozen countries that doesnt have cabinet level or ministerial status for its top environmental agency The other countries on the list include Libya Yemen Qatar Peru and Uzbekistan Whitman said elevating the EPA to the cabinet would make it easier to negotiate with her international counterparts The Bush administration supports the idea as do most members of Congress A vote on the legislation is expected this autumn Story by Tom Doggett REUTERS NEWS SERVICE US senators slam Bush on Kyoto pact others say pact flawed USA July WASHINGTON US Senate Democrats told a senior Bush administration official yesterday that the presidents rejection of the Kyoto world climate change pact was deplorable while at the same hearing a leading Republican said the Kyoto treaty itself was a sham The two sides of the Kyoto debate surfaced at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on what the United States could do to reduce everincreasing emissions of greenhouse gases notably the emissions of carbon dioxide The United States is the biggest emitter of the gases blamed for a gradual increase in temperature that many scientists say threatens to melt polar ice caps raise ocean levels and cause radical changes in weather patterns Skeptics including some conservative Republicans doubt the changes are attributable to manmade causes and think the drastic forecasts are alarmist US BECOMING MORE ISOLATED While the rest of the world celebrated this weeks meetings in Bonn Germany that settled a compromise Kyoto treaty the United States has become more isolated on the issue It was the only major world power to pull out of the pact The Kyoto treaty calls for industrialized states to trim output of greenhouse gases to an average of percent below levels by The pact allows industrialized countries to trade emissions with lessdeveloped ones to meet targets and to use large areas of forests and farmland as carbonstoring sinks to offset emissions reduction goals California Democrat Dianne Feinstein said the United States appeared really backward by removing itself from the global treaty At the same time Alaska Republican Frank Murkowski said the fact that Bonn negotiators rejected nuclear power as a resource to fight global warming showed the inadequacy of the treaty Ignoring nuclear power showed the weakness and fallacy of those basically responsible for the Bonn agenda said Murkowski a longtime proponent of more drilling for oil and natural gas in his home state President George W Bush in March rejected the Kyoto process saying the pacts mandated carbon dioxide emission cuts would harm the American economy while not restricting China and lessdeveloped nations from spewing pollutants Francis Blake deputy secretary of the US Energy Department said Congress should focus its attention on funding new technologies to reduce carbon emissions He deflected the Kyoto treaty criticisms from both sides as ultimately irrelevant Research and development opportunities are the single most effective role that Congress and the administration can play at this time Blake told senators He said ideas on the drawing board would alter forever the debate about emission reductions noting programs in need of federal funding were focused on sequestering carbon dioxide before the gas reached the atmosphere and did any harm Blake said the Bush agenda was mulling options to combat climate change and said a White House task force would issue its opinions on how to attack the problem He did not say when the task force would make public its recommendations US CARBON EMISSIONS GROWING Estimates used by Blake in his testimony showed the nation faces a real problem in reducing carbon emissions The Energy Information Administration is projecting that US carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption will reach million metric tons of carbon equivalent in and continue to rise to million metric tons by an average annual growth rate of percent Blake said We will need a concerted effort to reduce this trend Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman a New Mexico Democrat said it was time to push on with new ideas for battling emissions although he noted the Kyoto pact worked out in Bonn seemed to answer many of Bushs concerns Agreement was reached on rules for the Kyoto Protocol yesterday that include all of the flexibility mechanisms the US government and US industry had long argued were critical to a costeffective strategy Bingaman said He said just last month his panel took testimony from experts that showed China had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as onethird over the past years through increasing efficiency More details for the global climate treaty will be hammered out at an October meeting of world environment ministers in Morocco Story by Patrick Connole REUTERS NEWS SERVICE Los Angeles Times newsnationworldnationladioxidestory July Congress Moves to Follow on Kyoto Environment Lawmakers are caught off guard by other nations decision to deal with problem of global warming without US help Effort to pass legislation to curb emissions is revived By ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writer July WASHINGTON Congressional efforts to combat global warming received an unexpected boost from a decision this week by more than countries to deal with the problem without the United States outside experts and key lawmakers said Tuesday They added that prospects now appear good that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide which scientists say is the chief contributor to global warming The odds are improving that this Congress will deal with the issue before the election said Rep Sherwood L Boehlert RNY a leading environmentalist in his party Several House and Senate members said they were caught off guard when the other countries adopted rules Monday in Bonn to implement the Kyoto Protocol without US participation Bonn surprised people said Sen Joseph I Lieberman DConn The feeling was that if the United States took its football and left the field the game couldnt go forward But the rest of the nations of the world found their own football and they completed the game They left the United States on the sidelines In meetings in Europe last week President Bush cited congressional sentiment as having contributed to his decision to play no role in the development of rules to implement the accord reached in Kyoto Japan The accord called on industrial countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels But sentiment in Congress has changed significantly since the Senate voted to four years ago to direct the president not to sign a binding treaty to limit emissions unless developing countries were required to do the same Bush who has characterized the Kyoto accord as fatally flawed has promised to address the issue of global warming But so far his proposals mainly have involved studying the problem and redirecting funds to underwrite new technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions After meeting with his counterparts in Genoa Italy last week Bush agreed to produce a US strategy to combat climate change by the next meeting of Kyoto participants scheduled for October But on Capitol Hill several efforts to address climate change already are in motion Sen James M Jeffords IVt in his new role as chairman of the Senate Environment Committee is holding the first hearing Thursday on legislation that would regulate four pollutants emitted by power plantsincluding carbon dioxide which scientists consider the major contributor to global warming Bipartisan bills have been introduced in both houses to significantly tighten fuelefficiency standards for sportutility vehicles and light trucks which would reduce carbon dioxide emissions The GOPcontrolled House also has altered its stance on climate change Representatives have voted overwhelmingly to strip language from funding bills that would prohibit federal agencies from spending money to implement the Kyoto accord Even two traditional climatechange skepticsSens Robert C Byrd DWVa and Ted Stevens RAlaskaare cosponsoring a bill that would direct the White House to create an office on climate change and to produce annual strategies to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions Both senators represent states that are major producers of fossil fuels I think theres a greater willingness to go ahead said Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM chairman of the Senate Energy Committee I dont know for certain where the votes are But I believe senators are less and less comfortable with the administrations apparent inability to form a policy Some of that is about whats happening internationally and some of that is what people are hearing from their constituents They agreed that the United States awkwardsome say untenableposition on the sidelines of the Kyoto process is increasing the prospects for congressional action The events in Bonn will accelerate movements that have begun here over the last several months toward doing something to curb American greenhouse gas emissions Lieberman said There has been a growing bipartisan movement to take action even while the Bush administration has been pulling away from the international process It really has been fascinating Eileen Claussen who was assistant secretary of State with responsibility for climate change negotiations in the Clinton administration said she was amazed by the shift in attitudes in the Senate Kyoto was such a dirty word from the end of until now said Claussen now president of the Pew Center of Global Climate Change You could barely go up to the Hill and say Kyoto before You might have been able to say climate change but any real interest in doing something about climate change was only from a very small minority Sen John F Kerry DMass a leader on climate change policy in the Senate said the agreement in Bonn improves the odds that Congress will proceed on climate change legislation albeit in piecemeal fashion I think it increases the pressurenot necessarily to pass a facsimile of the treaty but to embrace individual initiatives that have an impact on emissions Kerry said It will proceed in a stepbystep process The combined effect of those steps he said may be quite significant Still Kerry expressed skepticism that a comprehensive strategy could be passed without leadership from the White House You can legislate to a certain degree but without an administration and the bully pulpit of the presidency its exceedingly difficult to embrace a larger scheme Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said she considered it deplorable and arrogant that the administration turned its back on Kyoto noting that the United States is responsible for about a quarter of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions Theres no question that climate change is the No environmental issue in the United States she said Feinstein said she believes that tightening fuelefficiency standards for SUVs and light trucks is the most important thing that Congress can do in a single stroke Cars and trucks account for about a third of carbon dioxide emissions in this country Jeffords expressed hope that at some point the United States will rejoin the international effort to fight global warming In the meantime he said he will fight for passage of his bill to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants which are responsible for an additional third of US emissions I am hopeful we can get it passed in the Senate Jeffords said Its not going to be easy if the White House pulls out all the stops in opposition Earlier this year Bush reversed a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants then pulled out of the Kyoto accord Preliminary government estimates show that carbon dioxide emissions a major contributor to global

Steve Kean Linda Robertson Rick Shapiro Catherine McKalipThompson From Lisa Jacobson Re Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change Action in Congress the Administration Date April In the current debate over how the US should approach domestic and international climate change issues focus has increased lately on explorin g voluntary approaches to reduce greenhouse gases President Bush s statements that the US would not impose mandatory CO reductions on power plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the US shou ld not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol which contains actual commitments on emission reductions have driven the discussion about voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result s Two articles attached appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend The first reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle DSD where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new approaches to address climate change including voluntary compliance with greenhouse gas emission reduction goals In response to strong criticism b y environmentalists a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from those remarks and restates his support for binding measures to red uce greenhouse gas emissions Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron s input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs As the Administrations Climate Change Task Force is preparing its recommendations for a new US proposal our input is needed in the next fe w weeks Experience with Voluntary Approaches Back to the Future The US and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through voluntary measures alone It is not yet known whether the Bush Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases However it is unlikely th at a US proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any credibility in the international debate Clearly industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong program but as recent weeks suggest Administration officials have differi ng views on objectives and approaches Below are some recent examples of wh y voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change signed by former President Bush and subsequently ratified by the US Senate developed countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to levels by the year By industrialized countries acknowledged th at they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal and initiated negotiatio ns to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments These negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocols targets and timetables wh ere industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo ut percent below levels between and and the US agreed to a reduction of percent below levels between and On the domestic level the Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo p a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc e greenhouse gas emissions The aim of the b program is to encou rage voluntary emissions reductions While some companies participate in the program it has not yielded significant emissions reductions Companies participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain experience with inventories reporting and verification Many hope to be rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator y program To encourage participation b provides wide flexibility on setting a baseline It also allows for dual reporting of emissions reductions selfcertification of reductions and permits the entity to deci de the level of reporting it undertakes A GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not qualify as real appropriately reviewed and verified emissions redu ctions Congress has been considering how to strengthen the b program for sever al years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla ns ChafeeLieberman Credit for Early Action legislation In the th Congress the debate centered around proposals to help US businesses achieve credit for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases T he legislation never progressed however due to the difficulty in structuring a voluntary program Concerns about granting credit against notyetcreated regulatory regimes difficulty with setting baselines for determining which voluntary actions warrant credit and political problems with links to international commitments all added to the bills demise Opportunities for Enron Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our role as a respected source for information on how to structure marketbased systems for emissions reductions Enron is well situated to provide highlevel input to the Administration and Congress toward developing credible energy and climate change proposals In particular we have a rea l opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses new generation gas energy efficiency emissions trading and risk management while handi ng the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues Enrons input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in real reductions of greenhouse gas emissions while providing full flexibility fo r companies and others to meet clear goals We have already indicated to the Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures could fit into a comprehensive package but will likely fall short of environmental and international expectations The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks and the White Houses Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c hange proposal Jeff and I will develop specific recommendations for the White House and Congress and circulate them with you and relevant Enron commercia l groups We will also incorporate discussion of these issues in an Enronwi de strategy meeting on emissions issues we are planning in May Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions Lisa

Steve Kean Linda Robertson Rick Shapiro Catherine McKalipThompson From Lisa Jacobson Re Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change Action in Congress the Administration Date April In the current debate over how the US should approach domestic and international climate change issues focus has increased lately on explorin g voluntary approaches to reduce greenhouse gases President Bush s statements that the US would not impose mandatory CO reductions on power plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the US shou ld not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol which contains actual commitments on emission reductions have driven the discussion about voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result s Two articles attached appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend The first reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle DSD where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new approaches to address climate change including voluntary compliance with greenhouse gas emission reduction goals In response to strong criticism b y environmentalists a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from those remarks and restates his support for binding measures to red uce greenhouse gas emissions Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron s input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs As the Administrations Climate Change Task Force is preparing its recommendations for a new US proposal our input is needed in the next fe w weeks Experience with Voluntary Approaches Back to the Future The US and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through voluntary measures alone It is not yet known whether the Bush Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases However it is unlikely th at a US proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any credibility in the international debate Clearly industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong program but as recent weeks suggest Administration officials have differi ng views on objectives and approaches Below are some recent examples of wh y voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change signed by former President Bush and subsequently ratified by the US Senate developed countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to levels by the year By industrialized countries acknowledged th at they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal and initiated negotiatio ns to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments These negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocols targets and timetables wh ere industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo ut percent below levels between and and the US agreed to a reduction of percent below levels between and On the domestic level the Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo p a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc e greenhouse gas emissions The aim of the b program is to encou rage voluntary emissions reductions While some companies participate in the program it has not yielded significant emissions reductions Companies participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain experience with inventories reporting and verification Many hope to be rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator y program To encourage participation b provides wide flexibility on setting a baseline It also allows for dual reporting of emissions reductions selfcertification of reductions and permits the entity to deci de the level of reporting it undertakes A GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not qualify as real appropriately reviewed and verified emissions redu ctions Congress has been considering how to strengthen the b program for sever al years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla ns ChafeeLieberman Credit for Early Action legislation In the th Congress the debate centered around proposals to help US businesses achieve credit for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases T he legislation never progressed however due to the difficulty in structuring a voluntary program Concerns about granting credit against notyetcreated regulatory regimes difficulty with setting baselines for determining which voluntary actions warrant credit and political problems with links to international commitments all added to the bills demise Opportunities for Enron Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our role as a respected source for information on how to structure marketbased systems for emissions reductions Enron is well situated to provide highlevel input to the Administration and Congress toward developing credible energy and climate change proposals In particular we have a rea l opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses new generation gas energy efficiency emissions trading and risk management while handi ng the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues Enrons input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in real reductions of greenhouse gas emissions while providing full flexibility fo r companies and others to meet clear goals We have already indicated to the Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures could fit into a comprehensive package but will likely fall short of environmental and international expectations The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks and the White Houses Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c hange proposal Jeff and I will develop specific recommendations for the White House and Congress and circulate them with you and relevant Enron commercia l groups We will also incorporate discussion of these issues in an Enronwi de strategy meeting on emissions issues we are planning in May Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions Lisa

were on the conference call last week like Elliot Mainzer and Stacey Bolton working on the Renewable Power Desk as well as Heather Mitchell working with EES GHG Prices and the Dupont Transaction I spoke to Natsource regarding the Dupont transaction As expected they could not release the price per ton but said that they are currently accepting bids at pounds per ton COe and offers at pounds per ton COe The Dupont transaction was a forward trade of UK greenhouse gas emissions allowances Dupont expects to be able to reduce their emissions beyond their obligation under the program and thus to be able transfer surplus allowances Also you may find the website below of interest specifically their analysis on carbon prices Please feel free to use my log in ID ID lisa PW lisaj Given all the uncertainty I would not rely too much on the figures indexphp Sainsburys and Monetizing GHG Benefits Other things to think about with regard to participation in the UK climate change programs has Sainsburys done any of the following which would grant them allocations under the trading program signed on to the climate change levy undertaken or considering undertaking a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction target under the direct entry program A third way to monetize the greenhouse gas benefits would be through the climate change auction where mitigation projects are submitted to the UK government for approval and then once approved be permitted to generate credits for sale under the trading program As I understand it the project approval criteria has not yet been agreed to I have heard that timing on the rules is likely next year Certainly Louis Diana and others who are watching this closely can provide additional insights Understanding Sainsburys strategy would help to identify any additional rolesopportunities for Enron Finally it is important to consider any additional costs that may derive from new reporting verification and certification requirements under the emissions trading program Depending on the contract sellers of COe credits are often asked to pay for the reporting etc Please keep me posted as your discussions progress and let me know if I may be of further assistance All the best Lisa Snapshot of Enron Business Activity Related to Greenhouse Gas Emissions Enron Energy Services Managements goal for this year in the US and the UK is to include broad language in standard contracts that capture ownership of the greenhouse gas and other environmental attributes of its deals Key barriers are EES customers cannot easily quantify or in some cases do not understand the potential value of environmental attribute credits Customers do not want to give something away for free and EES does not want to hold up deals However EES has recently closed a deal with Sainsburys a large supermarket chain in the UK and is exploring with Sainsburys participation in the UK greenhouse gas trading program in Enron Europe EE is gearing up to participate in the UKs renewable energy and greenhouse gas credit trading systems as well as the European greenhouse gas emissions trading program Also EE is looking to take a long position on renewable energy credits through the development of renewable energy generating units in UK Greece and Spain Enron Global Markets Coal and Emissions Desk The emissions desk expresses general interest in greenhouse gas emissions trading but an established market is months if not years away In the meantime the desk seeks opportunities to gain experience with greenhouse gas transactions but has not taken a position or been a party to a transaction yet Enron Wholesale Services The Renewable Energy Power Desk has recently closed a significant deal with Andrews Air Force base and is working with other Enron businesses to build a network to transact more deals and to attract customers While the desk provides renewable energy credits these credits will potentially have a larger customer base when the rules for greenhouse gas emissions trading are defined Enron Global ServicesEnron Transportation Services ETS has participated in the US Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star Natural Gas Leak Repair Program ETS has considered capturing and possibly selling methane emissions reductions as carbon dioxide equivalent reductions that derive from the leak repairs of its US assets Enron Global Services is looking into packing and selling methane reductions from similar projects in Argentina If successful this could be replicable at other international pipelines Enron Wind Contract language exists to capture greenhouse gas credits To date Enron Wind has a megawatt project in Honduras that is expected to sell its greenhouse gas credits Portland General Electric PGE participates in EPAs b Greenhouse Gas Voluntary Reporting Program PGE reports about million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent reductions annually and has reported about million tons for projects dating back to Half are from demand side management programs and half are from power plant efficiency upgrades The projects are granted a cumulative life of years for their returns For the next years or so PGE will continue to report million tons annually in addition to any projects or efforts that are completed during the report year PGE has reported since the inception of the program and seeks credit from the US government for

Sent Tuesday October AM To Tripp Garrett Wilson Jan Jacobson Lisa Subject Pollution trading system on hold Lisa can you please forward to Stacy and Mary if requiredthanks Pollution trading system on hold US criticizes Ontario plan John Spears Proposals that would put a price tag on the right to pollute in Ontario and create a market for trading those rights have gone back to the drawing board The provinces plans have drawn comments from many quarters including a detailed and critical response from the US government Pollution blows both ways across the the CanadaUS border But can both countries agree on a system of trading pollution credits which are meant to be a tool for cleaning up North Americas air The environment ministry will pore over the comments to see if the proposed system for trading harmful emissions should be changed Ministry spokesperson John Steele couldnt say how long the review would take The provinces proposals cover emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide two gases that cause smog In theory emissions trading systems set strict ceilings on overall emissions of pollutants and slowly squeeze the limits lower over time Polluters are given an overall target say a per cent reduction in emissions of a specific substance Some polluters may find it cheap and easy not only to meet that target but to exceed it Others who may have older equipment or are in a different business may struggle to meet the goal An emissions trading system allows a company that beat its target to sell surplus pollution credits to the company that fell short The price is set by the buyers and sellers The economic theory is that as long as the overall emission reduction target is achieved it makes sense to do it at the least cost A trading system means that the lowestcost solutions are implemented first While it means that some firms continue to pollute they must pay a price for it That drives up their costs and prods them to clean up Will it work in practice Initially Ontarios proposals would apply only to the six fossilfuel burning plants owned by Ontario Power Generation The proposal details a steady reduction in their emissions Ontario system too complicated says US environmental agency The proposals have attracted keen interest from the US Environmental Protection Agency It has submitted closely spaced pages criticizing the Ontario plan The EPA doesnt believe the methods Ontario proposes for measuring emissions are effective Measuring emissions is crucial if reductions are to be assigned a real value That and other technical problems call into question the compatibility of the proposed trading system for Ontario and US trading programs the EPA says Since pollution blows across international boundaries emissions reduction credits will also be traded across the border Its in our interest to work together with the US says John Wellner of Pollution Probe Steele says thats what Ontario is trying to do Its the intention to harmonize our trading system to allow crossborder trading Were currently in discussion with the US to reach agreement that makes crossborder trading in emission reduction credits a reality But Steele notes its a twoway street At present he says legislation in the US doesnt permit the type of crossborder trading contemplated by Ontario so theres work to do on both sides of the border Pete Christich a USCanada relations officer with the EPA says his agency takes the Ontario proposals seriously We felt the comments are very important regarding the USCanada relations and goals we have under the major air quality agreements our two countries have he said in an interview We really really feel strongly we want to maintain a very close dialogue with Ontario The EPA comments say that Ontarios proposals are unnecessarily complex For example the value of credits would vary depending on the distance between buyer and seller A company selling credits to a polluter right next door would get full value for its credits But if it sells to a polluter kilometres distant the value of the credit would be discounted per cent The EPA says this kind of feature would make the Ontario proposal complicated potentially difficult to implement and may be burdensome to administer Wellner at Pollution Probe gives the ministry credit for proposing tight shrinking limits for emissions in the electricity sector Thats good Were further ahead than we were But he notes that industries outside the electricity sector will also be able to earn credits and theyre not subject to overall caps A metal smelter for example might earn credits for reducing the amount of sulphur dioxide it emits for each tonne of metal produces But if it produces more tonnes of metal the total amount of pollution it emits may actually increase under the current proposal Wellner says The ministry acknowledges that emissionscredit trading is a tool that by itself does not lead to reductions in total emissions The last point is the key as the ministry examines the comments it has received from the EPA and other groups Wellner says We have to ensure that it fits into a framework that ensures overall emissions are reduced

trading regulation yesterday Based on a quick review several changes were made that Enron asked for in its submission earlier this month Specifically OPGs allocations will be partitioned through not Allowances will be allocated on a prospective basis baned on the previous years generation output Estimations of energy production will be used subject to a trueup to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year Direction and distance provisions that would discount emissions reductions credits foreign allowances have been removed The SO set aside for renewable energy and energy efficiency is raised to KT NOx expressed as NO remains at KT There is no restriction on banking of credits ERC credit lifetime extended from five to seven years Approval of ERCs by the Ministry of the Environment before registration of the credits rather than after registration but before use Please see the summary of the regulation below compiled by Lisa DeMarco of Donahue Ernst Young in Toronto Environmental Strategies will analyze the regulation and be back in touch with more information on its impact for Enron Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions Link to MOE summary of regulation changes and links to regulation envregistryerhtm On October the Ontario Minister of Environment released the final emissions trading regulation which includes several significant changes to the draft regulation The release of this regulation and an additional regulation governing emissions from the Lakeview generating station is broadly thought to signify the likely opening of the Ontario electricity market in Spring please see attached article A brief overview of the central aspects of the Ontario emissions trading regulation which sets out a hybrid Cap Credit and Trade system of emissions trading for Ontario follows Applicability Starting in the regulation will apply to Ontario Power Generations OPG fossil fuel generating stations In the requirements will be extended to large MW Independent Power Producers IPPs in the province Most notably the regulation is accompanied by an announcement that caps and the associated hybrid trading scheme will be extended to other major industrial sectors in the near future Consultation with those sectors regarding the level of their sector caps will commence immediately Caps NOx measured as NO An overall cap of KT in will decline to KT in The cap will be partitioned between OPG and IPPs between and Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for KT of setaside allowances Starting in the allocation of allowances will also be subject to a NorthSouth partition to comply with obligations under the Ozone Annex to the Canada US A Air Quality Agreement Trading between these areas is not however restricted SO An overall cap of KT in will decline to KT in The cap will not be partitioned between OPG and IPPs and will apply to OPG facilities in and all large IPPs in Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for KT of setaside allowances Allocation Prospective allocation of allowances will be on the basis of a facilitys prorata share of energy production output in the province OPG will receive a corporate based allocation each year until the end of at which point all allocations will be on a facility basis The proposed mechanism allows for estimations of energy production to be used subject to a trueup to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year Measurement of emissions must be by CEMs or equivalent technology Credit Creation Emission reduction credits credits may be created in accordance with MOE Standard Methods from baseline project emission rates in the year prior to creation Specific requirements are set out in the Ontario Emissions Trading Code OETC Generally credits may be created from any of the following jurisdictions Ontario New York Pennsylvania New jersey Delaware Maryland West Virginia Kentucky Ohio Michigan Indiana Illinois Wisconsin and the District of Columbia with possible sciencebased extension of the eligible jurisdictions In addition US allowances which are issued by these jurisdictions may be acceptable for use as Ontario credits if they meet the requirements set out in the OETC Early action credits may be eligible for use if they meet the requirements of the OETC were submitted for review by the PERT program before July and were created between July and January Credits will be approved for use by the MOE before they are registered on the Emissions Trading Registry

Trading Futures in Dirty Air Heres a MarketBased Way to Fight Global Warming By Ricardo Bayon Sunday August Page B Gary Payne and Jeremy Taylor are two Wall Street types who work for trading companies in respectively Kansas City and Houston Their daily routine i s familiar to speculative traders everywhere They wake up early to get a j ump on the markets read the industry papers take a look at their companie s trading portfolios and log onto their Bloomberg terminals to see whos buying and whos selling But they do not trade in stocks bonds currencie s or even pork bellies Instead what Payne and Taylor trade is the right t o pollute specifically the governmentgiven right to emit sulfur dioxid e SO and nitrogen oxides the two gases chiefly responsible for acid rai n In a classic example of doing well by doing good successful traders such a s Payne and Taylor buy pollution credits low sell them high and make money all the while playing an integral role in a system that has reduced ann ual emissions of SO by US utilities by percent since Their expe rience offers a valuable lesson for US policy makers seeking solutions to the problem of global climate change The sulfur dioxide market provides a businessfriendly marketoriented costeffective model for reducing emis sions of carbon dioxide the gas generally considered to be the main culpri t behind global warming The market is based on the same theory as the countrytocountry emissions trading program envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol signed by countries an d rejected by President Bush But the president should not be put off by th is Pollutioncredit trading is an inherently capitalist approach to the gl obal warming problem that can be set up nationally or regionally with Can ada and Mexico and can be tailored to US needs Perhaps the administration needs to be reminded of the successes of the SO program It was created to combat acid rain one of the major environmenta l issues of the s Acid rain is caused when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted into the atmosphere mostly by power generators In Congress amended the Clean Air Act to set national targets for emissions of those gases it then instructed the Environmental Protection Agency EP A to allocate the rights to these limited emissions among major US utili ties and to create a mechanism for the utilities to buy and sell those rig hts Note that the government did not tell utilities how to reduce their em issions of SO It merely set targets and let the market determine how best to achieve this goal So under the EPA plan a power plant that was emitt ing too much sulfur dioxide had several options It could install less poll uting technology it could switch its fuel from coal to natural gas which produces less SO or it could purchase excess emission credits from anoth er utility A utility that upgraded its technology or switched fuels might even cover some of the costs by selling emission credits it no longer neede d Trading in sulfur dioxide rights got fully underway in and in nitroge n oxides some years later Today the right to emit SO sells for around a ton and is sold in lots of tons which means it is available to anyone with half a million dollars to spare The big buyers and sellers ar e utilities and energy companies but there are exceptions The venerable W all Street brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald once helped a wealthy benefacto r purchase the right to emit one ton of SO as a wedding present for a pair of environmentalists and it brokered a deal for an environmental group th at wanted to give its retirees emission rights instead of gold watches Taylor who tracks the market closely says that in the past year about million worth of SO credits changed hands He points out however that if the trading in SO options and futures is included the total market is several times that size You can buy SO puts calls straddles call spre ads whatever you need he says And this robust and liquid market is not just profitable it also has been remarkably effective at controlling acid rain According to the EPA which tracks the emissions of of the largest power plants in the country the y emitted million tons of SO in when Congress first mandated a c ap That figure dropped to million tons by But in when trad ing in SO credits began emissions plummeted to million tons even tho ugh power generation continued to increase In the Northeast and MidAtlant ic regions of the United States where acid rain and lake acidification wer e particularly problematic acid rain levels declined by percent between and The cost to businesses of this environmental benefit was barely more than a tenth of what had originally been predicted Before Congress mandated the sulfur dioxide cap the Edison Electric Institute estimated that it would c ost billion a year for industry to meet its targets over the ensuing decade successive studies by a variety of groups have shown that the real figure is likely to be closer to million a year In other words the SO market is doing what markets do best It has wrung inefficiencies out of the system and allocated scarce resources in this ca se pollution rights very costeffectively Markets can do the same thing for carbon dioxide But this will require of President Bush and Congress at least one act of political courage They wil l need to cap CO emissions Bush pledged to do so during his campaign but later reversed his stance Now he would have to reverse the reversal but he can find inspiration in his father the first President Bush who se administration launched the successful SO trading program Besides the gesture might not be as difficult as it looks because when it comes to greenhouse gases business is way ahead of government A quiet gray market already exists in carbon dioxide Individual companies expec ting some kind of government regulation in the nottoodistant future have been buying and selling CO credits for more than three years If you are a large power company spending millions of dollars building pla nts that you expect to operate for or years says CO trader Carlton Bartels you are not happy when government comes along and tells you not to worry about global warming at least not for the next four years That d oesnt decrease the risks your company faces as a result of climate change It may actually increase them Bartels is chief executive officer of COecom a carbon dioxide trading fi rm that was spun off from Cantor Fitzgerald six months ago The new company helps businesses prepare for what Bartels calls the inevitable carboncon strained future when public pressure will force governments to regulate emissions of the gases that cause climate change In the meantime COecom is busy arranging trades for companies that want to stay ahead of the curve For exampleHoustonbased Petro Source Carbon C o has constructed a pipeline that takes the carbon dioxide produced by fou r US power plants and pumps it into new oil wells in west Texas where it enhances oil recovery Since the CO it uses would otherwise be vented int o the atmosphere Petro Source figures it will have carbon credits to spare if and when the United States puts a cap on CO emissions Meanwhile Onta rio Power Generation of Toronto whose plants emit carbon dioxide expects Canada to institute a similar cap In a deal brokered by COecom Ontario Power recently bought million tons of Petro Sources credits Both part ies expect their governments to honor the deal in the future Bartels estimates that in its short lifetime COecom has been involved in trades for the equivalent of million tons of CO emissions rights eac h ton selling for between and a ton A ton of carbon dioxide is much cheaper than a ton of sulfur dioxide in part because trade in CO is stil l highly speculative If governments institute CO emissions caps these pr ices should skyrocket Even before COecom was created he said Cantor F itzgerald helped move between million and million tons of CO emissio ns rights By the end of this decade Bartels believes that the CO market could be wo rth tens of billions of dollars Given the amount of global emissions he says this could become the largest commodity market in the world As President Bush seeks a coherent policy on climate change he would do we ll to realize that Wall Street power companies and emissions traders have for years been sitting on an elegant not to mention profitable soluti on to his problems The s may have taught us that greed is not always g ood but the decade to come is likely to show that it can

hearing Thanks German industry slams EU emissions trading plan GERMANY August FRANKFURT The German energy industry was firmly at loggerheads with government and European Commission officials Tuesday over plans to introduce an EU statewide companybased emissions trading system by Emissions trading buying and selling the right to pollute is one of the measures suggested by the UNsponsored deal agreed in Kyoto in to help industrialized countries cut greenhouse gases GHGs linked to climate change The Commission is working on a draft emissions trading directive which it aims to present by the end of the year We have been formally involved in talks but none of the industrys comments have been taken into account in the EUs draft directive on emissions trading Eberhard Meller head of the association of German power suppliers VDEW told delegates at a Euroforum conference in Frankfurt Germanys own emissions trading working group aims to present a model for carbon dioxide CO emissions trading by September and put a draft law before parliament in December CO from fossil fuel combustion is the easiest of the six GHGs to monitor and accounts for percent of them It is thus the most suited to start off trading said the Environment Minstrys Franzjosef Schafhausen who heads the working group An outstanding issue in the EUs plan the Commissions Peter Zapfel said is whether participation in emissions trading should be mandatory or voluntary German industry opposes a mandatory companybased approach as running counter to its existing voluntary commitment to reduce CO emissions and insists a global countrybased scheme would offer greater incentives to participate Christof Bauer of German chemicals firm Degussa dismissed Schafhausens warning that companies that do not participate in trading could face an increase in Germanys existing ecotax while those that do could have it removed Why should I have to make a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea Maybe I am bit behind the moon but I dont see any dirty dealing like that happening he said There is a stark contrast in the working group industry sources said between the environment ministry which supports the EUwide company scheme and the economics ministry and a large part of industry that want a countrybased system We prefer an EUwide company based scheme because it will mean a cost saving of one third compared with implementing emissions trading on a national level Zapfel said But Joachim Hein of industrial consumers group BDI argued that Kyoto itself calls for national emissions caps ET at a company level would ruin the Kyoto Protocol in fact since international industries fear they will have to comply with stateoftheart technologies or be punished Degussas Bauer added that with a company scheme international companies would simply move their emissions to countries where it was cheaper to emit VDEW BDI and Degussa said they want to be allowed to work with the current tool kit the voluntary commitment eco tax and laws designed to support combined heat and power CHP generation and the use of renewable energies The government agreed with industry in June to target a million tonne cut in CO by through CHP use as part of a total million tonnesyear reduction target This is not a oneway agreement the federal government guaranteed it will not try to take any regulatory steps to achieve these voluntary targets VDEWs Meller said The associations and Degussa called instead for a test phase of voluntary participation in emissions trading REUTERS NEWS SERVICE German HEW urges industry to back emissions trading GERMANY August FRANKFURT Hamburgbased utility HEW spoke as a lone voice within Germanys energy industry yesterday in its support for emissions trading the market tool that allows companies to buy and sell the right to pollute German energy industry associations had earlier criticised the European Commissions plan to introduce an EUwide companybased scheme by as conflicting with their existing voluntary commitments to reduce emissions We get enquiries from rating agencies on how we will manage our environmental risk since it could affect the rating they give us and the funding we receive from banks HEWs head of future energy concepts HelmuthMichael Groscurth told delegates at a Euroforum conference in Frankfurt The cost of carbon over the next decade could be as high as to per tonne and you need a tool to hedge against that risk Emissions trading was proposed by the UNsponsored Kyoto Protocol in to help industrialised countries cut greenhouse gases chiefly carbon dioxide that have been linked to climate change Germanys target of a percent cut in GHGs from levels by forms most of the EUs Protocol commitment Groscurth said it was too much of risk to see if Germany could achieve that target by voluntary commitment alone He defended the proposed setting of absolute targets on companies in place of existing agreed reduction goals Kyotos absolute reduction goal for Germany isnt going to change so we have to have absolute limits on company emissions And it isnt a choice between emissions trading or nothing but a case of trading along with other reduction measures HEW concluded the first transatlantic emissions trading deal last year when it sold emissions rights to Canadas biggest investorowned power generator TransAlta It also did a deal with an Australian firm to buy rights The TransAlta deals volumes were so small that it will not affect Germanys target but we did the the Australian deal in the same price range of cents to per tonne of CO and even made a profit on it Groscurth said Germany should not believe that because the worlds biggest polluter the United States had pulled out of the Kyoto pact US firms were not preparing for emissions trading he added A lot is happening in the US at the state and company level and once they are fit the US government will take notice Then the US will overtake us and we will have to play by their rules he said Groscurth also noted plans to set up a Chicago Climate Exchange with a budget of Joachim Hein of the German industrial consumer group BDI said its members were sceptical about the role of emissions verifiers in the Commissions emissions trading plan I could see firms simply having to make a declaration on emissions levels which would be monitored just like a companys balance sheet is monitored by independent auditors with spot checks like on income tax returns Groscurth said He supported the German emissions trading working groups aim to distribute most emissions certificates under a system of free allocation according to historical emissions or grandfathering and in lesser part by auction A large share by grandfathering would avoid a high threshold for entry into trading while an auction would give a price signal and allow new companies to get involved he said REUTERS NEWS SERVICE Lisa Jacobson Enron Manager Environmental Strategies Eye Street

State to r educe carbon dioxide emissions I am awaiting more information from Suffolk County and more information on which entities this would impact as well as the scale of the reductions Please let me know if you have any questions Analysis of New York Legislation and Action on Carbon Regulation Background Government interest in addressing local air pollution and global warming ha s led to several initiatives in New York to reduce carbon dioxide emissions CO CO is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change In the absence of a national US approach to reduce greenhouse gas emiss ions several states and municipalities mostly in the Northeast have pass ed legislation or initiated programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emiss ions Currently the US Congress and the Bush Administration are conside ring domestic plans to address climate change However in contrast to sta tements made during the presidential campaign President Bush has said that he would not support mandatory regulation of CO at power plants under fed eral programs to regulate multiple pollutants NOx SO and mercury or to combat climate change Several moderate and Northeastern Republicans as we ll as many Democrats support inclusion of CO in multipollutant plans The US Senate will likely consider climate change legislation and could cons ider multipollutant legislation before the end of the year Hearings are u nderway and several bills have been introduced but the timing on Senate f loor consideration is uncertain The US House of Representatives is not moving as fast on either issue making the adoption of a national climate c hange plan or new federal regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions a t least a year or more likely several years away Suffolk County Legislation to Reduce CO Emissions from Power Plants In late July Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney signed legislation to regulate CO emissions from electric generating units and steam generating units in Suffolk County with a capacity of more than megawatts This i s the first of such measures adopted in NY state and will go into effect in March Quarterly reporting is required and Suffolks Division of th e Environment will issue rules by October The initial allowable emission rate would be pounds of CO per MWh I n each subsequent year the rate would be reduced by for each MW of new generating capacity added in the county until a reduction has been achieved Power plant owners could comply by upgrading equipment switchin g from oil to gas purchasing CO credits or investing in energy efficienc y or renewables If they failed to comply plant owners would be fined per ton of CO above the limits in the first year and ton in following years Most of the plants on Long Island were built by Long Island Lighting and ac quired in by KeySpan Energy when LILCO merged the generation and gas p ortions of its business with Brooklyn Union Gas to form KeySpan KeySpan h as about MW in Suffolk County including two big steam stations and s ome combustion turbines Some say that KeySpan could meet the target by re powering its steam plants to combined cycle However according to KeySpa n that could require coming off line for up to a year which in Suffolks t ight energy market would be disrupting According to the County there are several new natural gas merchant plants under development that would also be required to meet the standard Industry met with the County officials a nd substantial revisions to the legislation were made Emissions trading is permitted and press reports indicate that credits can be generated inside or outside of Suffolk County I am looking to confirm this as initial drafts of the bill stated that credits must be generated in Suffolk County Rules for quantifying emissions credits have not yet be en set Issues for Enron Will this have an impact on long term power contracts in Suffolk County Does EES have customers in Suffolk County that could generate credits under the program If credits can be generated by uncapped sources or sources outside of Suffo lk County does Enron have credits to sell New York State Assembly Multipollutant Bill In late June the New York Assembly passed a bill that would regulate emiss ions of NOx SO and CO from electric generators of MW capacity or lar ger The bill requires the Department of Environmental Conservation DEC t o adopt regulations implementing reductions in emissions of CO by January and requires the DEC to establish a cap on total emissions of CO equivalent to emission levels by January The State Senate is also considering multipollutant legislation but is not expected to pass companion legislation Consensus does not exist in the S enate on regulation of CO Further observers feel that the crafters are not fully aware of the implic ations of these bills increasing the likelihood that they will not move fu rther anytime soon Governors Climate Change Task Force In early June NY Governor George Pataki today announced the formation of a Greenhouse Gas Task Force to develop policy recommendations for greenhouse gas emissions and global warming The Task Force is comprised of represent atives from the business community environmental organizations state agen cies and universities Pataki has been outspoken on calling on the federal government to take acti on on multipollutant plans and has encouraged the inclusion of CO The Task Force will report back to Governor Pataki with specific policy rec ommendations on or before November The recommendation will be co nsidered for inclusion in a draft state energy plan to be completed in Dece mber A final report from the Task Force is due by March and the final energy plan will be released in the Spring of The Task Force is just getting underway and its members have divergent vie ws on whether to regulate CO Two subgroups exist one that deals with re gistries and trading brokers marketers some NGOS and industry and the o ther deals with power plants mostly power generators At this time the power plant group tends to oppose mandatory CO regulatio n while the registry and trading subgroup is more supportive of it NYC Council Proposal to Reduce CO Emissions The NY City Council is considering legislation to regulate CO as well Si milar in some fashion to the Suffolk County bill it would require power ge nerators greater than MW to reduce CO eventually leading to a redu ction from levels The regulation would apply to units operating in Newer units wi ll not be part of the overall reduction but must

Administrations appointee picks This is a good survey article EnergyIndustrys Links to Regulators Administration Worry Environmentalists By James V Grimaldi Washington Post Staff Writer Monday September Page E Is the Bush administration plotting to drop lawsuits against electricity generators accused of polluting the air in violation of the Clean Air Act Thats the fear of environmental groups as power companies rev up the lobbying turbines and some politically connected lawyers take key positions in the administration Are these attorneys in place to execute a payback for the million that electric utilities gave according to the Center for Responsive Politics to George W Bush and Republicans last year One of the key issues involves a part of the Clean Air Act that permitted existing power plants to exceed the amount of pollution they disgorged into the air if the plants were in existence or grandfathered when the act was updated However if the companies made any significant renovations they were supposed to clean up their emissions Many companies did update their plants but did not clean up their emissions and beginning in the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency sued them The companies said the plant renovations werent significant and they didnt have to improve emissions Now the Bush administration is formally reviewing whether the lawsuits are justified Meanwhile the EPA is conducting its own review of the same policy and evaluating whether the whole law needs rewriting And Congress is in the act too This week Sen James M Jeffords IVt has scheduled two informal stakeholders meetings to broadly discuss air pollution by utilities At the center of much of the debate is the law firm Latham Watkins Two prominent officials of the Bush administration overseeing environmental issues came from Latham Watkins And it turns out Latham Watkins has been at the center of much of the lobbying effort on behalf of the very companies being sued for polluting the air The two former Latham partners involved are Phil Perry the soninlaw of Vice President Cheney and the acting associate attorney general overseeing the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department and Jeffrey Holmstead the new assistant administrator for air and radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency Both attorneys have said that they were not directly involved in representing the electricity companies Nevertheless Perry has recused himself and turned over the review to Viet Dinh the assistant attorney general for policy Dinh who came to the administration from Georgetown University law school has inherited the question of whether to continue pursuing these lawsuits a decision that will be closely scrutinized by all sides Unlike Perry Holmstead has not recused himself from his separate review To the contrary Holmstead is deep in the middle of the decisionmaking He is writing a legislative proposal that would ultimately replace the program The legislation is intended to be a multipronged way of addressing the various pollutants emitted by the electricitygenerating industry A primary part of the plan involves a pollutioncredits trading system Similar to a program implemented for acid rain the idea is that polluting plants could pay more to exceed minimum standards by purchasing credits from plants that fall below standards That idea is very similar to one being pushed by one of Holmsteads former colleagues at Latham Watkins Robert Sussman and some environmentalists think it is no coincidence Sussman is the lead lawyer and lobbyist for a group of electricityproducing companies called Energy for a Clean Air Future That group represents Cinergy Corp PPL Pennsylvania Power Light Corp Reliant Energy Inc Tampa Electric Co TransAlta Corp and Wisconsin Electric Power Co The environmentalists suspicions were also aroused because Holmstead was a protege of antiregulatory guru C Boyden Gray of Wilmer Cutler Pickering and Holmstead had been lauded for his work on the Council on Competitiveness a controversial regulationcutting commission in the Bush I administration Holmstead also was listed as the contact on lobbying documents for another powercompany trade group the Alliance for Constructive Air Policy which included companies such as Cinergy one of the companies he now regulates as the nations airpollution policy maker Part of his salary was coming from Cinergy said Frank ODonnell executive director of the environmental group Clean Air Trust Now he is promoting a viewpoint within the administration that is starkly similar to the viewpoint that these same Latham Watkins lawyers are advocating for their polluting clients Sussman who worked in the EPA during the Clinton administration poohpoohs the conspiracy theory First he points out that the pollution trading program has widespread support and that Holmsteads proposal looks a lot like Sen Jeffordss pollutiontrading proposal Second Holmstead did no lobbying work for the Alliance for Constructive Air Policy his role as contact was merely to make sure the lobbying reports were filed correctly I dont think Jeff has any preconceptions or axes to grind Sussman said I think he calls them as he sees them Washington is a small town but that doesnt mean that anything wrong is happening Holmstead for his part echoes what Sussman says He also points out that there is no connection between the Justice Department lawsuits and his current review of the policy He said he has carefully recused himself from any matter in which he was directly involved at Latham Also if he had to recuse himself from everything that the attorneys in his law firm handled out of their offices worldwide then he would have little to do Meanwhile the review of the EPA cases continues at the Justice Department More than companies are being sued throughout the country in one of the largest enforcement actions in EPA history Much is at stake there not the least of which is a lot of defense work for firms such as Troutman Sanders Balch Bingham featuring celebrity counsel former GOP chief Haley Barbour Porter Wright Morris Arthur Sidley Austin Hogan Hartson Hunton Williams Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld and Vinson Elkins Hey what are you guys in the Bush administration thinking You are
