nron cc Subject WEST DESKSFERC authorizes power marketers to purchase from industrials and more On March FERC issued an Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West Docket No EL Most significantly FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers like EPMI and EES effective through The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year we should hear from FERC on that request by midMay In addition FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates Specifics Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for backup for selfgeneration who will be public utilities subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to nonaffiliated entities like EPMI or EES without prior notice under section of FPA would usually require day advance notice filing Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial however the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases Our report must show the names of the industrial aggregate amount of capacity andor energy purchased from each seller and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller Accountingcommercial folks for EPMI and EES please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases only can sell what it generates unless otherwise allowed or not precluded by its retail tariff must file a rate schedule at FERC for this but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and authorizations This authorization expires after Effective through retail customers in WSCC as permitted by state laws and regulations and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at marketbased rates These transactions can occur in several ways An aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load under retail choice programs In addition wholesale and retail load with contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of power is greater than the value of consumption Similar quarterly reports would be due by EPMIEES NOTE the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with transmission provider may need new interconnection facilities etc Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is wheeled away from the industrial Other initiatives in the order Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are required to be filed at FERC Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of incremental and outofpocket costs for utilities Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current including CBM and TRM Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service by July and to a lesser extent by November of and Considers rolled in rates for generation interconnection rather than direct assignment that we have now Extends temporary waivers through of operating and efficiency standards for QFs Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates if sold in California and the WSCC FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching load ie if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection requests etc Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review Please let me know if you would like the order Ray Alvarez and I can assist you with this Thanks Embedded Picture Device

Union As usual my friends and I have been up to no good and fortunately for you I am ready and willing to tell you all a bout it There are so many people and things to talk about and only one Sta te of the Union to cover it all This could be a very rough ride so as al ways Brace Yourself Multiple choice question Which one of the these airport names does not be long A Reagan International Airport B Bush Intercontinental Airport C JFK Airport D Louis Armstrong National Airport Well in case you are stum ped here is a little hint think Satchmo Chris Coulon my political in sider told me that the city of New Orleans had narrowed it down to two cho ices Edwin Edwards National Airport or Louis Armstrong National Airport Well it was a close race but considering Edwin Edwards was convicted last y ear of numerous counts of bribery and extortion the City of New Orleans de cided on Louis Armstrong So now every time you fly into Satchmo make su re you highfive a friend as you pass that beautiful picture of Chris Owens and her year old breasts because you are now in New Orleans a place wh ere absolutely nothing gets taken serious Speaking of New Orleans has anyone read the book Confederacy of Dunces N ow that he lives in the French Quarter Granola Centola truly personifies t he books main character Ignatius Reilly Just last weekend while walkin g back to his apartment from Cats Meow Larry felt the need to relieve him self next to a neighbors carwhat a way to build neighborhood friendships While in midstream Larry got picked up by a policeman and dragged o ff to the Orleans Parish Prison OPP for indecent exposure and public drun kenness When I asked Larry what it was like to spend the night in the Bl ack Bar Hotel his response was It wasnt that bad I talked politics the whole night with my cellmates and he added the best thing was that the y cellmates were all Democrats Can you believe it Yes Larry we ca n believe that all your cellmates were Democrats Well if you havent already heard Shawn The Wop has moved back into Beau Chene College Apartments This move has made Shawn a target for jokes amon gst most of our friends Thankfully Shawn takes these comments with a gra in of salt and even recently commented to me that I Shawn love living in Beau Chene especially since I have been included in Jeff Jordans Landlo rds Monday Night Football parties Shawn says there is only two require ments to get into this party you must be a guy and you must BYOC Bring Your Own Cold Cuts Shawn says that no one seems to like his ham o r turkey and that for some reason there tends to be an enormous amount of S alami at these parties Shawn says it never fails whenever Jeff introduce s him as an old FIJI to someone at the party the first question is always Do you know Nick Nesbit and the Turner Twins and the second question is Do you like Salami Word to the wise Shawn you might want to rethink the meaning of the C part in BYOC While most of Houston wants the Summer Olympics in Houston so they can watch the events the girl I went on a date with a few weeks ago wants it to come here so she can compete in the Track and Field Events Now I am no t insecure about my manliness nor do I consider myself out of shape but a fter having dinner with the she hulk I felt pretty damn wimpy Thankfull y I had my good buddy Lenhart to pick me up from my deep depression We w ent out the following Thursday night to Houstons Latest Hot Spot TACO MIL AGRO Since Matt had a very bad case of Laryngitis we worked as a team I talked to all of the girls and Matt just stood there and smiled Oddly e nough we got a ton of girls phone numbers Matt couldnt understand it a nd even boasted about it the next day I Matt was on fire last night I didnt even say one word the whole night and for some reason I got more ph one numbers than ever before Overhearing our conversation Tim PawPaw Blanchard chimed in It is not a coincidence dude Speaking of PawPaw next Friday Night is Tims Bachelor Party in Baton Rou ge As most of you already know Tim does not have a spontaneous bone in h is body so he took the liberty of emailing us his itinerary See Below for next Friday nights Festivities PM Kiss Louise goodbye PM Drink beers with everyone at the Sheraton Hotel in Downto wn Baton Rouge PM Drink beers at the Gold Club and tell Landry how I Tim a m not like Lenhart I Tim dont like to get drunk and pick up chicks whil e hanging out at the Club Note In case you guys forgot Tim used to be a real partier Thats how he got the name PawPaw PM Watch Larry pass out at Freds while dancing to Blind Melon as he proceeds to get into fight with the bouncer AM Do one shot with friends and throw the other two shots on th e ground when no one else is looking Note Ive actually busted Tim usin g this tactic on several occasions AM Request Son of a Preacher Man at Freds and look for the cl osest PhiMu to slow dance with to the song AM Bailout a half drunk Granola Centola from Jail and when he w alks out say Larry what the fck AM Kiss Louise good night and dream about the Tigers kicking the hell out of Auburn Everyone have a Good Weekend GEAUX TIGERS CKL

red ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT and blah blah blah Shut up You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school University of Texas that would teach agriculture and mechanics Aggies love to say their school is older from where they get that I dont nowthe fact is the State intended AM to be a branch of UT They are like the afterbirth from the original creation Like Danny Devito in Twins So they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good All the while nobody at UT denies that AM is a good school yet they wont shut up So they write a fight songaboutTexas and how they want to beat them They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good AM and all its traditions are It is the worlds largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested in everything AM does The people at AM Now we all have friends who went to AM or are at AM There are some nice people there Howeverthere is the Corp East Texas answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys there is the Corp Now forget the fact that AM will actually let people with subpar grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them and swept under the rug over the years they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khakicladshavenheadeddorks I am sure each of you have your own stories The point is We all respect West Point Annapolis The Air Force Academy however nobody respects the Corp I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world Just because you dress like the Army and try and act like the Army does not make you the Army People at AM dont even respect these clowns It is not cool to shave your head and dress up Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians move to Israel It is even less cool to slobber on somebodys daughter on national television and call it a tradition Dry humping year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool Not only is it not cool it should be against the law I know that in College Station students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face But everywhere else in the world it is looked down upon Especially if you are doing it on my TV That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight coed during somebodys Thanksgiving dinner We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter Screw that forget makeup it is too late for that just give them a veil tu is not funny It is NOT insulting It is dumb Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about MA and giggling That would not be funny In fact it would be retarded Thats why UT fans dont do it Please learn You want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of sheep of people that arent stupid Then quit building things that fall downQuit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV Quit whooping in church Quit whooping period Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when youre running for Governor When you are filling out season ticket renewals and the form asks for your phone H W quit putting Height Weight Just collectively stop making asses of yourselves Go to East Texas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a th grade education why they cheer for AM and wear maroon That is your fan base This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid Nobody cares if you think your band is better They might be louder they might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability The point is nobody cares who wins halftime Quit getting geeked up about marching bands I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school bands entire halftime performance And why Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now Plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care Why is it cool all of a sudden now that youre in college Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe Oh waitI understand now Dogs are not ladies They dont look or smell like ladies Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly Finally College Station is an armpit of a town Quit pretending that it is a great college town It is a town and there is a college there That should be the end of this comparison If you feel that life doesnt get any better than the Dixie Chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending Dukes of Hazard episode then move there More importantly dont move to Austinthey are trying to create an educated technological and open minded population base Austin is and will continue to be the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool As my friend Stephen Johnson once said If the world were ever to get an enema College Station is where you would connect the hose If you go to school at AM please dont be an Aggie

Sent Friday October PM To Gillette Lisa Scott Susan M Subject The Never Marrieds redemption for the bridget joneses of us out here e In My Tribe October By ETHAN WATTERS It may be true that never marrieds are saving themselves for something better They may also be saving the institution of marriage while theyre at it You may be like me between the ages of and single a collegeeducated city dweller If so you may have also had the unpleasant experience of discovering that you have been identified by the US Census Bureau no less as one of the fastestgrowing groups in America the never marrieds In less than years the number of nevermarrieds has more than doubled apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the oldest it has been in our countrys history about years for women and for men As if the connotation of never married werent negative enough the vilification of our group has been swift and shrill These statistics prove a titanic loss of family values according to The Washington Times An article in Time magazine asked whether picky women were denying themselves and society the benefits of marriage and in the process kicking off an outbreak of Sex and the City promiscuity In a study on marriage conducted at Rutgers University researchers say the social glue of the family is at stake adding ominously that crime rates are highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males Although I never planned it I can tell you how I became a nevermarried Thirteen years ago I moved to San Francisco for what I assumed was a brief transition period between college and marriage The problem was I wasnt just looking for an appropriate spouse To use the language of the Rutgers researchers I was soulmate searching Like percent of nevermarrieds from to I too agree with the statement When you marry you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost This berromantic view is something new In a survey fully three out of four college women said theyd marry a man they didnt love if he fit their criteria in every other way I discovered along with my friends that finding that soul mate wasnt easy Girlfriends came and went as did jobs and apartments The constant in my life by default not by plan became a loose group of friends After a few years that groups membership and routines began to solidify We met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood restaurant We traveled together moved one anothers furniture painted one anothers apartments cheered one another on at sporting events and openmike nights One day I discovered that the transition period I thought I was living wasnt a transition period at all Something real and important had grown there I belonged to an urban tribe I use the word tribe quite literally here this is a tight group with unspoken roles and hierarchies whose members think of each other as us and the rest of the world as them This bond is clearest in times of trouble After earthquakes or the recent terrorist strikes my instinct to huddle with and protect my group is no different from what Id feel for my family Once I identified this in my own life I began to see tribes everywhere I looked a house of exsorority women in Philadelphia a team of ultimatefrisbee players in Boston and groups of musicians in Austin Tex Cities Ive come to believe arent emotional wastelands where fragile individuals with arrested development mope around selfindulgently searching for true love There are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes So what does it mean that weve quietly added the tribe years as a developmental stage to adulthood Because our friends in the tribe hold us responsible for our actions I doubt it will mean a wild swing toward promiscuity or crime Tribal behavior does not prove a loss of family values It is a fresh expression of them It is true though that marriage and the tribe are at odds As many exgirlfriends will ruefully tell you loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc on romantic relationships Not surprisingly marriage usually signals the beginning of the end of tribal membership From inside the group marriage can seem like a risky gambit When members of our tribe choose to get married the rest of us talk about them with grave concern as if theyve joined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound But we also know that the urban tribe cant exist forever Those of us who have entered our mids find ourselves feeling vaguely as if were living in the latter episodes of Seinfeld or Friends as if the plot lines of our lives have begun to wear thin So although tribe membership may delay marriage that is where most of us are still heading And it turns out there may be some good news when we get there Divorce rates have leveled off Tim Heaton a sociologist at Brigham Young University says he believes he knows why In a paper to be published next year he argues that it is because people are getting married later Could it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now actually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate What a fantastic twist we never marrieds may end up revitalizing the very institution weve supposedly been undermining And theres another dynamic worth considering Those of us who find it so hard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely as if it is the inevitable next step in our lives the way middleclass highschool kids choose college When we go to the altar we will be sacrificing something precious In that sacrifice we may begin to learn to treat our marriages with the reverence they need to survive Ethan Watters is a writer living in San Francisco Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp

MNArchitectscom To Susan Scott Subject RE Whistler Date Tue Jan i do hope you can come with us how fun that you have been down in utah sounds great of course you could stay with me on the friday night that would be perfect must tell you though that there is a bit of change in plans sam and ali in order to make the trip somewhat cheaper have also invited a couple of guys that they know to stay with us as well im fine with it because i say the more the merrier but it could be kind of crowded of course the guys will be on the floor with their sleeping bags and the girls will have the beds but still i guess this would have to be something you are comfortable with i really dont think wed have to even hang out with the guys much we could and i plan on totally doing my own thing ali and sam are both really cool they are partiers and very fun but also sweet and very smart ali graduated from washington state with a degree in art studies i think and studied abroad in denmark for a year sam is a school teacher english junior high aged kids and went to college somewhere in california where they are both from they are cool and i think you would get along great with them and they with you of course it would be great if you could coincide your trip with another one to have a few interviews up here hope you can find a cheap flight and let me know how the job search is going take care bonnie ps i did hear about the suicide of one of the top execs so incredibly sad what a messy business i saw ken lays wife interviewed she maintains her husband is ENTIRELY innocent and had nothing to do with the fall etc what do you make of that it was very interesting oh my date with the memphis guy was good very interesting he was really cute and we kissed at the end of the night it was fun he was funny would definitely go out with him again if he asked but we are also pretty different people for instance he never drinks Original Message From Susan Scott mailto Sent Saturday January PM To

right now visiting my friend monique and for some reason this computer wont let me send things from my other address anyway i flew in today and will be here through tuesday at least its absolutely beautiful right now im hanging at the internet cafe until monique gets off work and then were going to grab some food and maybe go out for a bitsupposedly its Australia Day here i think its an informal holiday so you know tonight will be fun w all the aussies around here painting the town red the whistler trip sounds awesome i will definitely do some research and see what kind of fares i can find to get myself up there a huge part of me is still feeling this intense draw to move to the emerald city hopefully something will pan out that allows that to happen we shall see this last week at work was so tryingjust making the decisions i had to etc but everyone there has been really cool about it and has offered to help in any way they can most of the older married people are encouraging me to just enjoy myself and have an adventure im not sure if you heard the latest news from enron but one of our former execs he resignedretired in May committed suicide its very sad and just reconfirms to me that this chapter of my life needs to be closed and that i need to head on to bigger and better things its been entirely too taxing to deal w all the emotions than accompany this type of thingand somehow still being a part of the reformed trading organization would only seem to keep those wounds open for me ok enough morbid stuff hope all is well with you if i remember correctly you are supposed to be on your date tonight with the west point guy cant wait to here how that went i will get back to you ASAP about whistleras soon as ive had a chance to look at airfares and my options do you think itd be possible to stay with you friday night if i did end up coming that way we could head out bright and early saturday morning fortunately im going to get some skiing in
