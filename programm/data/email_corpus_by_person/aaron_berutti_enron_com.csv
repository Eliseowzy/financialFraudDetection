<7422520.1075852809797.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,aaron.berutti@enron.com,2001-10-08 10:06:17,concernMr Lay I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge so I had to get a guest pass this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time However I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license which hasnt been a problem for most terrorists to acquire of somebody who works here at Enron Can you see where I am going with this Anyway Im a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody Sincerely Aaron Berutti ENA Gas Fundamentals
