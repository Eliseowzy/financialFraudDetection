CIRCUIT TASK FORCE URGES ONLY LIMITED USE OF AUCTIONS TO PICK CLASS COUNSEL JUDGES CRITICAL OF REPORTS NEGATIVITY Judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel in class actions should be used only in certain limited circumstances according to a draft report issued by the Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class Counsel An auction might be appropriate for a case in which the defendants liability appears clear damages appear to be both very large and collectible and the lead plaintiff is not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained counsel of its choice through a reasonable armslength process the task force suggests Several judges criticize the report as being too hostile toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for selecting class counsel The judges participating in a panel discussion at the Third Circuit Judicial Conference say the report is too restrictive For instance the task force should encourage more experimentation with the process of setting fees at the outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end one judge suggests But others who agree with the tenor of the report say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping counsel

exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of civil rights The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of also would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys fees under contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims A companion bill is pending in the House The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act which made damage awards that are not based on physical injury or physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff Because most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical injuries this provision has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights Collins explains Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagcd NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHTLINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS OBSERVERS The National Labor Relations Board adopts a brightline rule prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using their nonemployee agents as election observers for decertification elections The board overturns a decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of misconduct by the union agent citing neutrality of the election process as the reason for its brightline rule The board distinguishes decertification elections from initial representation elections in which nonemployee union observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage in misconduct and the agents presence does not interfere with any partys rights In our view it is more likely that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a person who is an agent of a union that is his bargaining representative than by a person who is an agent of a union that wishes to become the bargaining representative

discrimination suits are not subject to the Civil Rights Acts caps on compensatory damages the US Supreme Court rules The unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the majority view on the issue Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement The front pay remedy has long been available under Section g of the Civil Rights Act Because the Act authorized compensatory and punitive damages in addition to remedies already available under Section g the court concludes that the caps do not apply to front pay awards Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagag INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES Maines novel prescription drug price control statute is not preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the commerce clause the First Circuit rules The Maine program makes prescription drugs available at a discount to uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with the state Rejecting a conflict preemption claim the court says the rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are consonant with the Medicaid program by making prescription drugs more accessible to lowincome people Finding no merit to the commerce clause challenge the court says that the Maine statute does not apply extraterritorially or discriminate against outofstate manufacturers and that its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate commerce Page ipBNAlawnsfidaafna JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLEENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED RETURN The

methodology urged by the government the US Supreme Court decides The ruling resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product liability loss carryback under Section of the Internal Revenue Code In the governments view affiliates that generate positive separate taxable income should not contribute to product liability loss eligible for the carryback But the court finds the taxpayers singleentity approach a preferable reading of the tax code and applicable regulations rejecting the governments claim that it will lead to tax avoidance abuses Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagym IN THIS ISSUE A

legislation to exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of civil rights The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of also would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys fees under contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims A companion bill is pending in the House The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act which made damage awards that are not based on physical injury or physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff Because most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical injuries this provision has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights Collins explains Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagcd NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHTLINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS OBSERVERS The National Labor Relations Board adopts a brightline rule prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using their nonemployee agents as election observers for decertification elections The board overturns a decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of misconduct by the union agent citing neutrality of the election process as the reason for its brightline rule The board distinguishes decertification elections from initial representation elections in which nonemployee union observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage in misconduct and the agents presence does not interfere with any partys rights In our view it is more likely that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a person who is an agent of a union that is his bargaining representative than by a person who is an agent of a union that wishes to become the bargaining representative

employment discrimination suits are not subject to the Civil Rights Acts caps on compensatory damages the US Supreme Court rules The unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the majority view on the issue Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement The front pay remedy has long been available under Section g of the Civil Rights Act Because the Act authorized compensatory and punitive damages in addition to remedies already available under Section g the court concludes that the caps do not apply to front pay awards Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagag INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES Maines novel prescription drug price control statute is not preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the commerce clause the First Circuit rules The Maine program makes prescription drugs available at a discount to uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with the state Rejecting a conflict preemption claim the court says the rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are consonant with the Medicaid program by making prescription drugs more accessible

its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate commerce Page ipBNAlawnsfidaafna JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLEENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED

methodology urged by the government the US Supreme Court decides The ruling resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product liability loss carryback under Section of the Internal Revenue Code In the governments view affiliates that generate positive separate taxable income should not contribute to product liability loss eligible for the carryback But the court finds the taxpayers singleentity approach a preferable reading of the tax code and applicable regulations rejecting the governments claim that it will lead to tax avoidance abuses Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagym IN THIS ISSUE A

CIRCUIT TASK FORCE URGES ONLY LIMITED USE OF AUCTIONS TO PICK CLASS COUNSEL JUDGES CRITICAL OF REPORTS NEGATIVITY Judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel in class actions should be used only in certain limited circumstances according to a draft report issued by the Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class Counsel An auction might be appropriate for a case in which the defendants liability appears clear damages appear to be both very large and collectible and the lead plaintiff is not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained counsel of its choice through a reasonable armslength process the task force suggests Several judges criticize the report as being too hostile toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for selecting class counsel The judges participating in a panel discussion at the Third Circuit Judicial Conference say the report is too restrictive For instance the task force should encourage more experimentation with the process of setting fees at the outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end one judge suggests But others who agree with the tenor of the report say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping counsel fees reasonable Page s Page ipBNAlawnsfidaayvf ipBNAlawnsfidaayhx NEW YORK BAR PROPOSES AMENDING ABA MODEL RULES TO ALLOW CAREFULLY REGULATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ALLIANCES The New York State Bar Association files a proposal with the American Bar Association recommending amendment of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct to allow limited and carefully regulated contractual relationships and other affiliations between lawyers and nonlawyers who want to offer their clients integrated multidisciplinary services Foremost among the safeguards being advocated by the New York bar are measures that would prohibit nonlawyers from holding any ownership or managerial interest in law firms sharing legal fees with lawyers directing or regulating the professional judgment of lawyers or compromising in any other way a lawyers duty to safeguard client interests The proposal is patterned on recent amendments to the New York Code of Professional Responsibility allowing such affiliations

Courts recent Zadvydas decision which held that absent special circumstances the attorney general lacks authority to detain such aliens indefinitely The rule specifies procedures for aliens who have been detained beyond the statutory day removal period to demonstrate that their removal is unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future Aliens seeking relief must make a threshold showing that they have cooperated with the INSs efforts to effect their removal Aliens who prevail on such claims must be released subject to conditions of supervision unless special circumstances would render release

least years of incarceration for a nonviolent recidivist convicted of petty theft violate the Eighth Amendment the Ninth Circuit declares The court finds the sentence grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the defendants property crimes and to comparable sentences in other jurisdictions The Three Strikes law imposes a minimum year sentence without parole for any third felony offense by a

property right the court reasons The court distinguishes fraud on the court from inequitable conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office in obtaining the patent which taints the patent itself and

legislation to exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of civil rights The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of also would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys fees under contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims A companion bill is pending in the House The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act which made damage awards that are not based on physical injury or physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff Because most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical injuries this provision has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights Collins explains Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagcd NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHTLINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS OBSERVERS The National Labor Relations Board adopts a brightline rule prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using their nonemployee agents as election observers for decertification elections The board overturns a decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of misconduct by the union agent citing neutrality of the election process as the reason for its brightline rule The board distinguishes decertification elections from initial representation elections in which nonemployee union observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage in misconduct and the agents presence does not interfere with any partys rights In our view it is more likely that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a person who is an agent of a union that is his bargaining representative than by a person who is an agent of a union that wishes to become the bargaining representative

employment discrimination suits are not subject to the Civil Rights Acts caps on compensatory damages the US Supreme Court rules The unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the majority view on the issue Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement The front pay remedy has long been available under Section g of the Civil Rights Act Because the Act authorized compensatory and punitive damages in addition to remedies already available under Section g the court concludes that the caps do not apply to front pay awards Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagag INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES Maines novel prescription drug price control statute is not preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the commerce clause the First Circuit rules The Maine program makes prescription drugs available at a discount to uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with the state Rejecting a conflict preemption claim the court says the rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are consonant with the Medicaid program by making prescription drugs more accessible to lowincome people Finding no merit to the commerce clause challenge the court says that the Maine statute does not apply extraterritorially or discriminate against outofstate manufacturers and that its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate commerce Page ipBNAlawnsfidaafna JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLEENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED RETURN The product liability loss for an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return should be determined using the singleentity approach urged by the taxpayer not the separatemember methodology urged by the government the US Supreme Court decides The ruling resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product liability loss carryback under Section of the Internal Revenue Code In the governments view affiliates that generate positive separate taxable income should not contribute to product liability loss eligible for the carryback But the court finds the taxpayers singleentity approach a preferable reading of the tax code and applicable regulations rejecting the governments claim that it will lead to tax avoidance abuses Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagym IN THIS ISSUE A

employment discrimination suits are not subject to the Civil Rights Acts caps on compensatory damages the US Supreme Court rules The unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the majority view on the issue Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement The front pay remedy has long been available under Section g of the Civil Rights Act Because the Act authorized compensatory and punitive damages in addition to remedies already available under Section g the court concludes that the caps do not apply to front pay awards Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagag INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES Maines novel prescription drug price control statute is not preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the commerce clause the First Circuit rules The Maine program makes prescription drugs available at a discount to uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with the state Rejecting a conflict preemption claim the court says the rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are consonant with the Medicaid program by making prescription drugs more accessible to lowincome people Finding no merit to the commerce clause challenge the court says that the Maine statute does not apply extraterritorially or discriminate against outofstate manufacturers and that its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate commerce Page ipBNAlawnsfidaafna JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLEENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED RETURN The product liability loss for an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return should be determined using the singleentity approach urged by the taxpayer not the separatemember methodology urged by the government the US Supreme Court decides The ruling resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product liability loss carryback under Section of the Internal Revenue Code In the governments view affiliates that generate positive separate taxable income should not contribute to product liability loss eligible for the carryback But the court finds the taxpayers singleentity approach a preferable reading of the tax code and applicable regulations rejecting the governments claim that it will lead to tax avoidance abuses Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagym IN THIS ISSUE A

legislation to exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of civil rights The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of also would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys fees under contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims A companion bill is pending in the House The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act which made damage awards that are not based on physical injury or physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff Because most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical injuries this provision has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights Collins explains Page ipBNAlawnsfidaagcd NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHTLINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS OBSERVERS The National Labor Relations Board adopts a brightline rule prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using their nonemployee agents as election observers for decertification elections The board overturns a decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of misconduct by the union agent citing neutrality of the election process as the reason for its brightline rule The board distinguishes decertification elections from initial representation elections in which nonemployee union observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage in misconduct and the agents presence does not interfere with any partys rights In our view it is more likely that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a person who is an agent of a union that is his bargaining representative than by a person who is an agent of a union that wishes to become the bargaining representative

Microsoftare pulling the Federal Communications Commission in different directions as the agency reviews AOLs planned merger with Time Warner Microsoft urges the FCC not to clear the deal without imposing instantmessaging interoperability conditions on AOL Page ipBNActlnsfidaaudq CLAIM THAT AOL CODE WRONGLY DENIED ACCESS TO COMPETITORS ADVANCES The class action litigation against America Online Inc and its version software alleging a common law product liability claim and a violation of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act moves forward with a trial date set for and an amended complaint recently filed In essence the suits claim that the AOL software makes it impossible to get access to another ISP once the software is installed with AOL chosen as the default ISP Also the plaintiffs claim AOL knew from its beta testers that these and other problems existed but that the online giant refused to fix the software before releasing it Page ipBNActlnsfidaauff LICENSE AMBIGUOUS ON REMOTE SERVICE AND STANDALONE PRODUCTS A software license that did not specifically enumerate permitted uses and contemplated purposes was ambiguous a federal district court in Michigan rules Under the license agreement the licensee could sublicense the software only as a component of its products The dispute comes after the licensee announced plans to offer services from the companys premises remotely via Internet Page ipBNActlnsfidaavhu CIVIL SERVANTS EMAIL MESSAGES EXEMPT FROM RELEASE AS PUBLIC RECORD The contents of email messages sent and received by a county employee were public records under Washington state law but were nevertheless exempt from disclosure as personal information a Washington appeals court rules The court says that the number of personal messages sent by the employee who was being paid to perform government administrative duties was a matter of public concern but the contents of the messages were personal in nature and outside the realm of interests promoted by the state open records law Page ipBNActlnsfidaaveq Lead Report YEAR Xerox Corps considerable threeyear delay in giving notice to its insurance carrier of potential liability for YK remediation expenses prejudiced the carrier and warrants dismissal of the action a New York trial court rules The ruling appears to be the first to address the notice issue which is expected to affect several other similar pending cases including those brought by Kmart Corp and Nike Inc Page ipBNActlnsfidaavzr ALSO IN THE NEWS ANTITRUST An action against Microsoft Corp alleging injury from unlawful monopolization of the licensing market for Intelcompatible computers is stayed by a New York trial court pending a decision by the plaintiff on opting out of a similar federal action The court also dismisses state law class action claims Page ipBNActlnsfidaaubc ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE The final report issued by an independent review team for Carnivore the FBIs Internet surveillance tool reiterates an earlier conclusion that the system does not provide adequate protection from the risk of unauthorized FBI interception of private electronic communications The report is largely unchanged from a previous draft Page ipBNActlnsfidaauxc TRADE SECRETS Alleged trade secrets concerning penbased computer technologies acquired by Microsoft Corp after they had been placed in a patent application were not sufficiently secret to support an action for trade secret misappropriation by the software giant a federal district court in California rules Page ipBNActlnsfidaavcq TEXT YEAR Text of American Guarantee Liab Ins Co v Xerox Corp NY Sup Ct New York Cty Page ipBNActlnsfidaavcr TABLE OF CONTENTS LEAD REPORT YEAR Threeyear delay in giving notice to insurer doomed claim for YK

the initial vote overslept and then unilaterally scheduled a second election according to the Eighth Circuit NLRB v Superior of Missouri Inc th Cir No Considering the circumstances surrounding the hotly contested election the board officers unilateral action might have had an impact on the second vote and warranted an NLRB hearing on Superior of Missouris objections to the election the divided appeals court panel holds A dissenting judge finds that the objections raised by the employer were insufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing He rejects the employers argument that the board

FINAL HELPERS RULE The Department of Labor releases a final rule to amend DavisBacon Act regulations to allow contractors on federal and federally assisted construction projects to use helpers when that practice prevails in an area The final rule is scheduled for publication in the Nov Federal Register The final rule states that a distinct classification of helper will be issued in wage determinations applicable to work performed on construction projects covered by the labor standards provisions of the DavisBacon and Related Acts The agency says however that the classification will apply only where i the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as a trainee in an informal training program A union attorney expresses doubt the rule will succeed in setting any helper determination while a representative of the Associated Builders and Contractors says the organization is considering litigation against the rule which he says ignores the realities of the workplace and refuses to recognize

delay in obtaining a desired transfer in the absence of some other negative or unfavorable effect from the delay constitutes an adverse action Judge Anderson writes for the court The only consequence of the transfer delay the court finds was that Amro was forced to face unpleasant and vulgar encounters with his supervisor The supervisors conduct however was not itself sufficiently negative and

Albertsons Inc committed unfair labor practices in violation of the National Labor Relations Act by barring two unions members from distributing handbills outside grocery stores in Oregon and

continues to grow causing increases in the costs of pensions Social Security and health benefits However worker productivity is likely to keep pace with those costs according to Gary Burtless a senior

Atlas Air the appeals court acknowledges that employers covered by the act may change working conditions when no bargaining contract exists between the parties However Judge Sentelle decides where the challenged modification to the status quo is far from merely formal and is in fact the equivalent of a substantial decrease in compensation having a real and material impact on the conditions of employment and is justified on no other grounds than union certification we may presume that the carriers actions were motivated by antiunion animus and are in violation of RLA Section Third and

ON FORUM FOR INJURED DECKHANDS CLAIMS The US Supreme Court hears oral argument in a case involving an injured deckhand who wants to pursue a state court personal injury suit under the Jones Act and a shipowner who wants instead to proceed with a Limitation of Liability Act suit in federal court Lewis v Lewis Clark Marine Inc US No James Lewis claims he injured his back while working aboard a tugboat owned by Lewis Clark Marine Inc on the Mississippi River The company sued in federal court in Missouri under the Limitation Act which allows shipowners to limit their liability to the value of the shipowners interest in the vessel and its freight if the damage or injury occurred without the shipowners knowledge Lewis then sued in an Illinois state court bringing Jones Act and other claims Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Limitation Act suits which do not allow jury trials but the savings to suitors clause allows claimants to keep access to all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled under other statutes or common law The Eighth Circuit blocked Lewiss state court suit finding the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction His attorney argues to the Supreme Court that the state suit should proceed and only if the judgment exceeds the value of the vessel and its freight should the company be able to go to federal court to limit the judgment Page

election win by the International Union of Operating Engineers the National Labor Relations Board rules in a decision Nortech Waste NLRB No released Members Truesdale and Walsh agree with an administrative law judge that Nortech Waste committed unfair labor practices by contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service a few days after the election and telling employees they could not work until they straightened out their paperwork The company significantly departed from its ordinary course of business belying its contention that it was merely trying to comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act the board finds Dissenting Chairman Hurtgen maintains Nortech did not fire the workers on Oct The company informed the employees that it had contacted INS that the workers had

NEW ELECTION Freund Baking Cos maintenance of a personnel handbook provision illegally barring employees from discussing wages hours and other terms and conditions of employment requires setting aside a representation election National Labor Relations Board rules Freund Baking Co NLRB No released Ordering that a third election be held in the longrunning case Members Truesdale and Walsh agree with a hearing officer that employees could reasonably interpret the confidentiality provision as prohibiting them from discussing their wages and working conditions with a union as well as with others

APPEALS COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE NOHIRE AGREEMENT A Wisconsin supplier of physical therapists cannot enforce a nohire agreement with a group of nursing homes which was entered into without the therapists knowledge or consent the Wisconsin Court of Appeals decides addressing an issue of first impression Heyde Cos dba Greenbriar Rehabilitation v Dove Healthcare LLC Wis Ct App No Under

therapists without the suppliers consent If Greenbriar consented the nursing home had to pay the supplier a steep fee Dove hired Greenbriar therapists without seeking the suppliers consent or paying the fee Overturning a judgment for Greenbriar the appeals court decides the nohire provision is unenforceable because it violates Wisconsin public policy favoring unrestrained competition in the

contract Judge Peterson says Page AA ipBNAdlrnsfidaawft NINTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS MILLION DAMAGES AWARD IN RACE BIAS CASE A companys failure to respond to coworkers harassment of its only African American

Cir No In the latest development in a longstanding labor dispute the Fourth Circuit agrees to enforce an NLRB bargaining order based on the boards showing that Pepsi violated the National Labor Relations Act by unilaterally changing various employment policies following the election The court rejects Pepsis contention that the United Food and Commercial Workers waived its right to bargain over the unilateral policy changes which included new compensation procedures altered work schedules and stricter disciplinary procedures Given a UFCW representatives testimony that she received notice of the proposed changes after they were announced to employees the court concludes the union did not waive its right to bargain over the changes by failing to request bargaining It also finds

common law mailbox rule to a participants claim that she had mailed her lumpsum distribution election form the Ninth Circuit rules in a decision Schikore v BankAmerica Supplemental Retirement Plan th Cir No The function of the mailbox rule in the context of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act is to provide employees with a guarantee that if the retirement plan claims not to have received a document that an employee mailed the document will nevertheless be presumed to have been received by the plan unless the plan can produce probative evidence of nonreceipt the majority says In denying the participants request for a lumpsum distribution the plan administrator found that the common law mailbox rule which creates a rebuttable presumption of receipt upon proof of proper mailing was inapplicable in the context of ERISA The dissent contends that the plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in declining to follow the mailbox rule because the plan explicitly states that the

POSTAL FIRING JUSTICES SAY In reviewing the reasonableness of a US Postal Service workers termination for cumulative misconduct the Merit Systems Protection Board may consider past discipline of the

employee may be faced with a board decision that reaches a different result than the grievance arbitrator ultimately might reach or never have his or her grievance resolved because a collective bargaining agreement requires union withdrawal of a grievance when the board issues a final decision There is nothing unfair in those results however the court says because a unionrepresented federal employee who elects to pursue a board appeal does in fact receive an independent review of the reasonableness of the agencys discipline Nevertheless the court remands the case involving Postal Service

contract effective immediately and running until September The vote ends a sevenweek strike by some employees represented by the Machinists at the refrigerator and microwave oven manufacturing plant The new contract addresses three issues that prompted the strike mandatory overtime a twotiered wage system and health insurance premium increases Ed Miller business representative for IAM Local says although union members are not entirely satisfied with the changes they approved the contract in the belief it was the best that could be achieved this year The union recommended approval of the pact According to Miller the contract calls for an hourly pay increase of over term with a cent raise this year cents next year and cents in late Average pay at the plant is currently per hour New hires will receive percent of the previous minimum pay and will not reach the top of the pay scale as quickly as under the previous contract Maytag proposed increasing mandatory overtime to hours per week per worker but the union was able to keep it to eight hours per week per employee Miller says Union negotiators were less successful in addressing their concerns with health insurance and the new

comments to the Labor Department they insist that the current regulations interpreting the companionship services exemption are legally valid and reflect the intent of Congress when it amended the

Co NLRB No released Reversing an NLRB administrative law judge Chairman Hurtgen and Member Liebman rule that ES Sutton Realty Co unlawfully refused to hire five workers after it ended its contract

rules Foster v Mahdesian th Cir No Reversing summary judgment granted to four nonmember teachers the appeals court holds action more serious than the routine collection of fees is required to trigger a public employers duty to ensure that its employees receive adequate financial disclosure The appeals court applies its decision in Knight v Kenai Peninsula Borough School District which held that a

policy does not violate the fundamental right of marriage and advances a legitimate governmental interest Judge Boggs writes for the appeals court in rejecting Jennifer and Keith Vaughns argument that

under the group life insurance plan the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois rules finding the employee was not eligible for coverage when he enrolled Ostler v OceUSA Inc ND Ill No C Judge Kocoras finds that recovery of life insurance benefits that would have been paid if Tim Ostler had been eligible for coverage under the plan would not be appropriate equitable relief under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act The court rejects the Second Circuits reasoning in a similar decision in Strom v Goldman Sachs Co Judge Kocoras says he disagrees with the Second Circuits conclusion that Title VII remedies can be imported into an ERISA context because the rationales underlying the two statutes are simply too different While Ostler was on shortterm disability leave OceUSA offered a new group life insurance plan Ostler elected to participate in the plan and OceUSA began deducting plan premiums from his paycheck After Ostlers death his widows benefit claim was

Webner v Titan Distrib Inc th Cir No Affirming for the most part a judgment for plaintiff Randall Webner the appeals court rejects the argument by Titan Distribution Inc that Webner does not have a

and to stand in addition to limiting his ability to lift Judge Hansen writes for the appeals court The court however vacates a punitive damages award Observing that a plaintiff seeking such damages

more leeway in providing investment advice to employees participating in selfdirected retirement savings plans are debated in a hearing before the House Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on EmployerEmployee Relations The risks inherent in enacting legislation HR that would allow employers to give employees access to investment advice are outweighed by the need for increased access and offset by safeguards to protect employees says John Boehner ROhio chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee and sponsor of the Retirement Security Advice Act Ann Combs assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare benefits calls providing increased access to investment advice a critical issue and says the Labor Department supports the proposed amendments to ERISA

appeals court rules that Antonio Sanchezs sexual harassment claims under Title VII and the Washington Law Against Discrimination should survive because he was singled out for harassment by male coworkers and a supervisor who considered him feminine and believed he did not meet their views of a male stereotype Judges Gould and Reinhardt find that while Azteca did have a sexual harassment policy in place and exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment its response to Sanchezs complaints was not sufficiently prompt to avoid liability Dissenting on the issue of vicarious

with placards calling on the Labor Department to issue a standard to protect workers and criticizing the scheduling of hearings The issue isnt about whether we should deal with ergonomics injuries its about how we deal with them Chao says Pat Cleary of the National Association of Manufacturers says the best ergonomics approach is one based on more scientific research more emphasis on best practices and more clarity regarding what is and is not workrelated He urges the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a clearinghouse of best practices Eric Frumin health and safety director

procedures the amount of time spent bargaining and the number of bargaining sessions the amount of progress made in negotiations and how near the parties are to agreement and the presence or absence

union the District of Columbia Circuit rules Willamette Indus Inc v NLRB DC Cir No Judge Ginsburg decides the board misapplied the goodfaith doubt standard The board held that Willamette by waiving its right to appeal a hearing officers determination that the decertification election should have been set aside because of the companys objectionable conduct left the election result tainted and therefore had no basis for a goodfaith doubt Even if Willamettes waiver can be construed as an acknowledgment that the results of the tally stood tainteda matter cast in some doubt by the

the Bush administration on the scope of the direct threat defense available to employers under the Americans with Disabilities Act Chevron USA Inc v Echazabal US No interim order Chevron USA Inc is seeking Supreme Court review of the Ninth Circuits decision last October that employers cannot exclude workers who do not pose a threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace but may pose a threat to their own health or safety The threejudge panel initially issued a unanimous decision in May but Judge Trott later switched sides and the court issued an amended decision adding his dissent The appeals court reversed the summary judgment granted to Chevron by a federal district court and allowed Mario Echazabal an oil refinery worker with hepatitis C to proceed with his ADA suit The appeals court majority rejected an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission interpretive regulation stating that employers may assert a direct threat defense regarding employees who pose a threat

employees while distributing union literature without making any express or implied threats was not objectionable conduct The board overruled its decision in PepsiCola Bottling Co of Los Angeles which held that a union representative photographing employees without giving an explanation or justification while the employees engage in protected activity violates the National Labor Relations Act But the board declined to overrule its ruling in Mike Yurosek Son Inc which ordered a new election because a union representative threatened an antiunion employee in connection with photographing

decision that an affirmative bargaining order was necessary because a mobile food catering business made sham sales of catering trucks and routes to avoid unionization the District of Columbia Circuit rules Douglas Foods Corp v NLRB DC Cir No While antiunion animus may well have motivated the decision by Douglas Foods Corp to sell the trucks and routes there is not substantial evidence to support

recent ruling rejecting the National Labor Relations Boards latest test for determining whether nurses are supervisors and therefore unable to join a union many unions representing health care professionals say they will continue with organizing efforts among nurses despite the adverse ruling In May the justices ruled in NLRB v Kentucky River Community Care Inc that the boards test for deciding whether a worker exercises independent judgment in performing certain job tasksand therefore qualifies as a supervisorwas inconsistent with the National Labor Relations Act In so ruling the court affirmed by a vote a federal appeals courts refusal to enforce the boards decision that six registered nurses at a health care facility run by the Kentucky River Community Care Inc were not supervisors because they did not exercise independent judgment in performing their duties Some health care employer advocates and labor lawyers agree that bringing the issue back before the board could be a daunting task Not only is this the second time the Supreme Court has shot down NLRBs attempt to characterize certain nurses as nonsupervisors but the changing political climate may signal a board less inclined to tackle this issue again they said Nonetheless while advocates for employers and employees debate the significance and possible ramifications of the decisions most health care

Reversing a decision by a threemember panel of the court Judge Evans observes that the amount owed to the employees of Fort Wayne Indbased Bentz Metal Products Co Inc an amount governed by the companys collective bargaining agreement with United Auto Workers Local was not in dispute Therefore the claim did not require an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and was not preempted by the act he finds Judge Bauer dissents accusing the majority of sidestepping the law to reach an equitable result Even though the amount due to the Bentz workers was not in dispute Bauer

health benefit plan Erickson v Bartell Drug Co WD Wash No CL Although the plan covers almost all drugs and devices used by men the exclusion of prescription contraceptives creates a gaping hole in the coverage offered to female employees leaving a fundamental and immediate healthcare need uncovered Judge Lasnik writes in granting summary judgment to a class of female employees Title VII requires

BNA Customer Relations at Mon Fri am pm ET HIGHLIGHTS PANEL WITNESSES DEBATE BILL TO ALTER WAY BONUS PAY AFFECTS OVERTIME RATES At a House subcommittee hearing lawmakers and witnesses hold fast to opposing positions on a bill HR that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to give employers more leeway in the way they calculate overtime pay rates for nonexempt employees who have received performance bonuses Rep Biggert RIll vice chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committees Subcommittee on Workforce Protections says the bill would eliminate disincentives in current law that deter employers from offering performancebased bonuses and make it easier for employers to share the wealth with their employees Michael Leibig an attorney testifying on behalf of the AFLCIO says the bill would give employers the authority to legally designate as bonus pay any portion of an employees compensation beyond the minimum wage While critics contend that only unscrupulous employers would attempt such a move Leibig adds we should assume that all employers who are scrupulous will answer to their stockholders Its something that any employer would take advantage of Rutgers University professor Charles Fay disagrees with Leibig that employers could get away with a scheme to use language in the bill to reduce employees base wages Given the language of the bill it would be impossible he said The bill includes language that requires employers to put any incentivebased compensation plan in writing and make it available to employees he says and it requires those bonus payments to be based on a formula that is stated in the plan and maintained in good faith Page AA ipBNAdlrnsfidaanba NLRB RULES CASINO ILLEGALLY BARRED HANDBILLING BY RESTAURANT WORKERS The owner of

portecochere area just outside the entrance to the casino because it is a nonwork area In the second decision the board finds the hotelcasino committed an unfair labor practice by stopping offduty Ark

While agreeing that the painters wages constituted commissions the court remands the case for a determination of whether his regular rate of pay was high enough for the FLSA exemption to apply Calling the majoritys definition of commissions expansive the dissent says there is considerable doubt as to whether Congress intended to shield payment plans such as the one at issue in this case from the FLSAs requirements It argues that the painter was not paid on a commission basis simply because his compensation was linked to the amount of time allotted to the job in an automobile repair estimate By any ordinary understanding of the meaning of commissions the payments to the painter are not commissions the dissenting judge says The painter does not generate sales or jobs for his employer but rather is an ordinary wageearning employee performing service work in an automobile garage Page A ipBNAdlrnsfidaapcv PARTICIPANT HAS STANDING TO CHALLENGE PENSION PLAN AMENDMENT A participant in a

to sue Allsteel Inc for modifying the pension plan the Seventh Circuit finds that Johnson experienced an injuryinfact even though the plan administrator had not yet adversely exercised its discretion against him The plan amendment adversely impacted Johnson because it decreased his rights under the plan the court said By adding language that granted itself discretionary authority to determine eligibility under and to construe the Plan Allsteel increased the likelihood that Johnson will at some point be denied benefits under the Plan This correspondingly decreased the certainty of his Plan

CURRENT NLRB MEMBERS DISCUSS MAJOR RULINGS JUDICIAL CRITICISM The four current members of the National Labor Relations Board discuss their views on past and future issues before the board criticism by the appeals courts and the board during the Clinton era during a session at the American Bar Associations annual meeting The boards decisions in MB Sturgis Inc and Jeffboat Division American Commercial Marine Service Co involving temporary workers give rise to complicated bargaining situations but I think collective bargaining is vibrant enough if done in good faith to achieve results NLRB Chairman Hurtgen says Part of the difficulty in situations involving temporary workers is created by the unions and employers themselves trying to decide whether including or excluding temps is to their sides advantage he adds Hurtgen says the boards unanimous ruling in Lee Lumber and Bldg Material Corp reflects a good result of board decisionmaking in which the board tried to fashion an easytouse rule in an area that involves unstable difficult factual analysis He speculates that future boards may fashion similar rules in other situations where good faith bargaining is ordered When

Civ LMM The suit was brought against United Healthcare and its affiliates by health plan participants including participants in American Airlines employee health plan the American Medical Association the Medical Society of the State of New York the Missouri State Medical Association and two medical care providers who treated plan participants as outofnetwork providers The suit alleged that although United Healthcare is obligated to collect and maintain usual customary and reasonable data to support its decision to reimburse outofnetwork physicians it does not in fact possess UCR data to substantiate its claims that certain fees are greater than the usual and customary charge for such treatment and cannot justify reimbursement at the lower rates that United Healthcare had been

ON FORUM FOR INJURED DECKHANDS CLAIMS The US Supreme Court hears oral argument in a case involving an injured deckhand who wants to pursue a state court personal injury suit under the Jones Act and a shipowner who wants instead to proceed with a Limitation of Liability Act suit in federal court Lewis v Lewis Clark Marine Inc US No James Lewis claims he injured his back while working aboard a tugboat owned by Lewis Clark Marine Inc on the Mississippi River The company sued in federal court in Missouri under the Limitation Act which allows shipowners to limit their liability to the value of the shipowners interest in the vessel and its freight if the damage or injury occurred without the shipowners knowledge Lewis then sued in an Illinois state court bringing Jones Act and other claims Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Limitation Act suits which do not allow jury trials but the savings to suitors clause allows claimants to keep access to all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled under other statutes or common law The Eighth Circuit blocked Lewiss state court suit finding the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction His attorney argues to the Supreme Court that the state suit should proceed and only if the judgment exceeds the value of the vessel and its freight should the company be able to go to federal court to limit the judgment Page

FINAL HELPERS RULE The Department of Labor releases a final rule to amend DavisBacon Act regulations to allow contractors on federal and federally assisted construction projects to use helpers when that practice prevails in an area The final rule is scheduled for publication in the Nov Federal Register The final rule states that a distinct classification of helper will be issued in wage determinations applicable to work performed on construction projects covered by the labor standards provisions of the DavisBacon and Related Acts The agency says however that the classification will apply only where i the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as a trainee in an informal training program A union attorney expresses doubt the rule will succeed in setting any helper determination while a

delay in obtaining a desired transfer in the absence of some other negative or unfavorable effect from the delay constitutes an adverse action Judge Anderson writes for the court The only consequence of the transfer delay the court finds was that Amro was forced to face unpleasant and vulgar encounters with his supervisor The supervisors conduct however was not itself sufficiently negative and

ILLEGALLY OUSTED ALPA WORKERS FROM PROFITSHARING Cargo airline Atlas Air Inc violated the Railway Labor Act by excluding pilots and flight engineers from participation in a profitsharing plan for the sole reason that they voted for union representation the District of Columbia Circuit rules Atlas Air Inc v Air Line Pilots Assn DC Cir No Reversing a district courts grant of summary judgment to Atlas Air the appeals court acknowledges that employers covered by the act may change working conditions when no bargaining contract exists between the parties However Judge Sentelle decides where the challenged modification to the status quo is far from merely formal and is in fact the equivalent of a substantial decrease in compensation having a real and material impact on the conditions of employment and is justified on no other grounds than union certification we may presume that the carriers actions were motivated by antiunion animus and are in violation of RLA Section Third and Fourth Atlas Air sued for a declaratory judgment that its exclusion of some newly unionized pilots and flight engineers from the profitsharing plan was legal and that it could make more changes in employment conditions before collective bargaining began The Air Line Pilots Association counterclaimed alleging the airline interfered with workers right to organize Page AA ipBNAdlrnsfidaarkj PROBE

disciplined the board says that the process still had the potential of interfering with their rights to engage in protected activity under Section of the National Labor Relations Act Clearly Consolidated Diesel Cos requiring employees who engage in protected concerted activity to submit to a process with the potential for interrogation about protected activity discipline discharge and permanent documentation simply because some person at one time claimed to be harassed by that activity has a reasonable tendency to restrain the exercise of Section rights Chairman Truesdale and
