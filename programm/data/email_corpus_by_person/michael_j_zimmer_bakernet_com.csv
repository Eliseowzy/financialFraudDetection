in global energy and public utility law November FERC OFFERS FURTHER GUIDANCE ON RTOs Earlier this month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC or Commission issued an Order Providing Guidance on Continued Processing of RTO Filings RTO Guidance Order This order was issued by the FERC in response to the RTO development efforts in the United States and comments received by the Commission at the public conferences held at the FERC from October through the open Commission meeting on October and the Western Regional Infrastructure Workshop in Seattle Washington on November Elements of RTO Development The RTO Guidance Order states that further development and eventual completion of the RTO process will occur along two parallel tracks before the Commission One track will address scope and governance issues through the pending RTO dockets following consultation with state commissioners The other track will address business and process issues through the transmission tariff and market design rulemaking in Docket No RM The RTO Guidance Order also provided important details concerning key elements of the RTO development process Specifically the Commission will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on terms and conditions of interconnection services during January and a separate NOPR on interconnection pricing issues by April use the pending RTO dockets to address current and future proposals for fulfilling the eight Order No RTO Functions including the numerous business models proposed for the administration of critical wholesale market operations create statefederal RTO panels to promote dialogue on RTO development between the Commission and state commissions actively seek advice from state commissioners concerning the composition of regional markets meet with investor representatives to better understand the financing of independent transmission companies and transmission construction perform addition costbenefit analyses on RTOs to guide its efforts and to provide a quantitative basis for the appropriate number of RTOs New Policy Shift The Commission has officially abandoned its December deadline for RTO operation and will instead issue orders addressing pending RTO filings only after receiving comments from the appropriate state regional panels Future RTO progress in each region will be governed by timelines to be established in future Commission orders RTOs will be based on a sound business plan with substantive buyin from a crosssection of market participants With respect to the West the RTO Guidance Order commented favorably upon the development of three Western subregional organizations bound by a workable seams agreement and operating under a larger umbrella organization The terms of the RTO Guidance Order reflect the Commissions reaction to the drastic changes occurring in the electric power industry since the issuance of Order No in December The cumulative and ongoing effects of the California crisis including PGEs bankruptcy and the bitter El Paso Natural Gas Company litigation uncertainties in gas and power trading markets and the business and regulatory factors underlying the tremendous disparity in levels of RTO development have influenced and will continue to influence Commission activity in this area In stark opposition to the mandates of the past summer the RTO Guidance Order depicts a Commission committed to pragmatic cautious implementation of strategy devised through cooperation and collaboration with the states and industry Future Commission action in RTO development will likely reflect conclusions reached through consensus and development that will increase the likelihood of substantive success and importantly more broadly disperse the political risk and emphasize increased market transparency to mitigate the volatility that has drastically shortened the time window for business failure in the electric power industry from a matter of years to a matter of weeks The Commission will likely continue to investigate and respond to market activity and trends during future RTO development This FERC order comes at a unique and pivotal moment in RTO development and will have an immediate and direct commercial impact upon business activities in the electric power industry The Commissions next phases of RTO development will dictate business strategy for much of the foreseeable future and will have substantial and unprecedented impact upon the development of electric power markets and businesses operating in those regional markets well
