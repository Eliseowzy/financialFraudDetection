New England Inc and PJM Interconnection LLC together with ALSTOM ESCA Corporation a systems developer for electric utilities today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets but will lead they believe to the standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country Today ISO New England delivered a letter to the Chairman and Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC enclosing a report concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient features of the PJM market model with elements of its own existing wholesale market design The combination would create a standardized wholesale market structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesale electricity markets Standard Market Design ISO New England ALSTOM ESCA and PJM acting through its whollyowned subsidiary PJM Technologies Inc have agreed to proceed with the negotiation of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existing PJM market design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM The two ISOs and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardized market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch This new market standard should put into place the necessary market improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost

issues will eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closer together ISO New England and the New York ISO will continue to work together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on January Because of our geographic location New York is in the center of the Northeast markets with ISO New England PJM and IMO each on one of our borders We support the continued elimination of

developed jointly with stakeholder input ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Design to the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the New England Power Pool in a series of meetings next week Additional meetings will be conducted in the next few weeks The Standard Market Design for New England will be subject to FERC approval Standardization requires consistent

ISO New England and PJM Interconnection Propose a Standard Market Design for Wholesale Electricity Markets March HOLYOKE MA Two of the countrys leading wholesale electricity market administrators ISO New England Inc and PJM Interconnection LLC together with ALSTOM ESCA Corporation a systems developer for electric utilities today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets but will lead they believe to the standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country Today ISO New England delivered a letter to the Chairman and Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC enclosing a report concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient features of the PJM market model with elements of its own existing wholesale market design The combination would create a standardized wholesale market structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesale electricity markets Standard Market Design ISO New England ALSTOM ESCA and PJM acting through its whollyowned subsidiary PJM Technologies Inc have agreed to proceed with the negotiation of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existing PJM market design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM The two ISOs and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardized market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch This new market standard should put into place the necessary market improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a customized market system for New England said William W Berry Chairman and Acting CEO of ISO New England Now is the time to stop the experimentation Ultimately we hope the Standard Market Design will serve as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country if not around the world PJM is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive wholesale electricity market said Phillip G Harris Chairman and CEO of PJM Along with the progress in the implementation of the PJM West concept this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design This approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers across different markets and promote FERCs goal of creating a seamless marketplace We intend to continue to work with the New York ISO on issues of mutual importance stated Mr Berry This new market design together with our efforts to address the market seams and other coordination issues will eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closer together ISO New England and the New York ISO will continue to work together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on January Because of our geographic location New York is in the center of the Northeast markets with ISO New England PJM and IMO each on one of our borders We support the continued elimination of barriers across Northeast trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit said William J Museler President and CEO of the New York Independent System Operator The New York ISO will continue to work with our neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger regional markets This proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with stakeholder input ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Design to the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the New England Power Pool in a series of meetings next week Additional meetings will be conducted in the next few weeks The Standard Market Design for New England will be subject to FERC approval Standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a markets efficiency A market that moderates price fluctuations and encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity said Alain Steven CEO of ALSTOM ESCA In the future this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets ISO New England Inc is the notforprofit corporation responsible for the daytoday reliable operation of New Englands bulk generation and transmission systems with an installed capacity of almost megawatts In addition to operating the bulk power grid ISO New England is the administrator of the regions wholesale electricity marketplace and the Open Access Transmission Tariff on behalf of the New England Power Pool ISO New England is based in Holyoke Massachusetts The PJM Interconnection LLC is an Independent System Operator administering the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff and operating the PJM Energy Markets and Capacity Markets PJM currently administers the largest wholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than It is headquartered in Norristown Pennsylvania PJM Technologies Inc is a whollyowned subsidiary of PJM Interconnection LLC designed to respond to market opportunities by bringing costeffective reliable solutions to the energy marketplace It was created to
