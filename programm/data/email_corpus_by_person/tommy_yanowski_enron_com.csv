<27145671.1075840851202.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tommy.yanowski@enron.com,2001-03-09 16:19:00,Possible Temporary Move of HPL to Three Allen Cc According to facilities the th floor of Three Allen will be available starting April st I just finished a walk through of the space and have the following comments about possibly moving HPL on to the floor It is a mezzanine type floor which has overhangs which are open to the elevator lobby down below Wed need to stick trading and logistics into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise There are currently only ports or network connections on the floor Wed need to pull additional cable to handle the approximately people that would need to be on the floor If we decide so to use the floor we could get this done within a couple of weeks at most The floor is set up with mostly offices and very few cubes Wed need to put together several people in each office to fit everyone into the space If we put more than one person in the office the fire code we require us to put a strobe in each office set up this way There is no telecom or wiring closet on the floor That means to make this work as is HPL would have to remain on our network and depend on us for telecom service via our Nortel switch during the stay in Three Allen since there would be nowhere for AEP to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out There is no set up for the IPC Trader phones and currently no room to add an IPC rack on the th floor telecom closet We would have to either knock out a wall on the th floor closet or tell the traders to live without recorded phone conversations The good news is that Keith Dziadek and his team have figured out a way to make the EOL connection with AEP work that will have minimal impact to EOL We could use this link for HPL to access their Trade Blotter Risk Systems and People Soft from AEP Bottom Line The space on is not ideal but it is available I will be receiving a floor plan today and will kindly forward a copy on to someone within your group to work with Bill Donovans group to see if there is anyway to get people on the floor There will be some costs to set things up like additional cabling and installing some additional desks or workstations If we decide that trader phones are necessary then we would have to expand the th floor wiring closet If we decide to do this we may need to purchase an IPC switch system and phones It cost me when I purchased an IPC system for Bridgeline I will also check to see if we have a switch anywhere that we could borrow for a few months We need to decide very quickly if this is what we want to do if we are shooting for having people over in Three Allen for the April Bid Week for May production We also need to talk about this additional cost with AEP and having them pick some or all of it up We also need to have AEP on board because they are building their side of the interfaces with our systems If the interfaces are not ready in time then the traders would need to enter trades into both Sitara and AEPs Risk System The bigger issue would be the interface with AEPs PeopleSoft system since they would be generating payments via this application The good news is that May production for physical trades will not settle until June giving them extra time to finish the interface Our side of the interfaces are pretty simple and I feel confident we will be ready to test in April Let me know if you need any additional information Tommy
<31236025.1075840851227.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tommy.yanowski@enron.com,2001-03-08 12:31:00,FW AEPpst It looks like EOL will have a full T link with AEP in place next week I will review this with Network Security and see if there are any issues AEP will still need to have their interfaces built and ready Enron should be ready to start testing our side by the end of this month and work out any issues in April I talked to Dawn Fournier about space in Three Allen and they are working on trying to free up a floor Currently there is not a whole floor available If they are successful then we will need to see what is currently set up on the floor and come up with the best plan for getting the space up and running ASAP To do so we may need to provide network and telephony services instead of waiting on AEP to build out their servers install a phone switch Let me know if there are any questions Tommy Original Message From Hillier Bob Sent Thursday March AM To Yanowski Tommy J Subject RE AEP I am pretty sure that it is a full T Hopefully the routing will be worked out next week The only thing left would be to make sure that the EOL business folks are OK with using it for this as well as the direct connect to EOL I will pass this by Bob Shults who is heading up this project bbh Original Message From Yanowski Tommy J Sent Thursday March AM To Hillier Bob Subject RE AEP I believe Louise would like to close by May but that would mean needing the link in place by early April so that we could test and be ready to go April Bid Week for May production Do you know what the size of the link is Is it a full T Thanks for all of your help I hate to bother you but Louise and Skillings want to close ASAP Enron must need the cash Tommy Original Message From Hillier Bob Sent Wednesday March PM To Yanowski Tommy J Subject AEP It does not look like AEP has its link up yet The last note I got said that they were still working on some routing issues What is your timeline for this look like bbh
