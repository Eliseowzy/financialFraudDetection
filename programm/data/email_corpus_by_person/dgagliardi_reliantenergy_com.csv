Subject FW Inside Texas FaxEmail Service Inside Texas Fax Service Vol No Monday Aug Insidetx Inc W Anderson Austin TX for faxes by email Its hard to remember a running back in the state of Texas who has entered his senior season with more incredible publicity than Midland Lees Cedric Benson who committed to Texas Thursday night ending months of sometimes frenzied speculation about his plans and the plans of the Texas coaching staff with regard to him Just as an example hes on the cover of Dave Campbells all by himself a first for a highschooler in the year history of that venerable magazine and hes got high school coaches showering him with praise some calling him the best high school running back theyve ever seen Which is why after talking to him I came away so impressed by his maturity and seeming levelheadedness about the whole thing He answered my questions in a thoughtful and articulate manner and seemed pretty unfazed by the hype This is a young man who cares as much about his performance in the classroom as on the field and he appears to be doing a helluva job in both In short Benson looks like exactly the type of player and person with whom Mack Brown wants to build his program I caught up with Cedric last Saturday afternoon after his Lee team had traveled hours roundtrip by bus to El Paso for a Friday scrimmage So what was it about the Longhorns that made you decide to finally commit to them Benson Theyre doing a great job of recruiting both offensively and defensively Theyve recruited great quarterbacks and receivers so I feel like all they need is a great running back and well be pretty balanced Here at Lee thats how weve been the last couple of years which has enabled us to win state championships and I feel like with a balanced offense nobody will be able to stop us Were you keeping up with the job Texas has been doing recruiting offensive lineman this summer and did that play any role in your decision Benson Yeah definitely Obviously youve been the subject of a huge amount of publicity what with being on the cover of Dave Campbells and having various high school coaches calling you the best high school back theyve ever seen How have you reacted to that Benson I take it as a big compliment when you get coaches at a high level saying that you are a great athlete its just a great compliment but its my job not to let it go to my head Ive still got a lot of work to do here at Lee both schoolwise and footballwise before I go off to school Speaking of Lee back to back state titles thats amazing Do you think youve got a team this season that can make it a threepeat Benson Yeah with a lot of dedication and hard work we can do it again Do you have any personal goals for yourself this season Benson My main goal is just to win and I want to make straight As Ive been thinking about that a lot So you dont get too caught up in the rushing titles and the touchdown records and so forth Benson No because those come along with winning you know If I get out there and work real hard and the team works real hard and we win then I will maybe come out of the game with yards or yards rushing and three or four touchdowns so that just comes along with winning How would you describe your running style what are youre strengths Benson I dont really think I could compare myself to anybody else Im a pretty balanced act I can run my strength is good I can catch and I have good vision Are you featured much out of the backfield at Lee Benson Yeah we do a lot of rollout passes and a lot of screen passes So have the Texas coaches talked to you about how they see you fitting into their offensive scheme Benson No not really and I didnt really question them about it either because Im pretty sure they are focused on what theyve gotta do right now but well talk more about football later What are your physical numbers right now Benson Im probably around right now and about pounds I run a on the track and a on grass So you are done with recruiting and are solid for Texas Benson Yeah I am Im glad to get it all over with and just be a kid again for my last year Finally is there anything youd like to tell the Texas fans out there about yourself as you head into your senior season and beyond that at UT Benson I just want them to know theyll be getting a great guy and a hard football player Pearle Practice notes After a lackluster scrimmage performance Saturday at DKR the Texas offense returned to the field Monday morning with a renewed vigor For probably the first time all fall the offensive players made more noise than their defensive counterparts hooting and hollering after every big offensive play Brett Robin and BJ Johnson provided the biggest screaminducing plays Robin with a barreling draw play run that left Greg Brown flat on his back and Johnson with a catchandrun TD from Major where he outleapt and then outran defender Nathan Vasher After reevaluating the scrimmage and our staff meeting yesterday we felt like that there was more intensity on defense than there was on offense Mack Brown said The offense though came out today and fought back and had some intensity Carl Reese said after practice that he expects Kalen Thornton to see action at RDE in the opener vs LouisianaLafayette The Dcoordinator said hes pleased with the play of Jermain Anderson as the starter at the position but the coaches plan to keep him fresh which Reese says keeps him effective by rotating players in including Cole Pittman and Thornton Speaking of Pittman he saw a lot of work today at LDE because Cory Redding sat out with a sore knee and sore shoulder Brown said Redding would miss Wednesdays final scrimmage and possibly return for Thursdays workout Derrick Dockery has an infected cyst on as Brown put it his rear end and missed Mondays workouts The coach said Dockery is running a fever and is feeling very sick and probably wont be back until next week Tillman Holloway took the firstteam snaps at LG in Dockerys place Ervis Hill did not practice again today because of his sore knee The Texas doctors believe there is not any serious damage to the knee but he will miss the scrimmage Wednesday before possibly returning Thursday Courtnee Garcia hamstring pull participated in pass drills for the first time since last week but still didnt practice full speed Ross ContentType applicationmsword nameFaxprdoc

Volume FaxEMail Wednesday August Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Have Final Public Scrimmage Before Huge Crowd Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a short but spirited scrimmage Wednesday night in Royal Memorial Stadium before an enthusiastic crowd UT officials estimated at about With the firstteam defense sitting out most of the scrimmage the offenses dominated most of the way Chris Simms hit of passes for yards including a yard touchdown pass to freshman sensation Roy Williams who had set up the score with a great catch of a yard Simms throw and a yard TD pass to WR Montrell Flowers off a fake reverse The firstteam offense also scored on a twoyard run by TB Victor Ike after starting TB Hodges Mitchell set it up with a yard gallop But QB Major Applewhite led the secondteam offense to two touchdowns hitting of for yards including scoring tosses of yards to the other sensational freshman WR B J Johnson and yards to senior Brandon Healy Applewhites TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and Johnson just ran away from all the pursuit Starting safety Greg Brown intercepted one of Applewhites throws on the secondteams first possession Brown still wouldnt give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the season opener next week but did say both QBs played well Brown also said I was really pleased with the wide receivers I thought they made some steps in running better routes and making the tough catches He also said Ike is clearly the No TB behind Mitchell at this point Redshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring but has not been dominating during the current practices He also has had some nagging injuries Brown said Ike the fastest of the tailbacks has been doing well in practice Victor has been doing the best since hes been here Brown said He is doing much better without the ball blocking than he has in the past Defensive coordinator Carl Reese who has nine starters back says he is feeling better about his new defensive ends Ive got four guys I think can play Reese said Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters and Kaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job He just keeps getting better so hell be the first backup for Anderson and Cole Pittman has had three solid scrimmages in a row so hell be the guy behind Redding I think all four of them will play a lot and theyre the four main ones right now Thornton a true freshman is one of the larger DEs at about but Reese said he is pretty quick out there He gets a good rush from the edge and thats what we like He also is learning to do a better job against the run He said Pittman who was moved over from tackle to provide better run support has been doing a good job against the run and hes a pretty good pass rusher too I think well be okay with those four guys as soon as they get a little more experience Brown said the team will have one more open practice and it will be Thursday at at Denius Field Then he plans to give the team three days off to try to let the players recover from the grueling twoaday workouts The team will go back to work Monday to get ready for the Saturday opener at am against LouisianaLafayette INJURY UPDATE Brown said OT Mike Williams suffered a twisted leg in the scrimmage but he said he didnt think it was serious RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns still have commitments DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn who will take his official visit to Texas the Sept weekend rushed times for yards and completed of passes for yards and two TDs to lead his team to a victory over

over LouisianaLafayette for Saturdays am season opener in Austin For those of you who dont live in Austin and who plan to come to the game this is the hottest summer I have seen in Austin with temperatures hitting and with disturbing regularity so I would advise you to wear something cool and arrange to have plenty of liquids to drink The team returned to practice Monday after getting three days off to recuperate from adays and freshman WR Roy Williams made a spectacular catch of a ball that looked like it was over everyone Coach Mack Brown said he wont name a starting quarterback publicly until the game starts and wont even break the news to Major Applewhite and Chris Simms the two quarterbacks who are competing for the starting job until Saturday morning We want to watch them in practice all week Brown said He also said both QBs are working hard and competing for the starting job We have told our team we have two starters Brown said We are just happy they are both really good In making these decisions we will try to take care of both of them and do what is best for the team All of the injured starters who missed some time last week were back at practice Monday but they didnt run with the first team Brown said as of today redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway would start at left guard because Derrick Dockery missed most of last week sophomore Cole Pittman would start ahead of Cory Redding at DE because Redding was injured last week and Roderick Babers who is locked in a battle with Ervis Hill at CB would get the nod because Hill missed some workouts with an injury But the game isnt today and Brown said the players who were hurt will have an opportunity this week to regain their starting jobs Brown also said he hasnt decided whether to start any true freshmen and said he probably wont make a final decision on that until close to game time too because sometimes you tell a freshman he is going to start and he starts hyperventilating Whether or not they start freshman WRs Williams and B J Johnson will play early and often They are the most impressive freshmen wide receivers I have seen at Texas Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney were a very good pair but Williams and Johnson look better and Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery the other two freshmen WRs arent too far behind Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also says freshman CB Nathan Vasher and freshman DE Kalen Thornton will play Saturday RECRUITING NOTES Greg Barnum the center from Killeen Ellison who left Tennesse and considered transferring to Texas enrolled at Stephen F Austin and says he plans to stay there for the remainder of his career DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn says he is still planning to take his official visit to Texas this weekend and super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison heads the list of high school stars who plan to come to the UT game on unofficial visits Shreveport Evangels game winning streak ended Saturday when Marrero Shaw took a victory Evangel QB Brett Rawls completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns in a losing effort Rawls and Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch are UTs top QB targets this recruiting season BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorn women got a commitment Monday from the states top prospect Heather Schrieber a forward from Windthrost a small town near Wichita Falls Schrieber who had offers from top schools all over the country after a great summer season in AAU ball had narrowed her choices to Texas and Iowa State and she visited the Cyclones last weekend then came home and called the Texas coaches to say she wants to play for the Longhorns I just really like Texas she said Joel Nelson of Flower Mound who coached her in AAU play this summer said Heather is a great player She can bring the ball down court she hit of her threepointers for us and she was the best player on an AAU team that finished fourth in the country She could play guard forward or center at the college level and be very good at any of those positions I know teams like Texas Tech Arkansas Iowa State and several others wanted her too I think shes the best player in the state He said she averaged points rebounds and assists in a game AAU

question he said We are not likely to start a true freshman but several of them will get into the game pretty quickly WRs Roy Williams and B J Johnson DE Kalen Thornton DT Stevie Lee and CB Nathan Vasher are the freshmen who are most likely to see quick action Brown said redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway probably will start at left guard but he said Derrick Dockery who had been starting before missing some practice because of a large cyst will play a lot too Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said sophomore DE Cole Pittman has been playing really well If he keeps playing like he has well probably move him over to the other end as the starter and have Jermain Anderson be a swing guy who can substitute at either end Pittman has been backing up Cory Redding at right end He might start at right end Saturday because Redding also has missed some practice with a knee sprain But Reese said Redding and Pittman are my two best ends right now so I might move Pittman Im still not happy with the end play but well keep working on it Texas has nine defensive starters back but the two regulars who graduated were DEs Aaron Hmphrey and Cedric Woodard Brown said he is pleased with the team leadership on defense and he said the offense seems to be developing more leadership He also said he is pleased with the way the team has worked in the record heat in Austin on Monday and on Tuesday

to miss the game Scaife is out for the season after undergoing knee surgery in late August and Thompson will miss most or all of the season after undergoing knee surgery following spring practice

Orange FaxEMail Service Volume FaxEMail Tuesday September Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Simms Working as First Team QB Horns Get Pledge from Tyler DB Sophomore QB Chris Simms worked with the first team during Tuesdays practice and if past practices mean anything that is a pretty good sign that he will start Saturday night against Houston Simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the start Junior Major Applewhite worked with the first team prior to the Stanford game and he got the start Coach Mack Brown wont say who will start at quarterback but it doesnt make a lot of sense to have your starting QB working with the second team so it looks like Simms will get his second start Saturday Simms is more mobile than Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery and he also led the Horns to their first touchdown Saturday at Stanford despite only getting snaps to Applewhites Applewhite led the Longhorns to their other two touchdowns but they were both in the fourth quarter Brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the Texas fans who are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk shows are hurt Thats the way we feel too Our players are hurt and our coaches are hurt None of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times But he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense rolling again and shore up the punting team after Stanford scored a touchdown on a blocked punt Brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its punter up shorter than usual Hes yards back just like every other team in the country and we try to get the punt off in seconds or less He got the one that was blocked off in seconds but a kid who blocked it perfectly on the other punts let his guy come through untouched and it got blocked The Longhorns may have some other punts blocked but my sources tell me Brown chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make that same mistake again Folks I guarantee you Brown his assistants and his players are more upset than any of you over the happenings at Palo Alto and they are working hard this week to correct things Remember the guy the stadium was named after was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in years at Texas Bobby Bowden is a pretty good coach too and his perfect season at Florida State last year was his first one TB Hodges Mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against Stanford and the coaches have corrected that Brown also said backup TB Victor Ike will play more Saturday than he has been playing and he said redshirt freshman Kenny Hayter also might see considerable action Were going to play as many as it takes Brown said We have to get our running game going better He also said LG Derrick Dockery might be able to return to fulltime duty Saturday He has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized for an infected cyst That would help us a lot he said Derrick is one of our top offensive linemen Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson will start at strong safety Saturday in place of Lee Jackson who has a pulled hamstring and will miss the Houston game Reese said Pearson has a lot of talent but he said Jacksons experience will be missed Reese also said he will look at freshman Nathan Vasher and juniors Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill to replace Pearson in the Longhorns nickel and dime packages He said the team will play with five and six defensive backs a lot Saturday because Houston will throw it about times ANOTHER RECRUIT COMMITS Texas has commitments now after getting a pledge from Tyler CB Aaron Ross Ross had offers from Alabama Arkansas Baylor LSU Oklahoma Texas AM and others but said he committed to Texas because Ive always been a Longhorrn fan and I really like the Texas coaches He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who recruited him and he said Withers the Texas secondary coach came to see him play in his second game this season He is a big fast corner with long arms but dont look for him to get many interceptions this year because he hasnt had a pass thrown in his direction all year because he is so good at tight manforman coverage My next fax will be

Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Bound for Holiday Bowl to Face Oregon or Oregon State The Longhorns accepted a bid Wednesday to play in the Friday Dec Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego and their opponent will be either Oregon or Oregon State Both Oregon teams shared the Pac title with Washington which is playing Purdue in the Rose Bowl Oregon State will be the Longhorns opponent unless the Beavers get a berth in one of the BCS bowls probably the Fiesta If OSU gets a Fiesta bid then Texas would play Oregon The Holiday Bowl kickoff will be at pm Texas time Longhorn fans can purchase tickets by calling the UT Ticket Office at BEVO or local fans can call If anyone wants to buy tickets in person the ticket office is located on the first floor in Bellmont Hall Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns are excited about accepting this invitation and he said they are also excited about playing either of the Oregon teams because both are ranked in the top Brown also said the game should help Texas recruiting efforts in California and throughout the Pac area because of its location and he also said it should help recruiting nationally because it is a nationally televised ESPN game that does not compete with any other game that evening Brown said the Longhorns will resume practice on Dec but he said some of the coaches will work with some of the players next week Most of the coaches are on the road recruiting this week and many of them will be out again next week Recruiting is our top priority right now Brown said Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said QB Major Applewhite should be close to by Dec but neither he nor Brown would indicate whether Applewhite will get his starting job back or if the nod will go to sophomore Chris Simms who was sensational in leading the Longhorns to a win over archrival Texas AM last Friday My crystal ball tells me it will be Simms because a he had a great game in his last outing and b he is completely healthy while there will be some questions about Applewhites sore knee until he actually takes a lick on it I also think the coaches would feel more comfortable with the idea of Applewhite relieving Simms if Simms had problems than they would be with Simms handling the pinchhitting role FOOTBALL NOTES Brown said he will use the bowl practices to take a closer look at several of the freshman who have been redshirted He said he usually watches them during the season but said so many of the freshmen were playing regularly that the coaches were spending an abnormal amount of time getting them ready which prevented him from seeing as much of the redshirts as he would have liked He said FB Will Matthews and TB Sneezy Beltran are two freshmen he wants to take a good look at to see if they can help the team next year Both Matthews and Beltran have been very impressive on the scout team and Brown is looking for a TB to replace senior Hodges Mitchell and he also wants to give Matthews a shot at competing with FB Matt Trissel FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES The private schools in Texas generally arent the ones who produce top talent for the colleges but two freshmen TE Brock Edwards of Fort Worth Christian and DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St Marks started several games for Texas this year There are some top seniors at the private schools again this year headed by DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas Jesuit There also is a junior QB at Midland Christian who will be hearing from some of the top colleges next year He is Jamie Beeghley He led Midland Christian to the state title last week and hit of passes for yards and ran for more yards in the championship game victory over Fort Worth Christian This year was the year of the offensive linemen which was great for the Longhorns because they needed to sign five or six really good ones and they already have been assured of filling that need Next year probably will be the year of the defensive linemen and that is very good for Texas because the Horns need to sign a bunch of them Ive already seen four or five who would be top recruits this year if they were seniors I mentioned several of them in my last emailfax and Ill write more about them

that he signed following the season He will have eight years remaining on the million per year contract Mack has done a terrific job for The University of Texas our Athletics Department and the football program Dodds said We are extremely proud of everything he his staff and the studentathletes have accomplished and are excited about our future It is very important that the head football coach at Texas remains in the upper echelon of coaching compensation which is an everchanging dynamic Dodds said This raise is in response to the current demand in the coaching marketplace and a welldeserved reward for Macks hard work and dedication We are thrilled with the direction he has taken our football program and look forward to a longlasting relationship Brown has led the Horns to three straight ninewin seasons for the first time since and is guiding UT to a thirdstraight bowl game for just the second time since The No Longhorns will face the No Oregon Ducks at the Culligan

coaches also are in line for raises Football raises about million of the entire million budget for all the mens and womens athletic programs It is the only program that shows a profit Baseball and mens and womens basketball are the only other major revenue sports and none of them produce as much revenue as they spend FOOTBALL NOTES Longhorn ticket sales are lagging for the Holiday Bowl are lagging and Oregon fans are snapping up some of the tickets that were allotted to Texas fans If Longhorn fans dont step up quickly Oregon fans are going to occupy the vast majority of the seats in San Diego on Dec The Longhorns begin practicing for the bowl game Thursday All the practices will be closed to the public Former Longhorn and pro football great Harley Sewell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this week Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis who missed most of this season with a sore shin will get a look at TE in spring practice With the emergence of freshman receivers Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas the pound Ellis might have a better chance of seeing meaningful playing time by beefing up a little and playing tight end Another spring move that is being contemplated is seeing if sophomore LG Derrick Dockery could move over to LT to replace departing senior Leonard Davis Texas has three good guards in Dockery Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway Mike Williams is the only returning tackle who has seen a lot of action In addition to getting the best five linemen on the field at the same time that move might give the offensive line more fire because Holloway is a very aggressive lineman The offensive line has frequently been cited as lacking fire and leadership FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns are having their annual football banq uet this weekend Most of the players making official visits will be players who already are committed to Texas but there are at least two exceptions OL William Winston of Houston Madison and S Rufus Harris of La Porte are both scheduled to visit Super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco now says he is going to take all of his visits in January Texas leads for Winston and Johnson and it it a UTAM battle

score Davis said he will be in a Longhorn uniform this fall If he doesnt well thats why he signed a letter of intent with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College a Mississippi junior college Thats my backup plan Davis said I dont know yet what I am going to do Davis has enough core courses to qualify and just needs a qualifying test score Greg Barnum the Killeen Ellison center who was being touted as an AllAmerica prospect at Tennessee this season before quitting the team says he probably will enroll at Texas or Stephen F Austin in September to continue his football career Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release Barnum to Texas but has said he will release him to Stephen F Austin Without a release Barnum would have to pay his own way for a year if he enrolls at Texas Id like to see somebody challenge a coachs right to refuse to release a kid Scholarships are renewable now on a yeartoyear basis so Fulmer or any other coach can get rid of a player by simply refusing to renew his scholarship If a school can fire a player then its only fair that a player be able to fire the school I know its an NCAA rule but there is a thing called the U S Constitution that takes precedence over NCAA rules Texas has two great DTs in AllAmerica Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers but there is one at Blinn JC who might be just as good He is Paul Broussard formerly of La Porte which is Shaun Rogers home town too Broussard was a great DT as a sophomore at La Porte when he weighed about but he ballooned up to well over pounds as a junior and senior and was not as dominating He is about and was back in the pound range last year as a freshman at Blinn and he was outstanding Hes working in Austin this summer If his academics are in order lets hope Alfio Randall the big OT at Blinn who plans to enroll at UT next January can talk Broussard into coming along with him RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns have apparently stepped up their recruiting of running backs In addition to offering Anthony Johnson of Jefferson last week the UT coaches are now actively recruiting Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who is on the cover of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazine and Jabari Davis of Tucker Ga Six Longhorn recruits were scheduled to play in the AllStar game in California Saturday night but WR B J Johnson of South Grand Prairie is nursing a sprained ankle and had to withdraw In addition to Sonny Davis the other future Longhorns are WRs Roy Williams of Odessa Permian and Sloan Thomas of Klein DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St Marks and center Jason Glynn of Richardson Berkner That game is supposed to kick off at about pm Texas time and is supposed to be televised by Fox in most areas of Texas FOOTBALL NOTES Another internet rumor that has no substance but has great interest for Longhorns and Red Raiders is the one that has former Tech coach Spike Dykes going to work for Texas Since Spike is still under contract with the Red Raiders it would cost him well into six figures to go to work for the Longhorns It might happen down the road but not anytime soon I normally dont comment on internet rumors but I have had so many queries about Sonny Davis and Spike Dykes that I just decided to give the facts to all of you Sophomore DE Adam McConathy who weighed about last season is up to pounds and hasnt lost any of his speed He is battling Jermain Anderson and Maurice Gordon for the starting job at right end All three are outstanding pass rushers and the coaches want them to get a little bigger so they can do a better job against the run If Sonny Davis does wind up going to a junior college freshman Stevie Lee and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs will back up Hampton and Rogers at DT this year and they will be the guys to beat for the starting jobs in Barring an injury I dont think anyone will beat out Stevie Lee My next fax will be whenever events warrant The True Orange Fax Service includes at least faxes a year and costs by EMail The True Orange Newsletter includes

committed to the Longhorns Wednesday Johnson a hardhitting safety who had tackles last season for the Trojans who had one of the top defenses in the DallasFort Worth area is moving to quarterback this season His father David told me his son decided to commit to the Longhorns because the Texas coaches really impressed him with their coaching methods and with the classy way they operate They were very open and very straightforward David Johnson said his son also attended a TCU camp this summer and went to a Texas AM camp last summer He said several schools called his son in May the month the NCAA allows schools to make one phone call to each recruit He said calls came from coaches at Notre Dame Oklahoma Nebraska Arkansas TCU and others but he said his son decided to commit to Texas and get the recruiting process behind him so he could concentrate on his senior season Braden Johnson has strong athletic blood lines David Johnson was on a football scholarship at Oklahoma State when he suffered a careerending shoulder injury and David has two famous uncles for oldtime football fans One is Bill Johnson who had a year career as a player and coach with the San Francisco ers and who also coached with Paul Brown on the Cleveland Browns staff The other is Gil Johnson the quarterback on the great SMU teams that featured Doak Walker and Kyle Rote Braden Johnson is a threesport star He plays centerfield in baseball and runs on the meter relay in track He also is a good student Johnson is the fifth high school star to commit to Texas this month The others are WRDB Brian Carter of The Woodlands and OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls In addition Alfio Randall a super OL recruit a year ago is on track to graduate from Blinn JC in December and he told me he will enroll at Texas in January All five of the high school prospects who committed did so after attending one of the Longhorns summer camps Scott and Robinson are on virtually all of the national top lists RECRUITING NOTES The top running back and the top quarterback in Texas both say they would like to commit early and the Longhorns are in strong contention for both The RB is Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who rushed for yards and touchdowns in leading Lee to a season and its second straight Class A state championships Both those incredible totals are Class A records The QB is Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch who threw for yards as a sophomore before suffering a broken collarbone last season that knocked him out of his teams final five games He still passed for yards The Longhorns already have commitments from two of the members of the Super Team in Dave Campbells Texas Football Magazine They are Scott and Robinson The only other member of the Super Team who has committed is Madisonville RB David Underwood the Aggies No RB target who announced last week that he is going to be a Michigan Wolverine Allen made the second team and Carter made the third team There are at least five super players I have seen who will be big recruiting targets next year Thats right they were so good as sophomores that every school in the country already knows about them They are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village DL Marco Martin of Mesquite DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and TEOL Eric Winston of Midland Lee Young ran for yards last year in a tough district Young threw for yards and ran for more as a sophomore also in a tough league Martin is so agile that he also plays fullback and so quick that hes a terrific pass rusher and run stopper Leitko was a dominating force as a sophomore last year on The Woodlands playoff team Winston is a great athlete who was one of the stars on Lees title team as a sophomore Leitko and Young came to Texas summer camp earlier this month In the didyouknow department Nebraska was in the last seven football seasons That makes the

Texas AM several weeks ago switched his pledge to Texas Monday and his coach Mike Coker said the switch is final Its a done deal Coker said Coker said Garcia and his mother visited the Texas campus last week on an unofficial visit and met with some of the Texas coaches Hes a little embarrassed about the whole situation Coker said but he said he felt it was something he had to do Coker said he discussed the situation with coaches at Texas and AM before announcing Garcias change of heart Garcia was the highest rated of the Aggies three early commitments Coker said Garcia felt very comfortable with Mack Brown his staff and the atmosphere at the University of Texas Garcia is the seventh high school player to commit to Texas this month In addition Alfio Randall a star OT at Blinn JC says he will come to Texas in January after he graduates from Blinn The other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands Scott and Robinson are on all of the early national top recruiting lists With six top offensive linemen already committed counting Randall the Longhorns are on the way to signing an awesome group to fill their greatest need in this recruiting class Top offensive and defensive linemen have been in short supply in Texas since Brown arrived but this years offensive line class is very deep in talented players The Longhorns are still in strong contention for two other top offensive linemen Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison Hightower drove to Nebraska for an unofficial weekend visit and after the hour return trip said today he had a great time and said Nebraska Texas and AM are his big three Winston also likes AM and Texas but is considering several outofstate schools BARNUM UPDATE Greg Barnum the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year took a tour of the Texas campus last week and he liked what he saw Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release so far which would force him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand But Barnums attorney has written a letter to Tennessee officials demanding a release NCAA rules require colleges and their recruits to honor the letter of intent recruits sign for one year But the rules give the college coach a big advantage after the first year in that he can refuse to renew the scholarship or as in Barnums case refuse to allow the kid to get an immediate scholarship at another school The NCAA has some rules that probably violate the U S Constitution and this would seem to be one of them Back when colleges gave kids fouryear scholarships it might have been fair to give coaches the right to deny an outright release to unhappy recruits but when the rules were changed to give oneyear scholarships that were renewable every year the coachs power was left unchanged I dont think the NCAA or Tennessee will want to see this come to court so if I was a gambling man I would be willing to bet a fair amount that young Mr Barnum gets his release if he keeps pushing If he comes to Texas he will have to sit out a year then will have three years of eligibility left BASEBALL NOTES The pros are still working to sign several current Longhorns and UT recruits but only three juniors second baseman Tommy Nicholson relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West have signed so far BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville The Longhorns were recruiting him but their primary target for their lone remaining scholarship is still T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge win the Class A state title Ford one of the nations top point guards is strongly considering the Longhorns Texas already has a commitment from center Chris Wright of

almost yards and nearly touchdowns between them last season but Texas does and UT has picked up a commitment from one of them and has a good chance to get a pledge from the other one this weekend QB Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship said he called coach Mack Brown late Tuesday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns Briles led Stephenville to the Class A State Championship last year but moved to the Lubbock area when his father Art Briles who coached Stephenville to three perfect seasons and state titles in the s took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech I called coach Brown last night and told him I was committing Briles said I have always liked Texas They have a great academic reputation and Im excited about playing for the Longhorns Briles was the Class A offensive player of the year and it is easy to understand why when you look at his statistics All he did last year offensively was complete of passes for yards and touchdowns and use his quick feet to run for more yards and more TDs Thats an incredible yards of offense and an equally incredible touchdowns The other half of that prolific duo is RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who ran for a Class A record yards and another record touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State Championship Benson is flying to Austin Saturday with his mother to meet with the UT coaches He is a longtime UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college this summer so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season I asked him if he will commit to Texas this weekend He replied Maybe Well see Benson also told me he runs a consistent on grass and has run a on a track When you add their junior statistics it comes out to yards and touchdowns I dont think there have ever been two players in the Texas high school ranks even in sixman footballs where yardage and touchdowns are the name of the game who have ever had offensive totals like that in a single season Class A and Class A include the largest schools in Texas and seasons like they had as juniors never happen in those classifications Benson rushed for more than yards his sophomore year in Lees championship season and led the Rebels to a perfect season in Briles who became the Longhorns th early commitment turned down an offer to be an option quarterback at Nebraska to be a safety at Texas He attended summer camps at both schools before selecting the Longhorns It was a wise choice if he wants a chance to play in the NFL There are some starting defensive backs in the NFL but there are no starting quarterbacks The Longhorns other commitments include MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park who switched from AM to Texas Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands QB Quon Cosby of Mart is another signal caller who will move to the defensive backfield in college He visited Texas last Wednesday and talked to Brown and several UT assistant coaches He said the Longhorn coaches offered him a scholarship and told him they want him to be a cornerback and kick returner In leading Mart to the Class A state title last year Cosby passed for yards and TDs ran for yards and scores and had nine

for the next two years Beltran is a good student who almost qualified on his first try at the ACT but he said he operates best under pressure and he proved it by waiting until the last possible date to take it again He is a full qualifier now and gives the Longhorns incoming scholarship recruits Texas actually has freshmen who have never redshirted on scholarship but three of them DT Stevie Lee and S Phillip Geiggar both of Shreveport Evangel and FB Tyrone Richardson of Clarksville enrolled last January so only scholarship freshmen will be reporting next month for the first time In addition to Davis the Longhorns lost DT Marcel Moses of Texas City to Kilgore JC Both Davis and Moses say they plan to come back to UT in two years after they graduate from junior college Lee looked like a future star in spring training but Texas really needs to sign some more defensive tackles because AllAmerican Casey Hampton and AllBig Shaun Rogers are both heading into their senior seasons The defensive tackle position in the Texas high school ranks is a true good news bad news story this year The good news is that Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is as good a DT prospect as there is in the country and he is a strong Texas lean The bad news is that there is no one else even close to him in the entire state So if the Horns get Harris they will have snared a great DT but if they dont they sure will need to get one who can play as a true freshman the following year RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who ran for a Class A record yards and another record touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State Championship had to cancel his unofficial visit to Texas last weekend He and his mother had planned to fly to Austin Saturday but they were flying standby and got

Kendrick Turner sophomore LB Jamal Joyner and redshirt freshman DB Antonio Moore have quit the football team and will transfer to other schools and a fourth backup redshirt freshman FB Jason Barron will miss the season for academic reasons Barron said he will work to improve his grades and return to the team but I would be surprised if he comes back because he is far down on the fullback chart and the Longhorns probably will sign at least players in February With players on scholarship and only seniors they will need to have some more players leave next year to stay within the NCAAs scholarship limit None of the departures came as a surprise and Turner was the only one of the quartet who would have seen any meaningful action this season if he had stayed Joyner was on suspension He was the last to leave of the four players who were suspended prior to the Cotton Bowl game Brown wished all of the young men well and gave the three who are transferring unconditional releases Eric

Longview another star in the outstanding class of offensive line recruits in the state this year came to Texas Saturday with his parents and committed to the Longhorns He is Texas th commitment and that group includes seven offensive linemen Young who already is a full qualifier with a SAT and ACT score said he also had scholarship offers from Miami UCLA Notre Dame Arkansas Texas AM LSU Mississippi State and several other schools But he said he has been a Texas fan for some time and decided to commit when he was offered a scholarship by Coach Mack Brown Saturday He said he met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nunez Drake recruits the Longview area and Nunez is the offensive line coach When asked what he feels his strong points are as an offensive lineman Young said he has worked hard to get quicker and feels he has a quick initial charge He said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he makes quick contact and holds his blocks I really like Texas he said They have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some great things in the next few years and I want to be part of it Longview coach Pat Collins who coached an NCAA Division II national title team at Northeast Louisiana a few years ago has seen some top football players and he says Young is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or coached He has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility and agility Hes a great prospect and a great kid who has really supportive parents For those of you who are disturbed by Youngs time dont worry about it He has a very quick start for such a big man and was adept at picking off speed rushers from his offensive tackle spot as a junior Collins told me he is moving Young to guard because he is a really physical blocker and I want to us to be able to run inside better He can help the team more at guard but he could play guard or tackle in college The states top QB prospect Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch was scheduled to go to Texas AM this weekend for an unofficial visit with his coach Gary Oliver a former Aggie receiver But I talked to Nordgren today Sunday and he told he didnt get to go to AM because Oliver wasnt able to go He said he planned to take a quick trip to Colorado but I didnt go to either place I dont think Im going to be able to go to Colorado now because coach Oliver and I probably will go to AM next weekend and then well be starting twoadays Asked if he is getting close to a decision Nordgren said I really like Texas and I dont think that is going to change I dont think anyone is going to beat Texas I will be very surprised if he doesnt commit to Texas immediately after returning from his AM visit Texas early commitments include seven offensive

am and pm on Tuesday at Frank Denius Fields at th and Red River Ill publish official heights and weights on the freshmen when UT weighs and measures them in the next few days The reason only freshmen reported Monday was that DT Stevie Lee and DB Phillip Geiggar both enrolled in January and went through spring training and DTs Sonny Davis and Marcel Moses failed to qualify academically and are going to junior colleges Two walkons also showed up with the freshmen To show up early walkons have to receive invitations because most walkons dont start practicing until school starts The walkons both defensive backs are Chad Davis of Dallas Skyline and Justin McMinn of Waco Midway McMinn was a firstteam Class A AllState performer last season Brown said Nathan Vasher of Texarkana wants to play in the defensive backfield and Tony Jeffery of Houston Klein Forest wants to play wide receiver and he said both will get their wishes Brown said Roy Williams of Odessa Permian B J Johnson of South Grand Prairie Sloan Thomas of Klein and Jeffery will all be wide receivers and he said all four will be given hurryup instructions to try to get them ready to play early because the Longhorns have no returning regulars at wide receiver Vasher an exceptional athlete who was a rare twoway firsttime AllState performer last year could work his way into the Longhorns dime package six defensive backs during the season because he has the speed meters to go along with good height at about or that the coaches like in their cornerbacks Brown said bumpandrun coverage is something the receivers and cornerbacks will have to work on to earn playing time If a wide receiver cant separate from the defensive back hes not going to play Brown said He told me earlier this year that the thing that makes Florida State so good every year is they can play bump and run on defense and they can beat bump and run on offense He said the wide receivers the Longhorns recruited this year can go a long ways toward beating bumpandrun coverage Several people have asked about the status of C Marcel Blanchard He received a medical hardship scholarship because of chronic shoulder problem and is no longer playing football The Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Buffaloes made a big impression on the states top QB prospect Friday and Saturday Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch flew to Colorado Friday with his father and came home late Saturday He had told me he probably would commit to Texas right after he returned from Colorado but now he says he wants to wait and take a few official visits and probably wont announce his choice until midOctober Boulder is really a beautiful city he said The coaches at Colorado are really impressive They have the program on the right track and they are enlarging their stadium He said Colorado and Texas are at the top of his list and said he also has offers from Purdue LSU Oklahoma Texas AM Tennessee Iowa Houston Missouri and several other schools This is not a good development for the Horns When a recruit goes from being ready to commit to having a new big two after visiting a second school it is not a good sign I see it as about a proposition now The Longhorns are out front with two outstanding defensive ends from other states and they are in contention for still a third outofstate defensive end The two who list the Horns No are Eric Hall from Clarksville Tennessee and Kaelen Jakes from Valencia California Hall was born in Texas Fort Hood and Jakes lived in Plano for about five years Both are outstanding prospects who are drawing offers from other top schools The one who is considering Texas is Shaun Cody of Los Altos HS in Hacienda Heights California He had an incredible sacks last year He says he plans to visit Texas Texas

players strong checked in on time Wednesday with freshman RB Tyrone Richardson the only absentee Richardson who enrolled in January and went through spring practice said I have some academic issues I need to take care of to return to the team He said he hopes to be back in January Coach Mack Brown said he is excited about the heralded freshman class and about the returning players I am really looking forward to meshing the two groups together he said This is a very exciting time for everyone involved with Texas football Brown said the Longhorns dont deserve their No national ranking heading into the season but he said the team has a chance to improve enough to deserve the high ranking later this year He has cited the loss of all the starters at wide receiver and defensive end as two of the main reasons he thinks the team doesnt deserve a top ranking right now That talented freshmen class includes the best three wide receivers Ive seen in Texas Roy Willliams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the years Ive been doing this plus another outstanding prospect who is a former quarterback Tony Jeffery It also includes Adam Doiron and Kalen Thornton two big quick defensive ends who have a lot of potential Brown said it is rare for true freshmen to be play a major role on a good team before midseason but some of the veteran defensive backs who came out to watch the freshman receivers Tuesday afternoon said they dont think it will take Williams Johnson Thomas and Jeffery that long Starting free safety Greg Brown said They are really good players They are big and they have great speed I think they have a chance to help us a lot Starting cornerback Rod Babers never one to shy away from a challenge said he plans to welcome the rookies by showing them a bigtime hit at the line of scrimmage but he too said he was impressed They are really fast and they all catch the ball pretty good he said They have good height too Until the youngsters start knocking heads with the varsity nothing is certain but the early betting would be on at least two of the young wide receivers to play major roles on the Longhorn team Some of you have asked me to break down the current list of commitments and the prospects for adding more commitments on a positionbyposition basis Its a little to early to do any guessing about future commitments at wide receiver and defensive back because the coaches probably will wait to see a few high school games before deciding which WRs and DBs to go after But heres the way it looks to me at the other spots national top players are underlined QB no commitment Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel the highest rated QBs in their respective states are the two main prospects UT should get one of them RB no commitment Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and Anthony Johnson of Jefferson are the two most likely future Longhorns but Jabari Davis of Tucker Ga and Eric Shelton of Lexington Ky are two superstars who say they plan to visit UT James Buchanon of Sarasota Fla is the only fullback UT is recruiting TE no commitment James Moses of Galena Park North Shore is the only tight end on the UT horizon OL commitments Texas has commitments from Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Jersey Village Matt Garcia of Galena Park Will Allen of Cypress Falls Roman Reeves of Livingston Terrance Young of Longview and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC The Longhorns will sign one or two more if they can get Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville William Winston of Houston Madison or Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill DE no

Harris of Killeen Ellison and Paul Broussard of Blinn JC are the main hopes LB commitment Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison is the only middle backer UT will take Derrick Johnson of Waco Jonathan

offense should be much better this season and he said the defense should be his best since coming to Texas Brown said the players showed up in great shape and have shown a lot of enthusiasm in all of the early practices He also said thd depth offensively and defensively will be better than it has been The offensive line is the main question mark and Brown said flatly The offensive line is much improved There is a lot more cohesiveness Most of the guys were starting for the first time last year and they are much more sure of what they need to do now that they have more experience He said guard Antwan KirkHughes is the most improved offensive linemen but he also said We feel like all five offensive line starters will be quality players The team appears to be thinner at guard than tackle on offense but the coaches have moved backup tackle Robbie Doane to guard That is a sure sign that they like the work of massive true freshman Lionel Garr at offensive tackle They want to have four tackles and four guards With Leonard Davis and Mike Williams starting at tackle and Cory Quye and Garr backing them up and KirkHughes and Derrick Dockery starting at guard and Doane and Tillman Holloway backing them up they get their desired twodeep Broad also said junior squadman Corey Bradford has been looking good at tackle At center starter Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from Beau Baker Brown also has said a lot of true freshmen will play this year If we think they can help us win theyll play he said following a twohour practice session Sunday Morning True freshman WR Roy Williams and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis both in the range had outstanding practices Looking at the freshmen it appears likely that will play They are Garr WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery TE Brock Edwards DEs Adam Doiron and Kalen Thonton DT Stevie Lee CB Nathan Vasher LB Austin Sendlein safety Phillip Geiggar punter Justin Smith and kicker Matt McFadden Brown has said he wants to use the two kickers at least in backup roles so they will have a little experience when they take over the two jobs next year TE Bo Scaifes seasonending knee injury has the coaches putting Edwards on the fast track to get him ready to play quickly TE coach Tim Brewster says Edwards is picking up things very quickly Brown said The thing that Bo gave us was great speed down the field Brock Edwards looks pretty fast too and hes ahead of where Bo was last year because of Bos knee Scaife came to Texas after undergoing surgery on his other knee The true freshmen who probably wont play barring a rash of injuries at their positions are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran FB Will Matthews OLs Trey Bates and Jason Glynn and LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas Mock as the third quarterback behind Chris Simms and Major Applewhite will be trained to be ready to play but Brown said he hopes to redshirt him He has been looking very good Beltran and Matthews also look good but the Horns are deep at their positions Brown also has said he hopes to redshirt some offensive linemen and Bates and Glynn are the likely candidates Correction Oh boy when I mess up I mess up

guy I figured the offense could least afford to lose because of his blitzbreaking capabilities tore the ACL in his left knee during the Longhorns first varsity workout Friday morning and he will be out for the season Scaife a surehanded tight end with great speed had surgery on his right knee as a senior in high school He was slowed by that injury last season but regained his speed by the spring and was sensational in spring drills Coach Mack Brown said Scaife will undergo surgery and will miss the entire season The only good news is that he can use this season as a redshirt season since he did play some last season That means he will have three years of eligibility remaining beginning in Now he will have had them both fixed theyll be stronger and maybe he can have three good years Brown said Brown said Mike Jones the starter last season at tight end is a surehanded receiver and outstanding blockers but he said the Horns will miss Scaifes speed He said freshman Brock Edwards who also has speed but not as much as Scaife will get a lot of work starting Saturday to see if he can help take up some of the slack left by Scaifes injury He also said walkon TE Cullen Loeffler has shown some good things and also will get a chance to see if he can contribute This was a major blow to the Texas offense but there is some good news The Longhorns probably have their best secondary since but freshman WR Roy Williams longarmed and fast fast fast treated the starting cornerbacks and safeties like cannon fodder in the morning workout catching two long touchdown passes and tightroping the sideline for two other big catches He dropped only one pass all day and it was when he ran over an obstacle The team worked primarily on putting in some running plays in the afternoon workout so the DBs were spared another dose of Williams in the afternoon All of the heralded freshmen WRs are looking good but Williams is looking sensational I can see why some veteran West Texas football watchers say he is the greatest prospect ever to come out of Odessa Permian There just arent a lot of people his size who can run meters in high jump seven feet and broad jump a state record Even defensive coordinator Carl Reese was impressed by Williams I tell you what he didnt look like a freshman to me Reese said He looked pretty good out there Sloan Thomas B J Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen WRs and they all had their moments Friday Thomas made some acrobatic catches on balls that appeared to be overthrown Johnson and Jeffery a high school QB star who is making the switch to WR both used their quickness to get off the line of scrimmage and make some impressive grabs The Longhorns are loaded at QB with AllBig Major Applewhite battling budding star Chris Simms for the starting job Both looked very sharp throwing long and short Friday but freshman CB Nathan Vasher and backup linebacker O J McClintock picked off two of Simms passes and both might have scored if it had been in a gametype scrimmage Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery appeared to be back to normal He showed as much mobility as he has ever had in rolling right or left and his passes were on target Simms also had a good day except for the two interceptions RECRUITING NOTES Dont be surprised if the official visit for DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn is moved from the scheduled Sept date Hall has a game Friday night Sept and UTs game on Saturday Sept starts at am UT can have a jet plane waiting for Hall after his game and it can fly him to Austin but his parents want to come on his visit to Austin too But NCAA rues dont allow schools to transport parents So the parents would have to fly commercially which means they would either have to leave before his high school game that Friday or come in Saturday in which case they would be too late for the Texas season opener against Louisiana Lafayette The early emphasis in Texas recruiting has been on offensive linemen Look for the late emphasis to be on signing five or six defensive linemen including some big ends who might grow into tackles The True Orange Fax Service includes at least faxes a year and costs by EMail The

Wood possibly the greatest high school coach in Texas history after leading Stamford and Brownwood to multiple state championships before retiring several years ago says Benson is the best running

Subject FW Inside Texas FaxEmail Service Inside Texas Fax Service Vol No Monday Aug Insidetx Inc W Anderson Austin TX for faxes by email Its hard to remember a running back in the state of Texas who has entered his senior season with more incredible publicity than Midland Lees Cedric Benson who committed to Texas Thursday night ending months of sometimes frenzied speculation about his plans and the plans of the Texas coaching staff with regard to him Just as an example hes on the cover of Dave Campbells all by himself a first for a highschooler in the year history of that venerable magazine and hes got high school coaches showering him with praise some calling him the best high school running back theyve ever seen Which is why after talking to him I came away so impressed by his maturity and seeming levelheadedness about the whole thing He answered my questions in a thoughtful and articulate manner and seemed pretty unfazed by the hype This is a young man who cares as much about his performance in the classroom as on the field and he appears to be doing a helluva job in both In short Benson looks like exactly the type of player and person with whom Mack Brown wants to build his program I caught up with Cedric last Saturday afternoon after his Lee team had traveled hours roundtrip by bus to El Paso for a Friday scrimmage So what was it about the Longhorns that made you decide to finally commit to them Benson Theyre doing a great job of recruiting both offensively and defensively Theyve recruited great quarterbacks and receivers so I feel like all they need is a great running back and well be pretty balanced Here at Lee thats how weve been the last couple of years which has enabled us to win state championships and I feel like with a balanced offense nobody will be able to stop us Were you keeping up with the job Texas has been doing recruiting offensive lineman this summer and did that play any role in your decision Benson Yeah definitely Obviously youve been the subject of a huge amount of publicity what with being on the cover of Dave Campbells and having various high school coaches calling you the best high school back theyve ever seen How have you reacted to that Benson I take it as a big compliment when you get coaches at a high level saying that you are a great athlete its just a great compliment but its my job not to let it go to my head Ive still got a lot of work to do here at Lee both schoolwise and footballwise before I go off to school Speaking of Lee back to back state titles thats amazing Do you think youve got a team this season that can make it a threepeat Benson Yeah with a lot of dedication and hard work we can do it again Do you have any personal goals for yourself this season Benson My main goal is just to win and I want to make straight As Ive been thinking about that a lot So you dont get too caught up in the rushing titles and the touchdown records and so forth Benson No because those come along with winning you know If I get out there and work real hard and the team works real hard and we win then I will maybe come out of the game with yards or yards rushing and three or four touchdowns so that just comes along with winning How would you describe your running style what are youre strengths Benson I dont really think I could compare myself to anybody else Im a pretty balanced act I can run my strength is good I can catch and I have good vision Are you featured much out of the backfield at Lee Benson Yeah we do a lot of rollout passes and a lot of screen passes So have the Texas coaches talked to you about how they see you fitting into their offensive scheme Benson No not really and I didnt really question them about it either because Im pretty sure they are focused on what theyve gotta do right now but well talk more about football later What are your physical numbers right now Benson Im probably around right now and about pounds I run a on the track and a on grass So you are done with recruiting and are solid for Texas Benson Yeah I am Im glad to get it all over with and just be a kid again for my last year Finally is there anything youd like to tell the Texas fans out there about yourself as you head into your senior season and beyond that at UT Benson I just want them to know theyll be getting a great guy and a hard football player Pearle Practice notes After a lackluster scrimmage performance Saturday at DKR the Texas offense returned to the field Monday morning with a renewed vigor For probably the first time all fall the offensive players made more noise than their defensive counterparts hooting and hollering after every big offensive play Brett Robin and BJ Johnson provided the biggest screaminducing plays Robin with a barreling draw play run that left Greg Brown flat on his back and Johnson with a catchandrun TD from Major where he outleapt and then outran defender Nathan Vasher After reevaluating the scrimmage and our staff meeting yesterday we felt like that there was more intensity on defense than there was on offense Mack Brown said The offense though came out today and fought back and had some intensity Carl Reese said after practice that he expects Kalen Thornton to see action at RDE in the opener vs LouisianaLafayette The Dcoordinator said hes pleased with the play of Jermain Anderson as the starter at the position but the coaches plan to keep him fresh which Reese says keeps him effective by rotating players in including Cole Pittman and Thornton Speaking of Pittman he saw a lot of work today at LDE because Cory Redding sat out with a sore knee and sore shoulder Brown said Redding would miss Wednesdays final scrimmage and possibly return for Thursdays workout Derrick Dockery has an infected cyst on as Brown put it his rear end and missed Mondays workouts The coach said Dockery is running a fever and is feeling very sick and probably wont be back until next week Tillman Holloway took the firstteam snaps at LG in Dockerys place Ervis Hill did not practice again today because of his sore knee The Texas doctors believe there is not any serious damage to the knee but he will miss the scrimmage Wednesday before possibly returning Thursday Courtnee Garcia hamstring pull participated in pass drills for the first time since last week but still didnt practice full speed Ross ContentType applicationmsword nameFaxprdoc

Service Volume FaxEMail Wednesday August Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Have Final Public Scrimmage Before Huge Crowd Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a short but spirited scrimmage Wednesday night in Royal Memorial Stadium before an enthusiastic crowd UT officials estimated at about With the firstteam defense sitting out most of the scrimmage the offenses dominated most of the way Chris Simms hit of passes for yards including a yard touchdown pass to freshman sensation Roy Williams who had set up the score with a great catch of a yard Simms throw and a yard TD pass to WR Montrell Flowers off a fake reverse The firstteam offense also scored on a twoyard run by TB Victor Ike after starting TB Hodges Mitchell set it up with a yard gallop But QB Major Applewhite led the secondteam offense to two touchdowns hitting of for yards including scoring tosses of yards to the other sensational freshman WR B J Johnson and yards to senior Brandon Healy Applewhites TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and Johnson just ran away from all the pursuit Starting safety Greg Brown intercepted one of Applewhites throws on the secondteams first possession Brown still wouldnt give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the season opener next week but did say both QBs played well Brown also said I was really pleased with the wide receivers I thought they made some steps in running better routes and making the tough catches He also said Ike is clearly the No TB behind Mitchell at this point Redshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring but has not been dominating during the current practices He also has had some nagging injuries Brown said Ike the fastest of the tailbacks has been doing well in practice Victor has been doing the best since hes been here Brown said He is doing much better without the ball blocking than he has in the past Defensive coordinator Carl Reese who has nine starters back says he is feeling better about his new defensive ends Ive got four guys I think can play Reese said Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters and Kaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job He just keeps getting better so hell be the first backup for Anderson and Cole Pittman has had three solid scrimmages in a row so hell be the guy behind Redding I think all four of them will play a lot and theyre the four main ones right now Thornton a true freshman is one of the larger DEs at about but Reese said he is pretty quick out there He gets a good rush from the edge and thats what we like He also is learning to do a better job against the run He said Pittman who was moved over from tackle to provide better run support has been doing a good job against the run and hes a pretty good pass rusher too I think well be okay with those four guys as soon as they get a little more experience Brown said the team will have one more open practice and it will be Thursday at at Denius Field Then he plans to give the team three days off to try to let the players recover from the grueling twoaday workouts The team will go back to work Monday to get ready for the Saturday opener at am against LouisianaLafayette INJURY UPDATE Brown said OT Mike Williams suffered a twisted leg in the scrimmage but he said he didnt think it was serious RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns still have commitments DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn who will take his official visit to Texas the Sept weekend rushed times for yards and completed of passes for yards and two TDs to lead his team to a victory over

over LouisianaLafayette for Saturdays am season opener in Austin For those of you who dont live in Austin and who plan to come to the game this is the hottest summer I have seen in Austin with temperatures hitting and with disturbing regularity so I would advise you to wear something cool and arrange to have plenty of liquids to drink The team returned to practice Monday after getting three days off to recuperate from adays and freshman WR Roy Williams made a spectacular catch of a ball that looked like it was over everyone Coach Mack Brown said he wont name a starting quarterback publicly until the game starts and wont even break the news to Major Applewhite and Chris Simms the two quarterbacks who are competing for the starting job until Saturday morning We want to watch them in practice all week Brown said He also said both QBs are working hard and competing for the starting job We have told our team we have two starters Brown said We are just happy they are both really good In making these decisions we will try to take care of both of them and do what is best for the team All of the injured starters who missed some time last week were back at practice Monday but they didnt run with the first team Brown said as of today redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway would start at left guard because Derrick Dockery missed most of last week sophomore Cole Pittman would start ahead of Cory Redding at DE because Redding was injured last week and Roderick Babers who is locked in a battle with Ervis Hill at CB would get the nod because Hill missed some workouts with an injury But the game isnt today and Brown said the players who were hurt will have an opportunity this week to regain their starting jobs Brown also said he hasnt decided whether to start any true freshmen and said he probably wont make a final decision on that until close to game time too because sometimes you tell a freshman he is going to start and he starts hyperventilating Whether or not they start freshman WRs Williams and B J Johnson will play early and often They are the most impressive freshmen wide receivers I have seen at Texas Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney were a very good pair but Williams and Johnson look better and Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery the other two freshmen WRs arent too far behind Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also says freshman CB Nathan Vasher and freshman DE Kalen Thornton will play Saturday RECRUITING NOTES Greg Barnum the center from Killeen Ellison who left Tennesse and considered transferring to Texas enrolled at Stephen F Austin and says he plans to stay there for the remainder of his career DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn says he is still planning to take his official visit to Texas this weekend and super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison heads the list of high school stars who plan to come to the UT game on unofficial visits Shreveport Evangels game winning streak ended Saturday when Marrero Shaw took a victory Evangel QB Brett Rawls completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns in a losing effort Rawls and Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch are UTs top QB targets this recruiting season BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorn women got a commitment Monday from the states top prospect Heather Schrieber a forward from Windthrost a small town near Wichita Falls Schrieber who had offers from top schools all over the country after a great summer season in AAU ball had narrowed her choices to Texas and Iowa State and she visited the Cyclones last weekend then came home and called the Texas coaches to say she wants to play for the Longhorns I just really like Texas she said Joel Nelson of Flower Mound who coached her in AAU play this summer said Heather is a great player She can bring the ball down court she hit of her threepointers for us and she was the best player on an AAU team that finished fourth in the country She could play guard forward or center at the college level and be very good at any of those positions I know teams like Texas Tech Arkansas Iowa State and several others wanted her too I think shes the best player in the state He said she averaged points rebounds and assists in a game AAU

put the Longhorns through a tough minute practice Wednesday in the teams final fullscale workout before Saturdays am opening game with LouisianaLafayette in Royal Memorial Stadium In answer to a question he said We are not likely to start a true freshman but several of them will get into the game pretty quickly WRs Roy Williams and B J Johnson DE Kalen Thornton DT Stevie Lee and CB Nathan Vasher are the freshmen who are most likely to see quick action Brown said redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway probably will start at left guard but he said Derrick Dockery who had been starting before missing some practice because of a large cyst will play a lot too Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said sophomore DE Cole Pittman has been playing really well If he keeps playing like he has well probably move him over to the other end as the starter and have Jermain Anderson be a swing guy who can substitute at either end Pittman has been backing up Cory Redding at right end He might start at right end Saturday because Redding also has missed some practice with a knee sprain But Reese said Redding and Pittman are my two best ends right now so I might move Pittman Im still not happy with the end play but well keep working on it Texas has nine defensive starters back but the two regulars who graduated were DEs Aaron Hmphrey and Cedric Woodard Brown said he is pleased with the team leadership on defense and he said the offense seems to be developing more leadership He also said he is pleased with the way the team has worked in the record heat in Austin on Monday and on Tuesday the two hottest days on record They have worked really hard he said Weve cut some of the workouts a little short because of the heat but they are in fine shape It was a little cooler in Austin Wednesday with the high around and it is supposed to be in the midtolow s at kickoff time Saturday Brown also said the team is healthy with TE Bo Scaife and WR Jamel Thompson the only players expected to miss the game Scaife is out for the season after undergoing knee surgery in late August and Thompson will miss most or all of the season after undergoing knee surgery following spring practice Brown wont name his QB He says he doesnt even know yet Most observers think it will be Chris Simms but I think its between Simms and Major Applewhite RECRUITING NOTES Im going to Houston Friday to see Galena Park North Shores game with Alief Hastings North Shore has the states top TE James Moses and one of the top LBs Jonathan Jackson Both are strongly considering Texas I usually go to half of one game and then go to half of another game but with that am UT kickoff Saturday morning Ill probably just watch half of that game then head back to Austin I saw North Shore play last year but I want to see how Moses and Jackson look as seniors Ill report on it in my next newsletter The states top safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple wont get much sleep Friday night either His team is going to Brownwood for a game Friday night Hes going to get home about or oclock in the morning then says he will get up in time to make it to Austin to the Texas game I want to see the Longhorns play he said Asked what

Orange FaxEMail Service Volume FaxEMail Tuesday September Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Simms Working as First Team QB Horns Get Pledge from Tyler DB Sophomore QB Chris Simms worked with the first team during Tuesdays practice and if past practices mean anything that is a pretty good sign that he will start Saturday night against Houston Simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the start Junior Major Applewhite worked with the first team prior to the Stanford game and he got the start Coach Mack Brown wont say who will start at quarterback but it doesnt make a lot of sense to have your starting QB working with the second team so it looks like Simms will get his second start Saturday Simms is more mobile than Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery and he also led the Horns to their first touchdown Saturday at Stanford despite only getting snaps to Applewhites Applewhite led the Longhorns to their other two touchdowns but they were both in the fourth quarter Brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the Texas fans who are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk shows are hurt Thats the way we feel too Our players are hurt and our coaches are hurt None of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times But he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense rolling again and shore up the punting team after Stanford scored a touchdown on a blocked punt Brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its punter up shorter than usual Hes yards back just like every other team in the country and we try to get the punt off in seconds or less He got the one that was blocked off in seconds but a kid who blocked it perfectly on the other punts let his guy come through untouched and it got blocked The Longhorns may have some other punts blocked but my sources tell me Brown chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make that same mistake again Folks I guarantee you Brown his assistants and his players are more upset than any of you over the happenings at Palo Alto and they are working hard this week to correct things Remember the guy the stadium was named after was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in years at Texas Bobby Bowden is a pretty good coach too and his perfect season at Florida State last year was his first one TB Hodges Mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against Stanford and the coaches have corrected that Brown also said backup TB Victor Ike will play more Saturday than he has been playing and he said redshirt freshman Kenny Hayter also might see considerable action Were going to play as many as it takes Brown said We have to get our running game going better He also said LG Derrick Dockery might be able to return to fulltime duty Saturday He has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized for an infected cyst That would help us a lot he said Derrick is one of our top offensive linemen Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson will start at strong safety Saturday in place of Lee Jackson who has a pulled hamstring and will miss the Houston game Reese said Pearson has a lot of talent but he said Jacksons experience will be missed Reese also said he will look at freshman Nathan Vasher and juniors Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill to replace Pearson in the Longhorns nickel and dime packages He said the team will play with five and six defensive backs a lot Saturday because Houston will throw it about times ANOTHER RECRUIT COMMITS Texas has commitments now after getting a pledge from Tyler CB Aaron Ross Ross had offers from Alabama Arkansas Baylor LSU Oklahoma Texas AM and others but said he committed to Texas because Ive always been a Longhorrn fan and I really like the Texas coaches He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who recruited him and he said Withers the Texas secondary coach came to see him play in his second game this season He is a big fast corner with long arms but dont look for him to get many interceptions this year because he hasnt had a pass thrown in his direction all year because he is so good at tight manforman coverage My next fax will be

Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Bound for Holiday Bowl to Face Oregon or Oregon State The Longhorns accepted a bid Wednesday to play in the Friday Dec Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego and their opponent will be either Oregon or Oregon State Both Oregon teams shared the Pac title with Washington which is playing Purdue in the Rose Bowl Oregon State will be the Longhorns opponent unless the Beavers get a berth in one of the BCS bowls probably the Fiesta If OSU gets a Fiesta bid then Texas would play Oregon The Holiday Bowl kickoff will be at pm Texas time Longhorn fans can purchase tickets by calling the UT Ticket Office at BEVO or local fans can call If anyone wants to buy tickets in person the ticket office is located on the first floor in Bellmont Hall Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns are excited about accepting this invitation and he said they are also excited about playing either of the Oregon teams because both are ranked in the top Brown also said the game should help Texas recruiting efforts in California and throughout the Pac area because of its location and he also said it should help recruiting nationally because it is a nationally televised ESPN game that does not compete with any other game that evening Brown said the Longhorns will resume practice on Dec but he said some of the coaches will work with some of the players next week Most of the coaches are on the road recruiting this week and many of them will be out again next week Recruiting is our top priority right now Brown said Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said QB Major Applewhite should be close to by Dec but neither he nor Brown would indicate whether Applewhite will get his starting job back or if the nod will go to sophomore Chris Simms who was sensational in leading the Longhorns to a win over archrival Texas AM last Friday My crystal ball tells me it will be Simms because a he had a great game in his last outing and b he is completely healthy while there will be some questions about Applewhites sore knee until he actually takes a lick on it I also think the coaches would feel more comfortable with the idea of Applewhite relieving Simms if Simms had problems than they would be with Simms handling the pinchhitting role FOOTBALL NOTES Brown said he will use the bowl practices to take a closer look at several of the freshman who have been redshirted He said he usually watches them during the season but said so many of the freshmen were playing regularly that the coaches were spending an abnormal amount of time getting them ready which prevented him from seeing as much of the redshirts as he would have liked He said FB Will Matthews and TB Sneezy Beltran are two freshmen he wants to take a good look at to see if they can help the team next year Both Matthews and Beltran have been very impressive on the scout team and Brown is looking for a TB to replace senior Hodges Mitchell and he also wants to give Matthews a shot at competing with FB Matt Trissel FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES The private schools in Texas generally arent the ones who produce top talent for the colleges but two freshmen TE Brock Edwards of Fort Worth Christian and DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St Marks started several games for Texas this year There are some top seniors at the private schools again this year headed by DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas Jesuit There also is a junior QB at Midland Christian who will be hearing from some of the top colleges next year He is Jamie Beeghley He led Midland Christian to the state title last week and hit of passes for yards and ran for more yards in the championship game victory over Fort Worth Christian This year was the year of the offensive linemen which was great for the Longhorns because they needed to sign five or six really good ones and they already have been assured of filling that need Next year probably will be the year of the defensive linemen and that is very good for Texas because the Horns need to sign a bunch of them Ive already seen four or five who would be top recruits this year if they were seniors I mentioned several of them in my last emailfax and Ill write more about them

that he signed following the season He will have eight years remaining on the million per year contract Mack has done a terrific job for The University of Texas our Athletics Department and the football program Dodds said We are extremely proud of everything he his staff and the studentathletes have accomplished and are excited about our future It is very important that the head football coach at Texas remains in the upper echelon of coaching compensation which is an everchanging dynamic Dodds said This raise is in response to the current demand in the coaching marketplace and a welldeserved reward for Macks hard work and dedication We are thrilled with the direction he has taken our football program and look forward to a longlasting relationship Brown has led the Horns to three straight ninewin seasons for the first time since and is guiding UT to a thirdstraight bowl game for just the second time since The No Longhorns will face the No Oregon Ducks at the Culligan

coaches also are in line for raises Football raises about million of the entire million budget for all the mens and womens athletic programs It is the only program that shows a profit Baseball and mens and womens basketball are the only other major revenue sports and none of them produce as much revenue as they spend FOOTBALL NOTES Longhorn ticket sales are lagging for the Holiday Bowl are lagging and Oregon fans are snapping up some of the tickets that were allotted to Texas fans If Longhorn fans dont step up quickly Oregon fans are going to occupy the vast majority of the seats in San Diego on Dec The Longhorns begin practicing for the bowl game Thursday All the practices will be closed to the public Former Longhorn and pro football great Harley Sewell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this week Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis who missed most of this season with a sore shin will get a look at TE in spring practice With the emergence of freshman receivers Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas the pound Ellis might have a better chance of seeing meaningful playing time by beefing up a little and playing tight end Another spring move that is being contemplated is seeing if sophomore LG Derrick Dockery could move over to LT to replace departing senior Leonard Davis Texas has three good guards in Dockery Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway Mike Williams is the only returning tackle who has seen a lot of action In addition to getting the best five linemen on the field at the same time that move might give the offensive line more fire because Holloway is a very aggressive lineman The offensive line has frequently been cited as lacking fire and leadership FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns are having their annual football banq uet this weekend Most of the players making official visits will be players who already are committed to Texas but there are at least two exceptions OL William Winston of Houston Madison and S Rufus Harris of La Porte are both scheduled to visit Super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco now says he is going to take all of his visits in January Texas leads for Winston and Johnson and it it a UTAM battle

qualifying score Davis said he will be in a Longhorn uniform this fall If he doesnt well thats why he signed a letter of intent with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College a Mississippi junior college Thats my backup plan Davis said I dont know yet what I am going to do Davis has enough core courses to qualify and just needs a qualifying test score Greg Barnum the Killeen Ellison center who was being touted as an AllAmerica prospect at Tennessee this season before quitting the team says he probably will enroll at Texas or Stephen F Austin in September to continue his football career Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release Barnum to Texas but has said he will release him to Stephen F Austin Without a release Barnum would have to pay his own way for a year if he enrolls at Texas Id like to see somebody challenge a coachs right to refuse to release a kid Scholarships are renewable now on a yeartoyear basis so Fulmer or any other coach can get rid of a player by simply refusing to renew his scholarship If a school can fire a player then its only fair that a player be able to fire the school I know its an NCAA rule but there is a thing called the U S Constitution that takes precedence over NCAA rules Texas has two great DTs in AllAmerica Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers but there is one at Blinn JC who might be just as good He is Paul Broussard formerly of La Porte which is Shaun Rogers home town too Broussard was a great DT as a sophomore at La Porte when he weighed about but he ballooned up to well over pounds as a junior and senior and was not as dominating He is about and was back in the pound range last year as a freshman at Blinn and he was outstanding Hes working in Austin this summer If his academics are in order lets hope Alfio Randall the big OT at Blinn who plans to enroll at UT next January can talk Broussard into coming along with him RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns have apparently stepped up their recruiting of running backs In addition to offering Anthony Johnson of Jefferson last week the UT coaches are now actively recruiting Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who is on the cover of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazine and Jabari Davis of Tucker Ga Six Longhorn recruits were scheduled to play in the AllStar game in California Saturday night but WR B J Johnson of South Grand Prairie is nursing a sprained ankle and had to withdraw In addition to Sonny Davis the other future Longhorns are WRs Roy Williams of Odessa Permian and Sloan Thomas of Klein DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St Marks and center Jason Glynn of Richardson Berkner That game is supposed to kick off at about pm Texas time and is supposed to be televised by Fox in most areas of Texas FOOTBALL NOTES Another internet rumor that has no substance but has great interest for Longhorns and Red Raiders is the one that has former Tech coach Spike Dykes going to work for Texas Since Spike is still under contract with the Red Raiders it would cost him well into six figures to go to work for the Longhorns It might happen down the road but not anytime soon I normally dont comment on internet rumors but I have had so many queries about Sonny Davis and Spike Dykes that I just decided to give the facts to all of you Sophomore DE Adam McConathy who weighed about last season is up to pounds and hasnt lost any of his speed He is battling Jermain Anderson and Maurice Gordon for the starting job at right end All three are outstanding pass rushers and the coaches want them to get a little bigger so they can do a better job against the run If Sonny Davis does wind up going to a junior college freshman Stevie Lee and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs will back up Hampton and Rogers at DT this year and they will be the guys to beat for the starting jobs in Barring an injury I dont think anyone will beat out Stevie Lee My next fax will be whenever events warrant The True Orange Fax Service includes at least faxes a year and costs by

committed to the Longhorns Wednesday Johnson a hardhitting safety who had tackles last season for the Trojans who had one of the top defenses in the DallasFort Worth area is moving to quarterback this season His father David told me his son decided to commit to the Longhorns because the Texas coaches really impressed him with their coaching methods and with the classy way they operate They were very open and very straightforward David Johnson said his son also attended a TCU camp this summer and went to a Texas AM camp last summer He said several schools called his son in May the month the NCAA allows schools to make one phone call to each recruit He said calls came from coaches at Notre Dame Oklahoma Nebraska Arkansas TCU and others but he said his son decided to commit to Texas and get the recruiting process behind him so he could concentrate on his senior season Braden Johnson has strong athletic blood lines David Johnson was on a football scholarship at Oklahoma State when he suffered a careerending shoulder injury and David has two famous uncles for oldtime football fans One is Bill Johnson who had a year career as a player and coach with the San Francisco ers and who also coached with Paul Brown on the Cleveland Browns staff The other is Gil Johnson the quarterback on the great SMU teams that featured Doak Walker and Kyle Rote Braden Johnson is a threesport star He plays centerfield in baseball and runs on the meter relay in track He also is a good student Johnson is the fifth high school star to commit to Texas this month The others are WRDB Brian Carter of

to graduate from Blinn JC in December and he told me he will enroll at Texas in January All five of the high school prospects who committed did so after attending one of the Longhorns summer camps Scott and Robinson are on virtually all of the national top lists RECRUITING NOTES The top running back and the top quarterback in Texas both say they would like to commit early and the Longhorns are in strong contention for both The RB is Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who rushed for yards and touchdowns in leading Lee to a season and its second straight Class A state championships Both those incredible totals are Class A records The QB is Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch who threw for yards as a sophomore before suffering a broken collarbone last season that knocked him out of his teams final five games He still passed for yards The Longhorns already have commitments from two of the members of the Super Team in Dave Campbells Texas Football Magazine They are Scott and Robinson The only other member of the Super Team who has committed is Madisonville RB David Underwood the Aggies No RB target who announced last week that he is going to be a Michigan Wolverine Allen made the second team and Carter made the third team There are at least five super players I have seen who will be big recruiting targets next year Thats right they were so good as sophomores that every school in the country already knows about them They are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village DL Marco Martin of Mesquite DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and TEOL Eric Winston of Midland Lee Young ran for yards last year in a tough district Young threw for yards and ran for more as a sophomore also in a tough league Martin is so agile that he also plays fullback and so quick that hes a terrific pass rusher and run stopper Leitko was a dominating force as a sophomore last year on The Woodlands playoff team Winston is a great athlete who was one of the stars on Lees title team as a sophomore Leitko and Young came to Texas summer camp earlier this month In the didyouknow department Nebraska was in the last seven football seasons That makes the

Texas AM several weeks ago switched his pledge to Texas Monday and his coach Mike Coker said the switch is final Its a done deal Coker said Coker said Garcia and his mother visited the Texas campus last week on an unofficial visit and met with some of the Texas coaches Hes a little embarrassed about the whole situation Coker said but he said he felt it was something he had to do Coker said he discussed the situation with coaches at Texas and AM before announcing Garcias change of heart Garcia was the highest rated of the Aggies three early commitments Coker said Garcia felt very comfortable with Mack Brown his staff and the atmosphere at the University of Texas Garcia is the seventh high school player to commit to Texas this month In addition Alfio Randall a star OT at Blinn JC says he will come to Texas in January after he graduates from Blinn The other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands Scott and Robinson are on all of the early national top recruiting lists With six top offensive linemen already committed counting Randall the Longhorns are on the way to signing an awesome group to fill their greatest need in this recruiting class Top offensive and defensive linemen have been in short supply in Texas since Brown arrived but this years offensive line class is very deep in talented players The Longhorns are still in strong contention for two other top offensive linemen Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison Hightower drove to Nebraska for an unofficial weekend visit and after the hour return trip said today he had a great time and said Nebraska Texas and AM are his big three Winston also likes AM and Texas but is considering several outofstate schools BARNUM UPDATE Greg Barnum the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year took a tour of the Texas campus last week and he liked what he saw Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release so far which would force him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand But Barnums attorney has written a letter to Tennessee officials demanding a release NCAA rules require colleges and their recruits to honor the letter of intent recruits sign for one year But the rules give the college coach a big advantage after the first year in that he can refuse to renew the scholarship or as in Barnums case refuse to allow the kid to get an immediate scholarship at another school The NCAA has some rules that probably violate the U S Constitution and this would seem to be one of them Back when colleges gave kids fouryear scholarships it might have been fair to give coaches the right to deny an outright release to unhappy recruits but when the rules were changed to give oneyear scholarships that were renewable every year the coachs power was left unchanged I dont think the NCAA or Tennessee will want to see this come to court so if I was a gambling man I would be willing to bet a fair amount that young Mr Barnum gets his release if he keeps pushing If he comes to Texas he will have to sit out a year then will have three years of eligibility left BASEBALL NOTES The pros are still working to sign several current Longhorns and UT recruits but only three juniors second baseman Tommy Nicholson relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West have signed so far BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville The Longhorns were recruiting him but their primary target for their lone remaining scholarship is still T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge win the Class A state title Ford one of the nations top point guards is strongly considering the Longhorns Texas already has a commitment from center Chris Wright of

almost yards and nearly touchdowns between them last season but Texas does and UT has picked up a commitment from one of them and has a good chance to get a pledge from the other one this weekend QB Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship said he called coach Mack Brown late Tuesday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns Briles led Stephenville to the Class A State Championship last year but moved to the Lubbock area when his father Art Briles who coached Stephenville to three perfect seasons and state titles in the s took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech I called coach Brown last night and told him I was committing Briles said I have always liked Texas They have a great academic reputation and Im excited about playing for the Longhorns Briles was the Class A offensive player of the year and it is easy to understand why when you look at his statistics All he did last year offensively was complete of passes for yards and touchdowns and use his quick feet to run for more yards and more TDs Thats an incredible yards of offense and an equally incredible touchdowns The other half of that prolific duo is RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who ran for a Class A record yards and another record touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State Championship Benson is flying to Austin Saturday with his mother to meet with the UT coaches He is a longtime UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college this summer so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season I asked him if he will commit to Texas this weekend He replied Maybe Well see Benson also told me he runs a consistent on grass and has run a on a track When you add their junior statistics it comes out to yards and touchdowns I dont think there have ever been two players in the Texas high school ranks even in sixman footballs where yardage and touchdowns are the name of the game who have ever had offensive totals like that in a single season Class A and Class A include the largest schools in Texas and seasons like they had as juniors never happen in those classifications Benson rushed for more than yards his sophomore year in Lees championship season and led the Rebels to a perfect season in Briles who became the Longhorns th early commitment turned down an offer to be an option quarterback at Nebraska to be a safety at Texas He attended summer camps at both schools before selecting the Longhorns It was a wise choice if he wants a chance to play in the NFL There are some starting defensive backs in the NFL but there are no starting quarterbacks The Longhorns other commitments include MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park who switched from AM to Texas Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands QB Quon Cosby of Mart is

a scholarship and told him they want him to be a cornerback and kick returner In leading Mart to the Class A state title last year Cosby passed for yards and TDs ran for yards and scores and had nine

for the next two years Beltran is a good student who almost qualified on his first try at the ACT but he said he operates best under pressure and he proved it by waiting until the last possible date to take it again He is a full qualifier now and gives the Longhorns incoming scholarship recruits Texas actually has freshmen who have never redshirted on scholarship but three of them DT Stevie Lee and S Phillip Geiggar both of Shreveport Evangel and FB Tyrone Richardson of Clarksville enrolled last January so only scholarship freshmen will be reporting next month for the first time In addition to Davis the Longhorns lost DT Marcel Moses of Texas City to Kilgore JC Both Davis and Moses say they plan to come back to UT in two years after they graduate from junior college Lee looked like a future star in spring training but Texas really needs to sign some more defensive tackles because AllAmerican Casey Hampton and AllBig Shaun Rogers are both heading into their senior seasons The defensive tackle position in the Texas high school ranks is a true good news bad news story this year The good news is that Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is as good a DT prospect as there is in the country and he is a strong Texas lean The bad news is that there is no one else even close to him in the entire state So if the Horns get Harris they will have snared a great DT but if they dont they sure will need to get one who can play as a true freshman the following year RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who ran for a Class A record yards and another record touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State Championship had to cancel his unofficial visit to Texas last weekend He and his mother had planned to fly to Austin Saturday but they were flying standby and got

Kendrick Turner sophomore LB Jamal Joyner and redshirt freshman DB Antonio Moore have quit the football team and will transfer to other schools and a fourth backup redshirt freshman FB Jason Barron will miss the season for academic reasons Barron said he will work to improve his grades and return to the team but I would be surprised if he comes back because he is far down on the fullback chart and the Longhorns probably will sign at least players in February With players on scholarship and only seniors they will need to have some more players leave next year to stay within the NCAAs scholarship limit None of the departures came as a surprise and Turner was the only one of the quartet who would have seen any meaningful action this season if he had stayed Joyner was on suspension He was the last to leave of the four players who were suspended prior to the Cotton Bowl game Brown wished all of the young men well and gave the three who are transferring unconditional releases Eric

Longview another star in the outstanding class of offensive line recruits in the state this year came to Texas Saturday with his parents and committed to the Longhorns He is Texas th commitment and that group includes seven offensive linemen Young who already is a full qualifier with a SAT and ACT score said he also had scholarship offers from Miami UCLA Notre Dame Arkansas Texas AM LSU Mississippi State and several other schools But he said he has been a Texas fan for some time and decided to commit when he was offered a scholarship by Coach Mack Brown Saturday He said he met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nunez Drake recruits the Longview area and Nunez is the offensive line coach When asked what he feels his strong points are as an offensive lineman Young said he has worked hard to get quicker and feels he has a quick initial charge He said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he makes quick contact and holds his blocks I really like Texas he said They have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some great things in the next few years and I want to be part of it Longview coach Pat Collins who coached an NCAA Division II national title team at Northeast Louisiana a few years ago has seen some top football players and he says Young is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or coached He has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility and agility Hes a great prospect and a great kid who has really supportive parents For those of you who are disturbed by Youngs time dont worry about it He has a very quick start for such a big man and was adept at picking off speed rushers from his offensive tackle spot as a junior Collins told me he is moving Young to guard because he is a really physical blocker and I want to us to be able to run inside better He can help the team more at guard but he could play guard or tackle in college The states top QB prospect Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch was scheduled to go to Texas AM this weekend for an unofficial visit with his coach Gary Oliver a former Aggie receiver But I talked to Nordgren today Sunday and he told he didnt get to go to AM because Oliver wasnt able to go He said he planned to take a quick trip to Colorado but I didnt go to either place I dont think Im going to be able to go to Colorado now because coach Oliver and I probably will go to AM next weekend and then well be starting twoadays Asked if he is getting close to a decision Nordgren said I really like Texas and I dont think that is going to change I dont think anyone is going to beat Texas I will be very surprised if he doesnt commit to Texas immediately after returning from his AM visit Texas early commitments include seven offensive

am and pm on Tuesday at Frank Denius Fields at th and Red River Ill publish official heights and weights on the freshmen when UT weighs and measures them in the next few days The reason only freshmen reported Monday was that DT Stevie Lee and DB Phillip Geiggar both enrolled in January and went through spring training and DTs Sonny Davis and Marcel Moses failed to qualify academically and are going to junior colleges Two walkons also showed up with the freshmen To show up early walkons have to receive invitations because most walkons dont start practicing until school starts The walkons both defensive backs are Chad Davis of Dallas Skyline and Justin McMinn of Waco Midway McMinn was a firstteam Class A AllState performer last season Brown said Nathan Vasher of Texarkana wants to play in the defensive backfield and Tony Jeffery of Houston Klein Forest wants to play wide receiver and he said both will get their wishes Brown said Roy Williams of Odessa Permian B J Johnson of South Grand Prairie Sloan Thomas of Klein and Jeffery will all be wide receivers and he said all four will be given hurryup instructions to try to get them ready to play early because the Longhorns have no returning regulars at wide receiver Vasher an exceptional athlete who was a rare twoway firsttime AllState performer last year could work his way into the Longhorns dime package six defensive backs during the season because he has the speed meters to go along with good height at about or that the coaches like in their cornerbacks Brown said bumpandrun coverage is something the receivers and cornerbacks will have to work on to earn playing time If a wide receiver cant separate from the defensive back hes not going to play Brown said He told me earlier this year that the thing that makes Florida State so good every year is they can play bump and run on defense and they can beat bump and run on offense He said the wide receivers the Longhorns recruited this year can go a long ways toward beating bumpandrun coverage Several people have asked about the status of C Marcel Blanchard He received a medical hardship scholarship because of chronic shoulder problem and is no longer playing football The Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Buffaloes made a big impression on the states top QB prospect Friday and Saturday Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch flew to Colorado Friday with his father and came home late Saturday He had told me he probably would commit to Texas right after he returned from Colorado but now he says he wants to wait and take a few official visits and probably wont announce his choice until midOctober Boulder is really a beautiful city he said The coaches at Colorado are really impressive They have the program on the right track and they are enlarging their stadium He said Colorado and Texas are at the top of his list and said he also has offers from Purdue LSU Oklahoma Texas AM Tennessee Iowa Houston Missouri and several other schools This is not a good development for the Horns When a recruit goes from being ready to commit to having a new big two after visiting a second school it is not a good sign I see it as about a proposition now The Longhorns are out front with two outstanding defensive ends from other states and they are in contention for still a third outofstate defensive end The two who list the Horns No are Eric Hall from Clarksville Tennessee and Kaelen Jakes from Valencia California Hall was born in Texas Fort Hood and Jakes lived in Plano for about five years Both are outstanding prospects who are drawing offers from other top schools The one who is considering Texas is Shaun Cody of Los Altos HS in Hacienda Heights California He had an incredible sacks last year He says he plans to visit Texas Texas

players strong checked in on time Wednesday with freshman RB Tyrone Richardson the only absentee Richardson who enrolled in January and went through spring practice said I have some academic issues I need to take care of to return to the team He said he hopes to be back in January Coach Mack Brown said he is excited about the heralded freshman class and about the returning players I am really looking forward to meshing the two groups together he said This is a very exciting time for everyone involved with Texas football Brown said the Longhorns dont deserve their No national ranking heading into the season but he said the team has a chance to improve enough to deserve the high ranking later this year He has cited the loss of all the starters at wide receiver and defensive end as two of the main reasons he thinks the team doesnt deserve a top ranking right now That talented freshmen class includes the best three wide receivers Ive seen in Texas Roy Willliams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the years Ive been doing this plus another outstanding prospect who is a former quarterback Tony Jeffery It also includes Adam Doiron and Kalen Thornton two big quick defensive ends who have a lot of potential Brown said it is rare for true freshmen to be play a major role on a good team before midseason but some of the veteran defensive backs who came out to watch the freshman receivers Tuesday afternoon said they dont think it will take Williams Johnson Thomas and Jeffery that long Starting free safety Greg Brown said They are really good players They are big and they have great speed I think they have a chance to help us a lot Starting cornerback Rod Babers never one to shy away from a challenge said he plans to welcome the rookies by showing them a bigtime hit at the line of scrimmage but he too said he was impressed They are really fast and they all catch the ball pretty good he said They have good height too Until the youngsters start knocking heads with the varsity nothing is certain but the early betting would be on at least two of the young wide receivers to play major roles on the Longhorn team Some of you have asked me to break down the current list of commitments and the prospects for adding more commitments on a positionbyposition basis Its a little to early to do any guessing about future commitments at wide receiver and defensive back because the coaches probably will wait to see a few high school games before deciding which WRs and DBs to go after But heres the way it looks to me at the other spots national top players are underlined QB no commitment Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel the highest rated QBs in their respective states are the two main prospects UT should get one of them RB no commitment Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and Anthony Johnson of Jefferson are the two most likely future Longhorns but Jabari Davis of Tucker Ga and Eric Shelton of Lexington Ky are two superstars who say they plan to visit UT James Buchanon of Sarasota Fla is the only fullback UT is recruiting TE no commitment James Moses of Galena Park North Shore is the only tight end on the UT horizon OL commitments Texas has commitments from Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Jersey Village Matt Garcia of Galena Park Will Allen of Cypress Falls Roman Reeves of Livingston Terrance Young of Longview and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC The Longhorns will sign one or two more if they can get Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville William Winston of Houston Madison or Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill DE no

Harris of Killeen Ellison and Paul Broussard of Blinn JC are the main hopes LB commitment Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison is the only middle backer UT will take Derrick Johnson of Waco Jonathan

offense should be much better this season and he said the defense should be his best since coming to Texas Brown said the players showed up in great shape and have shown a lot of enthusiasm in all of the early practices He also said thd depth offensively and defensively will be better than it has been The offensive line is the main question mark and Brown said flatly The offensive line is much improved There is a lot more cohesiveness Most of the guys were starting for the first time last year and they are much more sure of what they need to do now that they have more experience He said guard Antwan KirkHughes is the most improved offensive linemen but he also said We feel like all five offensive line starters will be quality players The team appears to be thinner at guard than tackle on offense but the coaches have moved backup tackle Robbie Doane to guard That is a sure sign that they like the work of massive true freshman Lionel Garr at offensive tackle They want to have four tackles and four guards With Leonard Davis and Mike Williams starting at tackle and Cory Quye and Garr backing them up and KirkHughes and Derrick Dockery starting at guard and Doane and Tillman Holloway backing them up they get their desired twodeep Broad also said junior squadman Corey Bradford has been looking good at tackle At center starter Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from Beau Baker Brown also has said a lot of true freshmen will play this year If we think they can help us win theyll play he said following a twohour practice session Sunday Morning True freshman WR Roy Williams and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis both in the range had outstanding practices Looking at the freshmen it appears likely that will play They are Garr WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery TE Brock Edwards DEs Adam Doiron and Kalen Thonton DT Stevie Lee CB Nathan Vasher LB Austin Sendlein safety Phillip Geiggar punter Justin Smith and kicker Matt McFadden Brown has said he wants to use the two kickers at least in backup roles so they will have a little experience when they take over the two jobs next year TE Bo Scaifes seasonending knee injury has the coaches putting Edwards on the fast track to get him ready to play quickly TE coach Tim Brewster says Edwards is picking up things very quickly Brown said The thing that Bo gave us was great speed down the field Brock Edwards looks pretty fast too and hes ahead of where Bo was last year because of Bos knee Scaife came to Texas after undergoing surgery on his other knee The true freshmen who probably wont play barring a rash of injuries at their positions are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran FB Will Matthews OLs Trey Bates and Jason Glynn and LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas Mock as the third quarterback behind Chris Simms and Major Applewhite will be trained to be ready to play but Brown said he hopes to redshirt him He has been looking very good Beltran and Matthews also look good but the Horns are deep at their positions Brown also has said he hopes to redshirt some offensive linemen and Bates and Glynn are the likely candidates Correction Oh boy when I mess up I mess up

guy I figured the offense could least afford to lose because of his blitzbreaking capabilities tore the ACL in his left knee during the Longhorns first varsity workout Friday morning and he will be out for the season Scaife a surehanded tight end with great speed had surgery on his right knee as a senior in high school He was slowed by that injury last season but regained his speed by the spring and was sensational in spring drills Coach Mack Brown said Scaife will undergo surgery and will miss the entire season The only good news is that he can use this season as a redshirt season since he did play some last season That means he will have three years of eligibility remaining beginning in Now he will have had them both fixed theyll be stronger and maybe he can have three good years Brown said Brown said Mike Jones the starter last season at tight end is a surehanded receiver and outstanding blockers but he said the Horns will miss Scaifes speed He said freshman Brock Edwards who also has speed but not as much as Scaife will get a lot of work starting Saturday to see if he can help take up some of the slack left by Scaifes injury He also said walkon TE Cullen Loeffler has shown some good things and also will get a chance to see if he can contribute This was a major blow to the Texas offense but there is some good news The Longhorns probably have their best secondary since but freshman WR Roy Williams longarmed and fast fast fast treated the starting cornerbacks and safeties like cannon fodder in the morning workout catching two long touchdown passes and tightroping the sideline for two other big catches He dropped only one pass all day and it was when he ran over an obstacle The team worked primarily on putting in some running plays in the afternoon workout so the DBs were spared another dose of Williams in the afternoon All of the heralded freshmen WRs are looking good but Williams is looking sensational I can see why some veteran West Texas football watchers say he is the greatest prospect ever to come out of Odessa Permian There just arent a lot of people his size who can run meters in high jump seven feet and broad jump a state record Even defensive coordinator Carl Reese was impressed by Williams I tell you what he didnt look like a freshman to me Reese said He looked pretty good out there Sloan Thomas B J Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen WRs and they all had their moments Friday Thomas made some acrobatic catches on balls that appeared to be overthrown Johnson and Jeffery a high school QB star who is making the switch to WR both used their quickness to get off the line of scrimmage and make some impressive grabs The Longhorns are loaded at QB with AllBig Major Applewhite battling budding star Chris Simms for the starting job Both looked very sharp throwing long and short Friday but freshman CB Nathan Vasher and backup linebacker O J McClintock picked off two of Simms passes and both might have scored if it had been in a gametype scrimmage Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery appeared to be back to normal He showed as much mobility as he has ever had in rolling right or left and his passes were on target Simms also had a good day except for the two interceptions RECRUITING NOTES Dont be surprised if the official visit for DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn is moved from the scheduled Sept date Hall has a game Friday night Sept and UTs game on Saturday Sept starts at am UT can have a jet plane waiting for Hall after his game and it can fly him to Austin but his parents want to come on his visit to Austin too But NCAA rues dont allow schools to transport parents So the parents would have to fly commercially which means they would either have to leave before his high school game that Friday or come in Saturday in which case they would be too late for the Texas season opener against Louisiana Lafayette The early emphasis in Texas recruiting has been on offensive linemen Look for the late emphasis to be on signing five or six defensive linemen including some big ends who might grow into tackles The True Orange Fax Service includes at least faxes a year and costs by EMail The

Benson is the th commitment for the Longhorns this recruiting season and he certainly is the most famous after rushing for yards and touchdowns last season He scored seven other touchdowns on pass receptions for a grand total of TDs No Class A back in Texas has ever accounted for as many yards or touchdowns as Benson did in leading Midland Lee to a state title and an undefeated season in Gordon Wood possibly the greatest high school coach in Texas history after leading Stamford and Brownwood to multiple state championships before retiring several years ago says Benson is the best running back I have ever seen in high school Woods teams had some great backs and they played against some other great backs so that is high praise indeed Benson is on all the national top lists as are fellow Texas pledges Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village both offensive linemen OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC another Texas commitment was a national top prospect two

Box Austin Texas Phone Sonny Davis Awaiting Test Score Barnum Watch Ongoing DT Sonny Davis is amazed by all the internet speculation that he is headed for junior college and he says it isnt necessarily so I havent got my test score back yet he said Tuesday from California where he is training with the Texas AllStar team that will meet the California AllStars Saturday night If he makes a qualifying score Davis said he will be in a Longhorn uniform this fall If he doesnt well thats why he signed a letter of intent with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College a Mississippi junior college Thats my backup plan Davis said I dont know yet what I am going to do Davis has enough core courses to qualify and just needs a qualifying test score Greg Barnum the Killeen Ellison center who was being touted as an AllAmerica prospect at Tennessee this season before quitting the team says he probably will enroll at Texas or Stephen F Austin in September to continue his football career Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release Barnum to Texas but has said he will release him to Stephen F Austin Without a release Barnum would have to pay his own way for a year if he enrolls at Texas Id like to see somebody challenge a coachs right to refuse to release a kid Scholarships are renewable now on a yeartoyear basis so Fulmer or any other coach can get rid of a player by simply refusing to renew his scholarship If a school can fire a player then its only fair that a player be able to fire the school I know its an NCAA rule but there is a thing called the U S Constitution that takes precedence over NCAA rules Texas has two great DTs in AllAmerica Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers but there is one at Blinn JC who might be just as good He is Paul Broussard formerly of La Porte which is Shaun Rogers home town too Broussard was a great DT as a sophomore at La Porte when he weighed about but he ballooned up to well over pounds as a junior and senior and was not as dominating He is about and was back in the pound range last year as a freshman at Blinn and he was outstanding Hes working in Austin this summer If his academics are in order lets hope Alfio Randall the big OT at Blinn who plans to enroll at UT next January can talk Broussard into coming along with him RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns have apparently stepped up their recruiting of running backs In addition to offering Anthony Johnson of Jefferson last week the UT coaches are now actively recruiting Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who is on the cover of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazine and Jabari Davis of Tucker Ga Six Longhorn recruits were scheduled to play in the AllStar game in California Saturday night but WR B J Johnson of South Grand Prairie is nursing a sprained ankle and had to withdraw In addition to Sonny Davis the other future Longhorns are WRs Roy Williams of Odessa Permian and Sloan Thomas of Klein DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St Marks and center Jason Glynn of Richardson Berkner That game is supposed to kick off at about pm Texas time and is supposed to be televised by Fox in most areas of Texas FOOTBALL NOTES Another internet rumor that has no substance but has great interest for Longhorns and Red Raiders is the one that has former Tech coach Spike Dykes going to work for Texas Since Spike is still under contract with the Red Raiders it would cost him well into six figures to go to work for the Longhorns It might happen down the road but not anytime soon I normally dont comment on internet rumors but I have had so many queries about Sonny Davis and Spike Dykes that I just decided to give the facts to all of you Sophomore DE Adam McConathy who weighed about last season is up to pounds and hasnt lost any of his speed He is battling Jermain Anderson and Maurice Gordon for the starting job at right end All three are outstanding pass rushers and the coaches want them to get a little bigger so they can do a better job against the run If Sonny Davis does wind up going to a junior college freshman Stevie Lee and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs will back up Hampton and Rogers at DT this year and they will be the guys to beat for the

committed to the Longhorns Wednesday Johnson a hardhitting safety who had tackles last season for the Trojans who had one of the top defenses in the DallasFort Worth area is moving to quarterback this season His father David told me his son decided to commit to the Longhorns because the Texas coaches really impressed him with their coaching methods and with the classy way they operate They were very open and very straightforward David Johnson said his son also attended a TCU camp this summer and went to a Texas AM camp last summer He said several schools called his son in May the month the NCAA allows schools to make one phone call to each recruit He said calls came from coaches at Notre Dame Oklahoma Nebraska Arkansas TCU and others but he said his son decided to commit to Texas and get the recruiting process behind him so he could concentrate on his senior season Braden Johnson has strong athletic blood lines David Johnson was on a football scholarship at Oklahoma State when he suffered a careerending shoulder injury and David has two famous uncles for oldtime football fans One is Bill Johnson who had a year career as a player and coach with the San Francisco ers and who also coached with Paul Brown on the Cleveland Browns staff The other is Gil Johnson the quarterback on the great SMU teams that featured Doak Walker and Kyle Rote Braden Johnson is a threesport star He plays centerfield in baseball and runs on the meter relay in track He also is a good student Johnson is the fifth high school star to commit to Texas this month The others are WRDB Brian Carter of

to graduate from Blinn JC in December and he told me he will enroll at Texas in January All five of the high school prospects who committed did so after attending one of the Longhorns summer camps Scott and Robinson are on virtually all of the national top lists RECRUITING NOTES The top running back and the top quarterback in Texas both say they would like to commit early and the Longhorns are in strong contention for both The RB is Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who rushed for yards and touchdowns in leading Lee to a season and its second straight Class A state championships Both those incredible totals are Class A records The QB is Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch who threw for yards as a sophomore before suffering a broken collarbone last season that knocked him out of his teams final five games He still passed for yards The Longhorns already have commitments from two of the members of the Super Team in Dave Campbells Texas Football Magazine They are Scott and Robinson The only other member of the Super Team who has committed is Madisonville RB David Underwood the Aggies No RB target who announced last week that he is going to be a Michigan Wolverine Allen made the second team and Carter made the third team There are at least five super players I have seen who will be big recruiting targets next year Thats right they were so good as sophomores that every school in the country already knows about them They are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village DL Marco Martin of Mesquite DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and TEOL Eric Winston of Midland Lee Young ran for yards last year in a tough district Young threw for yards and ran for more as a sophomore also in a tough league Martin is so agile that he also plays fullback and so quick that hes a terrific pass rusher and run stopper Leitko was a dominating force as a sophomore last year on The Woodlands playoff team Winston is a great athlete who was one of the stars on Lees title team as a sophomore Leitko and Young came to Texas summer camp earlier this month In the didyouknow department Nebraska was in the last seven football seasons That makes the

Texas AM several weeks ago switched his pledge to Texas Monday and his coach Mike Coker said the switch is final Its a done deal Coker said Coker said Garcia and his mother visited the Texas campus last week on an unofficial visit and met with some of the Texas coaches Hes a little embarrassed about the whole situation Coker said but he said he felt it was something he had to do Coker said he discussed the situation with coaches at Texas and AM before announcing Garcias change of heart Garcia was the highest rated of the Aggies three early commitments Coker said Garcia felt very comfortable with Mack Brown his staff and the atmosphere at the University of Texas Garcia is the seventh high school player to commit to Texas this month In addition Alfio Randall a star OT at Blinn JC says he will come to Texas in January after he graduates from Blinn The other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands Scott and Robinson are on all of the early national top recruiting lists With six top offensive linemen already committed counting Randall the Longhorns are on the way to signing an awesome group to fill their greatest need in this recruiting class Top offensive and defensive linemen have been in short supply in Texas since Brown arrived but this years offensive line class is very deep in talented players The Longhorns are still in strong contention for two other top offensive linemen Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison Hightower drove to Nebraska for an unofficial weekend visit and after the hour return trip said today he had a great time and said Nebraska Texas and AM are his big three Winston also likes AM and Texas but is considering several outofstate schools BARNUM UPDATE Greg Barnum the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year took a tour of the Texas campus last week and he liked what he saw Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release so far which would force him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand But Barnums attorney has written a letter to Tennessee officials demanding a release NCAA rules require colleges and their recruits to honor the letter of intent recruits sign for one year But the rules give the college coach a big advantage after the first year in that he can refuse to renew the scholarship or as in Barnums case refuse to allow the kid to get an immediate scholarship at another school The NCAA has some rules that probably violate the U S Constitution and this would seem to be one of them Back when colleges gave kids fouryear scholarships it might have been fair to give coaches the right to deny an outright release to unhappy recruits but when the rules were changed to give oneyear scholarships that were renewable every year the coachs power was left unchanged I dont think the NCAA or Tennessee will want to see this come to court so if I was a gambling man I would be willing to bet a fair amount that young Mr Barnum gets his release if he keeps pushing If he comes to Texas he will have to sit out a year then will have three years of eligibility left BASEBALL NOTES The pros are still working to sign several current Longhorns and UT recruits but only three juniors second baseman Tommy Nicholson relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West have signed so far BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville The Longhorns were recruiting him but their primary target for their lone remaining scholarship is still T J

almost yards and nearly touchdowns between them last season but Texas does and UT has picked up a commitment from one of them and has a good chance to get a pledge from the other one this weekend QB Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship said he called coach Mack Brown late Tuesday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns Briles led Stephenville to the Class A State Championship last year but moved to the Lubbock area when his father Art Briles who coached Stephenville to three perfect seasons and state titles in the s took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech I called coach Brown last night and told him I was committing Briles said I have always liked Texas They have a great academic reputation and Im excited about playing for the Longhorns Briles was the Class A offensive player of the year and it is easy to understand why when you look at his statistics All he did last year offensively was complete of passes for yards and touchdowns and use his quick feet to run for more yards and more TDs Thats an incredible yards of offense and an equally incredible touchdowns The other half of that prolific duo is RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who ran for a Class A record yards and another record touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State Championship Benson is flying to Austin Saturday with his mother to meet with the UT coaches He is a longtime UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college this summer so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season I asked him if he will commit to Texas this weekend He replied Maybe Well see Benson also told me he runs a consistent on grass and has run a on a track When you add their junior statistics it comes out to yards and touchdowns I dont think there have ever been two players in the Texas high school ranks even in sixman footballs where yardage and touchdowns are the name of the game who have ever had offensive totals like that in a single season Class A and Class A include the largest schools in Texas and seasons like they had as juniors never happen in those classifications Benson rushed for more than yards his sophomore year in Lees championship season and led the Rebels to a perfect season in Briles who became the Longhorns th early commitment turned down an offer to be an option quarterback at Nebraska to be a safety at Texas He attended summer camps at both schools before selecting the Longhorns It was a wise choice if he wants a chance to play in the NFL There are some starting defensive backs in the NFL but there are no starting quarterbacks The Longhorns other commitments include MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park who switched from AM to Texas Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands QB Quon Cosby of Mart is

a scholarship and told him they want him to be a cornerback and kick returner In leading Mart to the Class A state title last year Cosby passed for yards and TDs ran for yards and scores and had nine kick returns for TDs Thats TDs for this explosive young man who lists Texas No UT junior center Chris Mihm was the No pick in the NBA draft Wednesday by the Chicago Bulls who then swapped him to

to take it again He is a full qualifier now and gives the Longhorns incoming scholarship recruits Texas actually has freshmen who have never redshirted on scholarship but three of them DT Stevie Lee and S Phillip Geiggar both of Shreveport Evangel and FB Tyrone Richardson of Clarksville enrolled last January so only scholarship freshmen will be reporting next month for the first time In addition to Davis the Longhorns lost DT Marcel Moses of Texas City to Kilgore JC Both Davis and Moses say they plan to come back to UT in two years after they graduate from junior college Lee looked like a future star in spring training but Texas really needs to sign some more defensive tackles because AllAmerican Casey Hampton and AllBig Shaun Rogers are both heading into their senior seasons The defensive tackle position in the Texas high school ranks is a true good news bad news story this year The good news is that Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is as good a DT prospect as there is in the country and he is a strong Texas lean The bad news is that there is no one else even close to him in the entire state So if the Horns get Harris they will have snared a great DT but if they dont they sure will need to get one who can play as a true freshman the following year RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee who ran for a Class A record yards and another record touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State Championship had to cancel his unofficial visit to Texas last weekend He and his mother had planned to fly to Austin Saturday but they were flying standby and got

are not as bright as they were earlier He likes Texas but dont believe those internet rumors that he has been accepted by the UT admissions office Barnum was supposed to be the anchor of Tennessees offensive line this season but he quit the team several weeks ago Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release him Under Fulmer the Vols have one of the worst graduation rates in the college ranks

Longview another star in the outstanding class of offensive line recruits in the state this year came to Texas Saturday with his parents and committed to the Longhorns He is Texas th commitment and that group includes seven offensive linemen Young who already is a full qualifier with a SAT and ACT score said he also had scholarship offers from Miami UCLA Notre Dame Arkansas Texas AM LSU Mississippi State and several other schools But he said he has been a Texas fan for some time and decided to commit when he was offered a scholarship by Coach Mack Brown Saturday He said he met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nunez Drake recruits the Longview area and Nunez is the offensive line coach When asked what he feels his strong points are as an offensive lineman Young said he has worked hard to get quicker and feels he has a quick initial charge He said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he makes quick contact and holds his blocks I really like Texas he said They have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some great things in the next few years and I want to be part of it Longview coach Pat Collins who coached an NCAA Division II national title team at Northeast Louisiana a few years ago has seen some top football players and he says Young is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or coached He has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility and agility Hes a great prospect and a great kid who has really supportive parents For those of you who are disturbed by Youngs time dont worry about it He has a very quick start for such a big man and was adept at picking off speed rushers from his offensive tackle spot as a junior Collins told me he is moving Young to guard because he is a really physical blocker and I want to us to be able to run inside better He can help the team more at guard but he could play guard or tackle in college The states top QB prospect Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch was scheduled to go to Texas AM this weekend for an unofficial visit with his coach Gary Oliver a former Aggie receiver But I talked to Nordgren today Sunday and he told he didnt get to go to AM because Oliver wasnt able to go He said he planned to take a quick trip to Colorado but I didnt go to either place I dont think Im going to be able to go to Colorado now because coach Oliver and I probably will go to AM next weekend and then well be starting twoadays Asked if he is getting close to a decision Nordgren said I really like Texas and I dont think that is going to change I dont think anyone is going to beat Texas I will be very surprised if he doesnt commit to Texas immediately after returning from his AM visit Texas early commitments include seven offensive linemen In addition to Young the OLs are Mike Garcia of Galena Park who switched from AM to Texas Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village Roman Reeves of Livingston Will

Tuesday at Frank Denius Fields at th and Red River Ill publish official heights and weights on the freshmen when UT weighs and measures them in the next few days The reason only freshmen reported Monday was that DT Stevie Lee and DB Phillip Geiggar both enrolled in January and went through spring training and DTs Sonny Davis and Marcel Moses failed to qualify academically and are going to junior colleges Two walkons also showed up with the freshmen To show up early walkons have to receive invitations because most walkons dont start practicing until school starts The walkons both

the defensive backfield and Tony Jeffery of Houston Klein Forest wants to play wide receiver and he said both will get their wishes Brown said Roy Williams of Odessa Permian B J Johnson of South Grand Prairie Sloan Thomas of Klein and Jeffery will all be wide receivers and he said all four will be given hurryup instructions to try to get them ready to play early because the Longhorns have no returning regulars at wide receiver Vasher an exceptional athlete who was a rare twoway firsttime AllState performer last year could work his way into the Longhorns dime package six defensive backs during the season because he has the speed meters to go along with good height at about or that the coaches like in their cornerbacks Brown said bumpandrun coverage is something the receivers and cornerbacks will have to work on to earn playing time If a wide receiver cant separate from the defensive back hes not going to play Brown said He told me earlier this year that the thing that makes Florida State so good every year is they can play bump and run on defense and they can beat bump and run on offense He said the wide receivers the Longhorns recruited this year can go a long ways toward beating bumpandrun coverage Several people have asked about the status of C Marcel Blanchard He received a medical hardship scholarship because of chronic shoulder problem and is no longer playing football The Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Buffaloes made a big impression on the states top QB prospect Friday and Saturday Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch flew to Colorado Friday with his father and came home late Saturday He had told me he probably would commit to Texas right after he returned from Colorado but now he says he wants to wait and take a few official visits and probably wont announce his choice until midOctober Boulder is really a beautiful city he said The coaches at Colorado are really impressive They have the program on the right track and they are

looking forward to meshing the two groups together he said This is a very exciting time for everyone involved with Texas football Brown said the Longhorns dont deserve their No national ranking heading into the season but he said the team has a chance to improve enough to deserve the high ranking later this year He has cited the loss of all the starters at wide receiver and defensive end as two of the main reasons he thinks the team doesnt deserve a top ranking right now That talented freshmen class includes the best three wide receivers Ive seen in Texas Roy Willliams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the years Ive been doing this plus another outstanding prospect who is a former quarterback Tony Jeffery It also includes Adam Doiron and Kalen Thornton two big quick defensive ends who have a lot of potential Brown said it is rare for true freshmen to be play a major role on a good team before midseason but some of the veteran defensive backs who came out to watch the freshman receivers Tuesday afternoon said they dont think it will take Williams Johnson Thomas and Jeffery that long Starting free safety Greg Brown said They are really good players They are big and they have great speed I think they have a chance to help us a lot Starting cornerback Rod Babers never one to shy away from a challenge said he plans to welcome the rookies by showing them a bigtime hit at the line of scrimmage but he too said he was impressed They are really fast and they all catch the ball pretty good he said They have good height too Until the youngsters start knocking heads with the varsity nothing is certain but the early betting would be on at least two of the young wide receivers to play major roles on the Longhorn team Some of you have asked me to break down the current list of commitments and the prospects for adding more commitments on a positionbyposition basis Its a little to early to do any guessing about future commitments at wide receiver and defensive back because the coaches probably will wait to see a few high school games before deciding which WRs and DBs to go after But heres the way it looks to me at the other spots national top players are underlined QB no commitment Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel the highest rated QBs in their respective states are the two main prospects UT should get one of them RB no commitment Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and Anthony Johnson of Jefferson are the two most likely future Longhorns but Jabari Davis of Tucker Ga and Eric Shelton of Lexington Ky are two superstars who say they plan to visit UT James Buchanon of Sarasota Fla is the only fullback UT is recruiting TE no commitment James Moses of Galena Park North Shore is the only tight end on the UT horizon OL

guard Antwan KirkHughes is the most improved offensive linemen but he also said We feel like all five offensive line starters will be quality players The team appears to be thinner at guard than tackle on offense but the coaches have moved backup tackle Robbie Doane to guard That is a sure sign that they like the work of massive true freshman Lionel Garr at offensive tackle They want to have four tackles and four guards With Leonard Davis and Mike Williams starting at tackle and Cory Quye and Garr backing them up and KirkHughes and Derrick Dockery starting at guard and Doane and Tillman Holloway backing them up they get their desired twodeep Broad also said junior squadman Corey Bradford has been looking good at tackle At center starter Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from Beau Baker Brown also has said a lot of true freshmen will play this year If we think they can help us win theyll play he said following a twohour practice session Sunday Morning True freshman WR Roy Williams and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis both in the range had outstanding practices Looking at the freshmen it appears likely that will play They are Garr WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery TE Brock Edwards DEs Adam Doiron and Kalen Thonton DT Stevie Lee CB Nathan Vasher LB Austin Sendlein safety Phillip Geiggar punter Justin Smith and kicker Matt McFadden Brown has said he wants to use the two kickers at least in backup roles so they will have a little experience when they take over the two jobs next year TE Bo Scaifes seasonending knee injury has the coaches putting Edwards on the fast track to get him ready to play quickly TE coach Tim Brewster says Edwards is picking up things very quickly Brown said The thing that Bo gave us was great speed down the field Brock Edwards looks pretty fast too and hes ahead of where Bo was last year because of Bos knee Scaife came to Texas after undergoing surgery on his other knee The true freshmen who probably wont play barring a rash of injuries at their positions are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran FB Will Matthews OLs Trey Bates and Jason Glynn and LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas Mock as the third quarterback behind Chris Simms and Major Applewhite will be trained to be ready to play but Brown said he hopes to redshirt him He has been looking very good Beltran and Matthews also look good but the Horns are deep at their positions Brown also has said he hopes to redshirt some offensive linemen and Bates and Glynn are the likely candidates Correction Oh boy when I mess up I mess up

guy I figured the offense could least afford to lose because of his blitzbreaking capabilities tore the ACL in his left knee during the Longhorns first varsity workout Friday morning and he will be out for the season Scaife a surehanded tight end with great speed had surgery on his right knee as a senior in high school He was slowed by that injury last season but regained his speed by the spring and was sensational in spring drills Coach Mack Brown said Scaife will undergo surgery and will miss the entire season The only good news is that he can use this season as a redshirt season since he did play some last season That means he will have three years of eligibility remaining beginning in Now he will have had them both fixed theyll be stronger and maybe he can have three good years Brown said Brown said Mike Jones the starter last season at tight end is a surehanded receiver and outstanding blockers but he said the Horns will miss Scaifes speed He said freshman Brock Edwards who also has speed but not as much as Scaife will get a lot of work starting Saturday to see if he can help take up some of the slack left by Scaifes injury He also said walkon TE Cullen Loeffler has shown some good things and also will get a chance to see if he can contribute This was a major blow to the Texas offense but there is some good news The Longhorns probably have their best secondary since but freshman WR Roy Williams longarmed and fast fast fast treated the starting cornerbacks and safeties like cannon fodder in the morning workout catching two long touchdown passes and tightroping the sideline for two other big catches He dropped only one pass all day and it was when he ran over an obstacle The team worked primarily on putting in some running plays in the afternoon workout so the DBs were spared another dose of Williams in the afternoon All of the heralded freshmen WRs are looking good but Williams is looking sensational I can see why some veteran West Texas football watchers say he is the greatest prospect ever to come out of Odessa Permian There just arent a lot of people his size who can run meters in high jump seven feet and broad jump a state record Even defensive coordinator Carl Reese was impressed by Williams I tell you what he didnt look like a freshman to me Reese said He looked pretty good out there Sloan Thomas B J Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen WRs and they all had their moments Friday Thomas made some acrobatic catches on balls that appeared to be overthrown Johnson and Jeffery a high school QB star who is making the switch to WR both used their quickness to get off the line of scrimmage and make some impressive grabs The Longhorns are loaded at QB with AllBig Major Applewhite battling budding star Chris Simms for the starting job Both looked very sharp throwing long and short Friday but freshman CB Nathan Vasher and backup linebacker O J McClintock picked off two of Simms passes and both might have scored if it had been in a gametype scrimmage Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery appeared to be back to normal He showed as much mobility as he has ever had in rolling right or left and his passes were on target Simms also had a good day except for the two interceptions RECRUITING NOTES Dont be surprised if the official visit for DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn is moved from the scheduled Sept date Hall has a game Friday night Sept and UTs game on Saturday Sept starts at am UT can have a jet plane waiting for Hall after his game and it can fly him to Austin but his parents want to come on his visit to Austin too But NCAA rues dont allow schools to transport parents So the parents would have to fly commercially which means they would either have to leave before his high school game that Friday or come in Saturday in which case they would be too late for the Texas season opener against Louisiana Lafayette The early emphasis in Texas recruiting has been on offensive linemen Look for the late emphasis to be on signing five or six defensive linemen including some big ends who might grow into tackles The True Orange Fax Service includes at least faxes a year and costs by EMail The

Wood possibly the greatest high school coach in Texas history after leading Stamford and Brownwood to multiple state championships before retiring several years ago says Benson is the best running

Subject FW Inside Texas FaxEmail Service Inside Texas Fax Service Vol No Monday Aug Insidetx Inc W Anderson Austin TX for faxes by email Its hard to remember a running back in the state of Texas who has entered his senior season with more incredible publicity than Midland Lees Cedric Benson who committed to Texas Thursday night ending months of sometimes frenzied speculation about his plans and the plans of the Texas coaching staff with regard to him Just as an example hes on the cover of Dave Campbells all by himself a first for a highschooler in the year history of that venerable magazine and hes got high school coaches showering him with praise some calling him the best high school running back theyve ever seen Which is why after talking to him I came away so impressed by his maturity and seeming levelheadedness about the whole thing He answered my questions in a thoughtful and articulate manner and seemed pretty unfazed by the hype This is a young man who cares as much about his performance in the classroom as on the field and he appears to be doing a helluva job in both In short Benson looks like exactly the type of player and person with whom Mack Brown wants to build his program I caught up with Cedric last Saturday afternoon after his Lee team had traveled hours roundtrip by bus to El Paso for a Friday scrimmage So what was it about the Longhorns that made you decide to finally commit to them Benson Theyre doing a great job of recruiting both offensively and defensively Theyve recruited great quarterbacks and receivers so I feel like all they need is a great running back and well be pretty balanced Here at Lee thats how weve been the last couple of years which has enabled us to win state championships and I feel like with a balanced offense nobody will be able to stop us Were you keeping up with the job Texas has been doing recruiting offensive lineman this summer and did that play any role in your decision Benson Yeah definitely Obviously youve been the subject of a huge amount of publicity what with being on the cover of Dave Campbells and having various high school coaches calling you the best high school back theyve ever seen How have you reacted to that Benson I take it as a big compliment when you get coaches at a high level saying that you are a great athlete its just a great compliment but its my job not to let it go to my head Ive still got a lot of work to do here at Lee both schoolwise and footballwise before I go off to school Speaking of Lee back to back state titles thats amazing Do you think youve got a team this season that can make it a threepeat Benson Yeah with a lot of dedication and hard work we can do it again Do you have any personal goals for yourself this season Benson My main goal is just to win and I want to make straight As Ive been thinking about that a lot So you dont get too caught up in the rushing titles and the touchdown records and so forth Benson No because those come along with winning you know If I get out there and work real hard and the team works real hard and we win then I will maybe come out of the game with yards or yards rushing and three or four touchdowns so that just comes along with winning How would you describe your running style what are youre strengths Benson I dont really think I could compare myself to anybody else Im a pretty balanced act I can run my strength is good I can catch and I have good vision Are you featured much out of the backfield at Lee Benson Yeah we do a lot of rollout passes and a lot of screen passes So have the Texas coaches talked to you about how they see you fitting into their offensive scheme Benson No not really and I didnt really question them about it either because Im pretty sure they are focused on what theyve gotta do right now but well talk more about football later What are your physical numbers right now Benson Im probably around right now and about pounds I run a on the track and a on grass So you are done with recruiting and are solid for Texas Benson Yeah I am Im glad to get it all over with and just be a kid again for my last year Finally is there anything youd like to tell the Texas fans out there about yourself as you head into your senior season and beyond that at UT Benson I just want them to know theyll be getting a great guy and a hard football player Pearle Practice notes After a lackluster scrimmage performance Saturday at DKR the Texas offense returned to the field Monday morning with a renewed vigor For probably the first time all fall the offensive players made more noise than their defensive counterparts hooting and hollering after every big offensive play Brett Robin and BJ Johnson provided the biggest screaminducing plays Robin with a barreling draw play run that left Greg Brown flat on his back and Johnson with a catchandrun TD from Major where he outleapt and then outran defender Nathan Vasher After reevaluating the scrimmage and our staff meeting yesterday we felt like that there was more intensity on defense than there was on offense Mack Brown said The offense though came out today and fought back and had some intensity Carl Reese said after practice that he expects Kalen Thornton to see action at RDE in the opener vs LouisianaLafayette The Dcoordinator said hes pleased with the play of Jermain Anderson as the starter at the position but the coaches plan to keep him fresh which Reese says keeps him effective by rotating players in including Cole Pittman and Thornton Speaking of Pittman he saw a lot of work today at LDE because Cory Redding sat out with a sore knee and sore shoulder Brown said Redding would miss Wednesdays final scrimmage and possibly return for Thursdays workout Derrick Dockery has an infected cyst on as Brown put it his rear end and missed Mondays workouts The coach said Dockery is running a fever and is feeling very sick and probably wont be back until next week Tillman Holloway took the firstteam snaps at LG in Dockerys place Ervis Hill did not practice again today because of his sore knee The Texas doctors believe there is not any serious damage to the knee but he will miss the scrimmage Wednesday before possibly

Service Volume FaxEMail Wednesday August Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Have Final Public Scrimmage Before Huge Crowd Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a short but spirited scrimmage Wednesday night in Royal Memorial Stadium before an enthusiastic crowd UT officials estimated at about With the firstteam defense sitting out most of the scrimmage the offenses dominated most of the way Chris Simms hit of passes for yards including a yard touchdown pass to freshman sensation Roy Williams who had set up the score with a great catch of a yard Simms throw and a yard TD pass to WR Montrell Flowers off a fake reverse The firstteam offense also scored on a twoyard run by TB Victor Ike after starting TB Hodges Mitchell set it up with a yard gallop But QB Major Applewhite led the secondteam offense to two touchdowns hitting of for yards including scoring tosses of yards to the other sensational freshman WR B J Johnson and yards to senior Brandon Healy Applewhites TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and Johnson just ran away from all the pursuit Starting safety Greg Brown intercepted one of Applewhites throws on the secondteams first possession Brown still wouldnt give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the season opener next week but did say both QBs played well Brown also said I was really pleased with the wide receivers I thought they made some steps in running better routes and making the tough catches He also said Ike is clearly the No TB behind Mitchell at this point Redshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring but has not been dominating during the current practices He also has had some nagging injuries Brown said Ike the fastest of the tailbacks has been doing well in practice Victor has been doing the best since hes been here Brown said He is doing much better without the ball blocking than he has in the past Defensive coordinator Carl Reese who has nine starters back says he is feeling better about his new defensive ends Ive got four guys I think can play Reese said Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters and Kaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job He just keeps getting better so hell be the first backup for Anderson and Cole Pittman has had three solid scrimmages in a row so hell be the guy behind Redding I think all four of them will play a lot and theyre the four main ones right now Thornton a true freshman is one of the larger DEs at about but Reese said he is pretty quick out there He gets a good rush from the edge and thats what we like He also is learning to do a better job against the run He said Pittman who was moved over from tackle to provide better run support has been doing a good job against the run and hes a pretty good pass rusher too

over LouisianaLafayette for Saturdays am season opener in Austin For those of you who dont live in Austin and who plan to come to the game this is the hottest summer I have seen in Austin with temperatures hitting and with disturbing regularity so I would advise you to wear something cool and arrange to have plenty of liquids to drink The team returned to practice Monday after getting three days off to recuperate from adays and freshman WR Roy Williams made a spectacular catch of a ball that looked like it was over everyone Coach Mack Brown said he wont name a starting quarterback publicly until the game starts and wont even break the news to Major Applewhite and Chris Simms the two quarterbacks who are competing for the starting job until Saturday morning We want to watch them in practice all week Brown said He also said both QBs are working hard and competing for the starting job We have told our team we have two starters Brown said We are just happy they are both really good In making these decisions we will try to take care of both of them and do what is best for the team All of the injured starters who missed some time last week were back at practice Monday but they didnt run with the first team Brown said as of today redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway would start at left guard because Derrick Dockery missed most of last week sophomore Cole Pittman would start ahead of Cory Redding at DE because Redding was injured last week and Roderick Babers who is locked in a battle with Ervis Hill at CB would get the nod because Hill missed some workouts with an injury But the game isnt today and Brown said the players who were hurt will have an opportunity this week to regain their starting jobs Brown also said he hasnt decided whether to start any true freshmen and said he probably wont make a final decision on that until close to game time too because sometimes you tell a freshman he is going to start and he starts hyperventilating Whether or not they start freshman WRs Williams and B J Johnson will play early and often They are the most impressive freshmen wide receivers I have seen at Texas Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney were a very good pair but Williams and Johnson look better and Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery the other two freshmen WRs arent too far behind Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also says freshman CB Nathan Vasher and freshman DE Kalen Thornton will play Saturday RECRUITING NOTES Greg Barnum the center from Killeen Ellison who left Tennesse and considered transferring to Texas enrolled at Stephen F Austin and says he plans to stay there for the remainder of his career DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn says he is still planning to take his official visit to Texas this weekend and super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison

country after a great summer season in AAU ball had narrowed her choices to Texas and Iowa State and she visited the Cyclones last weekend then came home and called the Texas coaches to say she wants to play for the Longhorns I just really like Texas she said Joel Nelson of Flower Mound who coached her in AAU play this summer said Heather is a great player She can bring the ball down court she hit of her threepointers for us and she was the best player on an AAU team that finished fourth in the country She could play guard forward or center at the college level and be very good at any of those positions I know teams like Texas Tech Arkansas Iowa State and several others wanted her too I think shes the best player in the state He said she averaged points rebounds and assists in a game AAU

question he said We are not likely to start a true freshman but several of them will get into the game pretty quickly WRs Roy Williams and B J Johnson DE Kalen Thornton DT Stevie Lee and CB Nathan Vasher are the freshmen who are most likely to see quick action Brown said redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway probably will start at left guard but he said Derrick Dockery who had been starting before missing some practice because of a large cyst will play a lot too Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said sophomore DE Cole Pittman has been playing really well If he keeps playing like he has well probably move him over to the other end as the starter and have Jermain Anderson be a swing guy who can substitute at either end Pittman has been backing up Cory Redding at right end He might start at right end Saturday because Redding also has missed some practice with a knee sprain But Reese said Redding and Pittman are my two best ends right now so I might move Pittman Im still not happy with the end play but well keep working on it Texas has nine defensive starters back but the two regulars who graduated were DEs Aaron Hmphrey and Cedric Woodard Brown said he is pleased with the team leadership on defense and he said the offense seems to be developing more leadership He also said he is pleased with the way the team has worked in the record heat in Austin on Monday and on Tuesday

to miss the game Scaife is out for the season after undergoing knee surgery in late August and Thompson will miss most or all of the season after undergoing knee surgery following spring practice

Simms worked with the first team during Tuesdays practice and if past practices mean anything that is a pretty good sign that he will start Saturday night against Houston Simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the start Junior Major Applewhite worked with the first team prior to the Stanford game and he got the start Coach Mack Brown wont say who will start at quarterback but it doesnt make a lot of sense to have your starting QB working with the second team so it looks like Simms will get his second start Saturday Simms is more mobile than Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery and he also led the Horns to their first touchdown Saturday at Stanford despite only getting snaps to Applewhites Applewhite led the Longhorns to their other two touchdowns but they were both in the fourth quarter Brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the Texas fans who are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk shows are hurt Thats the way we feel too Our players are hurt and our coaches are hurt None of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times But he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense rolling again and shore up the punting team after Stanford scored a touchdown on a blocked punt Brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its punter up shorter than usual Hes yards back just like every other team in the country and we try to get the punt off in seconds or less He got the one that was blocked off in seconds but a kid who blocked it perfectly on the other punts let his guy come through untouched and it got blocked The Longhorns may have some other punts blocked but my sources tell me Brown chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make that same mistake again Folks I guarantee you Brown his assistants and his players are more upset than any of you over the happenings at Palo Alto and they are working hard this week to correct things Remember the guy the stadium was named after was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in years at Texas Bobby Bowden is a pretty good coach too and his perfect season at Florida State last year was his first one TB Hodges Mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against Stanford and the coaches have corrected that Brown also said backup TB Victor Ike will play more Saturday than he has been playing and he said redshirt freshman Kenny Hayter also might see considerable action Were going to play as many as it takes Brown said We have to get our running game going better He also said LG Derrick Dockery might be able to return to fulltime duty Saturday He has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized for an infected cyst That would help us a lot he said Derrick is one of our top offensive linemen Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson will start at strong safety Saturday in place of Lee Jackson who has a pulled hamstring and will miss the Houston game Reese said Pearson has a lot of talent but he said Jacksons experience will be missed Reese also said he will look at freshman Nathan Vasher and juniors Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill to replace Pearson in the Longhorns nickel and dime packages He said the team

Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Bound for Holiday Bowl to Face Oregon or Oregon State The Longhorns accepted a bid Wednesday to play in the Friday Dec Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego and their opponent will be either Oregon or Oregon State Both Oregon teams shared the Pac title with Washington which is playing Purdue in the Rose Bowl Oregon State will be the Longhorns opponent unless the Beavers get a berth in one of the BCS bowls probably the Fiesta If OSU gets a Fiesta bid then Texas would play Oregon The Holiday Bowl kickoff will be at pm Texas time Longhorn fans can purchase tickets by calling the UT Ticket Office at BEVO or local fans can call If anyone wants to buy tickets in person the ticket office is located on the first floor in Bellmont Hall Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns are excited about accepting this invitation and he said they are also excited about playing either of the Oregon teams because both are ranked in the top Brown also said the game should help Texas recruiting efforts in California and throughout the Pac area because of its location and he also said it should help recruiting nationally because it is a nationally televised ESPN game that does not compete with any other game that evening Brown said the Longhorns will resume practice on Dec but he said some of the coaches will work with some of the players next week Most of the coaches are on the road recruiting this week and many of them will be out again next week Recruiting is our top priority right now Brown said Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said QB Major Applewhite should be close to by Dec but neither he nor Brown would indicate whether Applewhite will get his starting job back or if the nod will go to sophomore Chris Simms who was sensational in leading the Longhorns to a win over archrival Texas AM last Friday My crystal ball tells me it will be Simms because a he had a great game in his last outing and b he is completely healthy while there will be some questions about Applewhites sore knee until he actually takes a lick on it I also think the coaches would feel more comfortable with the idea of Applewhite relieving Simms if Simms had problems than they would be with Simms handling the pinchhitting role FOOTBALL NOTES Brown said he will use the bowl practices to take a closer look at several of the freshman who have been redshirted He said he usually watches them during the season but said so many of the freshmen were playing regularly that the coaches were spending an abnormal amount of time getting them ready which prevented him from seeing as much of the redshirts as he would have liked He said FB Will Matthews and TB Sneezy Beltran are two freshmen he wants to take a good look at to see if they can help the team next year Both Matthews and Beltran have been very impressive on the scout team and Brown is looking for a TB to replace senior Hodges Mitchell and he also wants to give Matthews a shot at competing with FB Matt Trissel FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES The private schools in Texas generally arent the ones who produce top talent for the colleges but two freshmen TE Brock Edwards of Fort Worth Christian and DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St Marks started several games for Texas this year There are some top seniors at the private schools again this year headed by DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas Jesuit There also is a junior QB at Midland Christian who will be hearing from some of the top colleges next year He is Jamie Beeghley He led Midland Christian to the state title last week and hit of passes for yards and ran for more yards in the championship game victory over Fort Worth Christian This year was the year of the offensive linemen which was great for the Longhorns because they needed to sign five or six really good ones and they already have been assured of filling that need Next year probably will be the year of the defensive linemen and that is very good for Texas because the Horns need to sign a bunch of them Ive already seen four or five who would be top recruits this year if they were seniors I mentioned several of them in my last emailfax and Ill write more about them

mens and womens basketball are the only other major revenue sports and none of them produce as much revenue as they spend FOOTBALL NOTES Longhorn ticket sales are lagging for the Holiday Bowl are lagging and Oregon fans are snapping up some of the tickets that were allotted to Texas fans If Longhorn fans dont step up quickly Oregon fans are going to occupy the vast majority of the seats in San Diego on Dec The Longhorns begin practicing for the bowl game Thursday All the practices will be closed to the public Former Longhorn and pro football great Harley Sewell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this week Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis who missed most of this season with a sore shin will get a look at TE in spring practice With the emergence of freshman receivers Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas the pound Ellis might have a better chance of seeing meaningful playing time by beefing up a little and playing tight end Another spring move that is being contemplated is seeing if sophomore LG Derrick Dockery could move over to LT to replace departing senior Leonard Davis Texas has three good guards in Dockery Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway Mike Williams is the only returning tackle who has seen a lot of action In addition to getting the best five linemen on the field at the same time that move might give the offensive line more fire because Holloway is a very aggressive lineman The offensive line has frequently been cited as lacking fire and leadership FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns are having their annual football banq uet this weekend Most of the players making official visits will be players who already are committed to Texas but there are at least two exceptions OL William Winston of Houston Madison and S Rufus Harris of La Porte are both scheduled to visit Super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco now says he is going to take all of his visits in January Texas leads for Winston and Johnson and it it a UTAM battle
