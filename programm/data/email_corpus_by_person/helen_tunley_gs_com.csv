Gavyn Davies Goldman Sachs Re The Global Oil Price Shock Since our meeting in Houston the spike in world oil prices has gripped the attention of financial markets I attach a paper which analyses the genesis of the present oil price increase the likelihood of it proving permanent and the probable impact on the world economy The bottom line is the following The recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to an increase in global demand and not to the activities of OPEC operating as an oil cartel In fact OPEC does not seem to have enough immediate supply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months The danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter even with normal weather conditions This could lead to temporary spikes in the price to well over barrel We see a similar situation or worse developing in natural gas However we do not see this situation as permanent In terms of deep fundamentals the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only about barrel Within about months a large increase in the supply of oil should push prices back down again possibly quite sharply Our present forecast for the average oil price in is barrel somewhat below todays spot price levels But we do not expect to see this oil price downturn before next summer If oil prices do indeed average bl in this will prove to be an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude as the Gulf War shock a decade ago It will reduce net disposable income for the OECD economies by about and add about to headline inflation numbers All of these effects will already be in the data by about Q so on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects through On this oil price scenario GDP growth in the developed economies will slow from about in to about in not a bad outturn What if the oil price sustains bl next year This would give us another round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para above Even then however these effects should not be enough to push the world into recession Growth should still be adequate at about The main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices and possible oil shortages this winter cause a drop in equity prices and a large dip in business and consumer confidence This could then lead to a more pronounced downturn in GDP next year especially if it triggers the kind of correction in the US that Larry and I have been worrying about for a long time But this should prove just about avoidable assuming sensible policy responses This may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of Going into the winter events occur which make people worry about recession Business and consumer confidence and equity markets take a dip But then things improve
