marktomarket and accrual income exposure of million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB Mr Talwars view is that as long as the PPA is valid EFI has the right to collect the fee If however the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEBs claim then EFI would not be entitled to the fee I just want to point out that as DPC and Enron is working for a resolution EFIs role should also be considered And along those lines EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected Please call me at to discuss Tushar Original Message From Edison Andrew Sent Saturday September PM To Viverito John Leach Doug Dhruv Tushar Cc Aronowitz Alan Subject FW Fuel Management Agreement Gentlemen I think this email I received early Saturday morning directly and succinctly answers the questions we posed to Indian counsel Lets talk at your convenience Andy Original Message From suresh talwar ENRON Sent Sat AM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject RE Fuel Management Agreement Dear Andy The answers to each of your questions is as follows There is no theory under Indian law that Enron could use to make an enforceable claim against MSEB in the context of the facts placed before us The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law However Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not apart from stating that DPC will be Enrons agent stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes Yes our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement However if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee either as such or by way of damage then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC Kind regards Suresh Original Message From SMTP Sent Friday September PM To Cc Subject RE Fuel Management Agreement I am a little bit confused Is there any theory under Indian law we could use to make a claim against MSEB In America we might have a claim under an agency relationship or a third party beneficiary claim Is there any such creature under Indian law Is your advice that we have no claim whatsoever Original Message From suresh talwar ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESsureshtalwarCsureshEtalwarcrawfordbayleyEcomE NRONcom Sent Friday September AM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject Fuel Management Agreement Hello Andy I refer to your email of th September seeking clarification in respect of the advice we gave you on the th of September on the Fuel Management Agreement Agreement You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc EnronFuel Manager could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any potential theories such as agency relationship third party beneficiary claims etc MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement These include amongst others approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed by the Fuel Manager providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA etc There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf Enrons right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement is contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by the provisions of the PPA to which Enron is not a party Therefore there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEBDPC as regards the PPA As a result Enron has no claim against MSEB for nonpayment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions under the Agreement I trust I have answered your query adequately Please feel free to call for any questions that you may have Kind regards

<6449681.1075858577329.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,e..haedicke@enron.com,2001-07-12 07:58:02,Mandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading ContractsNonPrivilegedpst One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se rvices EWS manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights This is par ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com modity lines including gas power coal steel pulp and paper each of wh ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat ed entities to trade the various commodities Absent express contractual s etoff rights EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWSs credit position with counterparties with w hom we trade multiple commodities This setoff language which is set fort h below must be in all EWS trading form contracts Similarly when negoti ating on third party paper we should request that this additional setoff l anguage be added MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR EWS TRADING CONTRACTS A Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D ate the NonDefaulting Party X may at its option and in its discretio n setoff against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party Y by X or a ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreements ins truments or undertakings any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of Xs Affi liates under this Agreement or under any other agreements instruments or undertakings The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X andor Xs Affiliates X will give Y not ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff For purposes of this Section Owed shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable regardless o f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced as of the Early Term ination Date Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be conver ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t he rate of exchange at which X acting in a reasonable manner and in good f aith would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c onverted If an obligation is unascertained X may in good faith estimate t hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate subject to the releva nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained Nothi ng in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other securit y interest except as may be provided under applicable law This setoff pr ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff netting offset combination of accounts counterclaim lien or other righ t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled whether by operatio n of law contract or otherwise Each of the parties represent and acknow ledge that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions The parties further ackno wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip al and with respect to this Section as agent on behalf of its Affilia tes which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and oth erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section B Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre ement the NonDefaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default ing Party any amount under Section until the NonDefaulting Party receiv es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion which may include an opinion of its counsel that all other obligations of any kind w hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the NonDefaultin g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag reements instruments or undertakings which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du e and owing as of the Early Termination Date but does not include future p ayments between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates triangular se toff after the designation of an Early Termination Date This language ha s been reviewed by US bankruptcy counsel and is appropriate under US l aws for commodity transactions with USbased counterparties Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability In addition prior to introducing this language into your forms changes will be require d to terminology andor to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default eg Affected Party under ISDA Finally when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms please be aw are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term s monthly netting of receivables or the closeout netting procedures app licable upon the designation of an Event of Default both of which should remain in the trading forms Rather this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms When incorporating this setoff la nguage into your trading forms you will need to review the forms to determ ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi ll need to be overridden andor coordinated Finally in order to assist a ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties This explanation will be distribut ed shortly If you have any questions please contact me at or Elizabet h Sager at
