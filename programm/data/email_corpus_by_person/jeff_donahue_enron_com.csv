<31939246.1075852815998.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeff.donahue@enron.com,2001-09-10 14:15:55,Ken and Greg Prior to your potential meeting on Wednesday I just wanted to get my two cents in with respect to Heath Schiesser and the Xlerator I vote in favor of supporting the Xlerator based on a few rationales First and foremost Heath is a quality player with a unique set of skills that would contribute to Enrons human capital The discipline that the Xlerator would bring to new businesses in and of itself probably justifies its existence for example I believe that the investment in AMPS approaches million much of which is at risk due to inadequate discipline and The Xlerator appears to be a low cost RD option of relatively limited size while compared to Enron that may very well incubate businesses which create meaningful value for Enron At the same time I acknowledge the costs both financial and resources and risks but feel the above benefits are greater Although support from the Management Committee would be nice I believe that support from you two would provide the foundation upon which Heath and the Xlerator can be successful Jeff Donahue
