Subject The Letter This is really good To Osama and the Boys from an American Wife and Mother Yo Osama Well the government finally named you as a suspect so I guess its fair to talk about you now Thought you had us didnt you What a laugh You did more to unify this country than George Washington See we Americans had gotten sort of distracted We worried about things like lockboxes taxes and who was committing hanky panky with whom We were too stressed to reach out to one another to sit down and talk with our kids to call our spouses at work and tell them we loved them We were MUCH too busy to even think about giving blood or going to the hardware store to buy and hang an American flag You changed all that Osama you and your gang of creeps I met my neighbors in the park across the street tonight We talked quietly while everybody gathered Then we lit our candles and just stood there silently holding them Without anybody saying anything we walked back to our neighborhood and set them on our doorsteps They are still burning You will never be able to put them out See Osama You think you get ticked off when someone messes with your culture your beliefs your country Just wait a minute you flea bitten miserable excuse for human DNA You havent seen anything like the anger of a MOTHER whos son has to go off to defend their homeland against your cowardice and hatred You havent seen anything like the WIFE of a fireman policeman or EMT who clings to hope wondering if hell ever return from trying to help his fellowman in your moment of destruction You havent seen anything like the WOMAN who will keep her family and her neighbors family and her best friends family and countrys family going when hope and energy falls low You havent seen anything like the good OLE GIRL who weeps tears of agony for familys shes never known or never will meet just because she cares You think the American MEN are bad You just better thank your lucky stars that you arent dealing with one of us American WOMEN right now Trust me the men are the ones showing restraint I have heard the best ideas of just how graphically you need to be disposed of lately in the beauty shop nail salon and the grocery store lines Ive had more meaningful conversations with my teenager this week than in the last couple of years combined Tonight I was driving her to a friends house when the voice of Lee Greenwood came over the radio singing Im Proud to Be an American We were stuck in traffic and normally we would have been snapping at one another She started singing along softly with the radio I joined in By the second verse we were singing at the top of our voices with the windows rolled down People stuck in traffic on either side of us joined in By the time we were finally able to move a little perfect strangers were wiping their eyes blowing their horns and shouting good wishes to one another I hung an American flag on my house yesterday for the first time in my life Id like to get another one but there are no flags or anything else red white or blue left in any store in this town My daughter and I did find some white and blue ribbon in the sewing box Tomorrow were going to make a huge blueandwhite bow and fasten it to the front grille of the car I called my husband at work today just to tell him I loved him I hadnt done that for a while too busy I guess It felt wonderful We are going to send some money to a fund to help the victims Tonight at the dinner table we talked about the various charities and tried to decide which one was best Normally we just eat and run It was the best dinner table conversation weve had in a long time We finally decided on a fund thats been set up for the children of the rescue workers who were killed in New York City Wed never given much thought to appreciating all they do for us before now My husband and I are on a waiting list to give blood Itll be awhile before our names come up there are over people ahead of us Theres been a shortage of blood in this area I wouldnt be surprised if the blood donated all across this country eventually saves more people than you killed That would be a fitting memorial to those who died Were sticking together Our politicians are rising to the occasion Rudy Giuliani and George W Bush never looked half as statesmanlike as they have this week Partisan bickering Whats that Half the Congress stood on the steps of the Capitol the other night and sang God Bless America See Osama you underestimated us And maybe for too long weve been underestimating ourselves This is the greatest strongest richest most beautiful country in the world Our firefighters policemen EMTs and people like the ones on the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania have reminded us that were also the bravest and most determined You cant destroy us and you cant stop us Because were coming Osama Just thought you oughta know And just to show you how good hearted we Americans are I will end by saying THANK YOU Not for the lives taken for which we now mourn nor for the destruction but for instilling back into the hearts of every American young and old black white red or yellow what we always knew deep down We are strong We are brave We are ONE NATION UNITED UNDER GOD We will overcome this as we have always overcame those moments that tested our very being And Osama I say this all the while asking God to forgive ME for I do not feel any compassion or have any mercy on your soul butmay you and all your cowardly friends soon sit happily in those front row seats you have reserved in Hell author unknown
