few changes marked in the draft Is this GTC only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp and a Japanese counterparty The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties With respect to footnote number you are correct the issue is covered under f Noted With respect to footnote number unless one of the parties to a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am not sure we need representation b We obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation d Noted and agreed I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled Early Termination that you have deleted Enron prefers to have Loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades I think the weather market is one where Enron would prefer to use the Loss method of calculation See a and b and inform me if this is sufficient I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent See d and inform me if this is sufficient I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable

<1817901.1075859959619.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.suttle@enron.com,2000-09-26 03:39:00,Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Cc One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs W e are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract withou t using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty wit h diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us t o consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to mee t with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that w e would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years a t this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deal s I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John NRON ECT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utiliz e same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancia l institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enro n however it is uncertain if this is achievable John CT AM To John NRON cc Jane nron ENRON Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT To clarify and also getting back to Mark Taylors argument that IBJ is one of the more sophisticated financial enterprises on the planet and considering the fact that they have agreed to Enron being the Calculation Agent is their argument that they are incapable of mark to market verification We calculate we call for margin they verify I am certain that they calculate mark to market positions with their other trading entities and their argument that they cant do so for Enron is weak If they simply refuse a CSA then we can deal with this as discussed in our phone conversation last week but this argument of theirs should be something we can get around dont you think From John NRON on AM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John You are correct

points that have been raised which are set forth below for your review IBJ has stated In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA During our recent meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial institutions I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan from IBJ of roughly US Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his input IBJs specific responses are quoted below as follows Part a Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA g We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as for a party a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor e Part We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only Part fEven though deleting the word not in this provision we can net the payments with respect to the same Transaction Due to our system incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo re Transactions in the same currency h Agreed Part a If your suggested language is included a Nondefaulting Party has to continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation which does not seem realistic We prefer to terminate Transactions when an Event of Default occurs We do not like to include the provision which releases a technical error c Agreed e We propose business days instead g We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a partys branch offices If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan we will amend this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office We hea rd that in most jurisdictions of the world it is not effective to setoff th e obligations between a party and the other partys Affiliate i Agreed to include this provision j We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation s without the other partys consent to even its Affiliates We might not get approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might cause an additional payment of tax or other cost k We will revert to you later m Agreed n Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity Transactions in the respective Confirmations I look forward to receiving your input I note that Jane McBride has start ed here at Enron Japan therefore I have copied her on this

IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Thanks for your input I agree with all of the comments you have raised As to Part n the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit h regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for transactions under the ISDA documentation I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic e relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex Therefore I have asked Baker McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an d will provide this information upon receipt Following receipt of John Suttles comments I will prepare the response to IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John Thanks John Mark CT PM To John NRON cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like

Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL The suggested change below takes care of the issue of not being able to modify the threshold level to be counterparty specific However I question whether taking the threshold level to zero might prove to be too low a threshold at least for Enron What is the danger of this provision being triggered by some nonmaterial disputed debt If having a bilateral zero threshold works from an Enron credit perspective then I think you could go forward with using this provision I am open to everyones comments on this point Let me know if you have any other questions

from the draft you have provided Please inform me with regard to paragraph a ix as to what if anything should be inserted for the event of default threshold amount I have also copied Susan Musch on this email so that she can determine if all is well from the tax perspective Once Susan signsoff from the tax perspective please inform me as to what needs to be done to load the GTCs noting that the existing EOL GTCs for Japanese weather are utilizing Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited as the counterparty My understanding is that those GTCs will then be removed I have also copied David Minns in Australia so that he is aware of the status of this matter Cheers John Brent Hendry AM To John nron cc Mark CT Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL John I am attaching the GTC with a few changes marked in the draft Is this GTC only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp and a Japanese counterparty The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties With respect to footnote number you are correct the issue is covered under f Noted With respect to footnote number unless one of the parties to a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am not sure we need representation b We obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation d Noted and agreed I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled Early Termination that you have deleted Enron prefers to have Loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades I think the weather market is one where Enron would prefer to use the Loss method of calculation See a and b and inform me if this is sufficient I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent See d and inform me if this is sufficient I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there is no withholding for either residents or nonresidents of Japan on derivative transactions Please let me know if this is not the case I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence to receive her input regarding tax issues Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments Brent
<11688990.1075860025530.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.suttle@enron.com,2000-09-26 03:39:00,Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Cc One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs W e are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract withou t using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty wit h diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us t o consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to mee t with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that w e would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years a t this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deal s I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John NRON ECT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utiliz e same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancia l institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enro n however it is uncertain if this is achievable John CT AM To John NRON cc Jane nron ENRON Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT To clarify and also getting back to Mark Taylors argument that IBJ is one of the more sophisticated financial enterprises on the planet and considering the fact that they have agreed to Enron being the Calculation Agent is their argument that they are incapable of mark to market verification We calculate we call for margin they verify I am certain that they calculate mark to market positions with their other trading entities and their argument that they cant do so for Enron is weak If they simply refuse a CSA then we can deal with this as discussed in our phone conversation last week but this argument of theirs should be something we can get around dont you think From John NRON on AM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John You are correct

ENRON Kev in CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Morten E nron Jane nron Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Isnt Enron the Calculation Agent leaving IBJ only to confirm our marks if we are to make a margin call From John NRON on AM To Mark CT cc Kevin CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Morten E nron Jane nron John CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Today we received IBJs responsive comments to the points that have been raised which are set forth below for your review IBJ has stated In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA During our recent meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial institutions I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan from IBJ of roughly US Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his input IBJs specific responses are quoted below as follows Part a Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA g We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as for a party a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor e Part We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only Part fEven though deleting the word not in this provision we can net the payments with respect to the same Transaction Due to our system incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo re Transactions in the same currency h Agreed Part a If your suggested language is included a Nondefaulting Party has to continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation which does not seem realistic We prefer to terminate Transactions when an Event of Default occurs We do not like to include the provision which releases a technical error c Agreed e We propose business days instead g We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a partys branch offices If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan we will amend this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office We hea rd that in most jurisdictions of the world it is not effective to setoff th e obligations between a party and the other partys Affiliate i Agreed to include this provision j We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation s without the other partys consent to even its Affiliates We might not get approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might cause an additional payment of tax or other cost k We will revert to you later m Agreed n Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity Transactions in the respective Confirmations I look forward to receiving your input I note that Jane McBride has start ed here at Enron Japan therefore I have copied her on this correspondence Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon Best regards John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM John Viverito AM To Mark CT cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Thanks for your input I agree with all of the comments you have raised As to Part n the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit h regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for transactions under the ISDA documentation I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic e relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex Therefore I have asked Baker McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an d will provide this information upon receipt Following receipt of John Suttles comments I will prepare the response to IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John Thanks John Mark CT PM To John NRON cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like
