Power Market DJ Ca lif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers Complaint GMT August DJ Calif Generators We Welcome Probe Into Power Market This article was originally published Tuesday By Jason Leopold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesWhen California Attorney General Bill Lockyer completes his investigation into possible collusion in the wholesale electricity market by generators energy companies say he will probably find the same thing Geraldo Rivera found in Al Capones safe nothing Still those companies that own generation in the state say they welcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer We have done nothing wrong at all said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America DUK Our plants have been running all summer long Prices are high throughout the west We wouldnt invest billion in new generation and then try and rig the market For the past two months utilities lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations that generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for the price spikes Lockers office said an investigation is still pending State regulators are also conducting their own investigation the findings of which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year Allegations Said Unsubstantiated There isnt a shred of evidence to support allegations said Severing Borenstein director of the University of California Berkleys Energy Institute There are no antitrust laws that state you cant charge a premium price for power Borenstein said Manipulation is a bad word Thats used in the commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules I would say this is exercising market power If you want to charge high prices you can These are guys who play against each other every day There is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov Gray Davis he said is as a consequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay marketbased rates for electricity The high wholesale costs paid by utility San Diego Gas Electric a unit of Sempra Energy SRE were passed on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling Gov Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own investigation as well Dynegy DYN President Steve Bergstrom also says that an investigation will turn up nothing So why conduct one This is a very politically charged issue Bergstrom said When something goes wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at A source in the governors office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyers investigation may turn up nothing but Gov Davis has a responsibility to his constituents Supply vs Demand What the investigation will turn up is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough power plants being built to meet increasing demand said Terry Winter chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator Winter said he doesnt believe that there is anything wrong with the way generators sell their power and of the time the market works well Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap per megawatthour knowing that youre MW short I have trouble identifying that as market power abuse Winter said Despite some proposed regulatory changes such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDGE customers Duke Energy Dynegy Southern Co SO and Reliant RLI all still plan to invest in generation in the state Thats a different stance than the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price cap in the realtime market to MWh At the end of the day the market is short power and you got to get people to build new generation said Dynegys Bergstrom We got a big investment in California Were not walking away from that By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc GMT August DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers Complaint This article was originally published Tuesday WASHINGTON Dow JonesCalifornias power grid administrator Monday urged federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking compensation in the event outofstate power transactions are curtailed during an extreme power grid emergency The independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations and if it were to occur in the future would do so rarely The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the states grid already allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports and decried the power producers complaint as a collateral attack on a previous FERC order rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort measure taken only after other options have been exhausted the ISO said The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of interruption in the event of a statewide grid emergency the ISO said The ISOs objections were echoed by the states electricity distribution utilities and California regulators They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from under the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in skyrocketing power prices this summer The generators knew when they purchased California power plants and when they entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their schedules in an emergency For them to ask the commission to make it even more expensive and hence more difficult for the ISO to maintain grid reliability in California is irresponsible said Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International EIX The complaint is a sham declared the California Public Utilities Commission The true intent of the complaint is to avoid the ISO price caps by making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state and sell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators market power the PUC said calling for FERC to summarily reject the complaint The complaint is factually unsupported legally unfounded complains of conduct consistent with the ISOs authority under pertinent FERC decisions and seeks to avoid the price cap the PUC said But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the complaint filed Aug by Reliant Power Generation Inc REI Dynegy Power Marketing Inc DYN and Southern Energy California SO By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price of and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers the Cal ISO would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market participants who schedule energy for export said the Electric Power Supply Association the national trade group representing competitive power producers It is critical that power producers know with certainty that the curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur more frequently Less energy will be imported into California and more energy will leave California in search of higher prices said Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co in support of the complaints call for actual damages and lost opportunity costs At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers position as well It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the transactions of others to meet its own loads that is should pay the full costs of doing so said the Northern California Power Agency By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow

Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesFor several hours on June around power customers in San Franciscos Bay Area lost electricity as Pacific Gas Electric Co struggled to reduce its overburdened network by taking accounts off line Apple Computer Inc AAPL was one of the businesses left in the dark along with other firms and consumers in a fivecounty area as the utility a unit of PGE Corp PCG rotated off blocks of customers for to minutes at a time after other attempts to reduce demand failed Apple considers itself relatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanks to a contingency plan according to spokeswoman Lynn Fox Whether that backup plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other means Apple wouldnt say What is sure is that as Silicon Valley expands through the nations most populous state and California shows no sign of quickly resolving its power problem technology firms large and small are among those businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time These big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up their regular electricity sources industry observers said and in some cases that spending may be as much of a bottomline factor as the power outages themselves Unreliable power costs the US economy about billion a year said Bernie Ziemianek of EPRI a Palo Alto Calif thinktank focused on power issues and technology Ziemianek thinks that figure which considers lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damaged during a power interruption could double in the next three to five years because of the growth of Internetrelated activity and electronic commerce Mark Mills coauthor of the Digital Power Report a trade newsletter believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasingly dependent on reliable power It is no longer just hospitals and military bases that cant do without uninterruptible power semiconductor makers telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot do without fulltime electricity By the end of the decade Internetrelated activity and ecommerce could account for about to of the total US electric demand said Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz compared with about in The new US economy can scarcely survive the annual power outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the power grid over the past few years Schultz said Hot Days Hot Economy And Hot Debate Although the California power outage made headlines across the country rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as a trafficfree Los Angeles freeway Indeed the state has never declared a socalled Stage emergency which occurs when the statewide power reserve falls below and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a wide scale Rolling blackouts have been more common in the East Coast and the Midwest which are two areas that also are susceptible to stormrelated outages While some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for the struggle to meet power demand in California others argue that hot weather and robust economic growth are to blame The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle A year ago Californias weather was cooler than usual but this year the state has had a hot summer On June the day of the Bay Area blackout the temperature in San Francisco reached degrees a level not seen for years That spike coupled with overall growth in electricity usage pushed the power grid to its limits Over a year period this state will need megawatts of additional energy to keep up with the growth we are seeing now said PGE spokesman Greg Pruett Indeed with hot summer weather and new capacity still a long way off the number of Stage emergencies California has declared is on the rise In a Stage emergency power reserves are below and many utilities begin to contact accounts that have identified themselves as interruptible customers and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts Those socalled interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrial accounts By early August the California Independent System Operator had declared nine Stage alerts said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the nonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state compared with one in and four in During a Stage alert interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption when asked in return for lower electricity rates and often help to stave off the need to resort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts However it can be a doubleedged sword for the commercial customer which can face steep fines if it fails to comply with the order Penalties can offset the savings the company stands to gain from the program and thats even before accounting for the cost of lost productivity Aerospace and defense giant Boeing Co BA and technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc IM are two companies operating facilities in California under the interruptible customer program During the first week of August each was called upon to reduce its power consumption Both companies see the program as a way to act as good members of the community while saving money The manufacturing of a rocket takes two to three years said Walt Rice a spokesman at Boeings Huntington Beach Calif facility The impact of a Stage power reduction is fairly outweighed by the cost savings he said We live in a state where there is a high demand for electricity we are doing things to shed even a small amount of that demand said Paul La Plante senior vice president of worldwide facilities for Ingram Micro Still company officials admitted compliance isnt without inconvenience Companies need to work closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptions they can tolerate Ziemianek said but that determination can be difficult to make For example while a semiconductor plant operator knows a mere brownout can destroy a days production and prepares for this event the operator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption a brownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery Digital Power Reports Mills said Companies such as Silicon Graphics Inc SGI and Qwest Communications International Inc QWST are spending more money on systems either to back up replace or supplement the electricity supplied from the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by a factor of at least five possibly said Mills The stakes are too high if you are Nasdaq a dotcom or a fab maker he said Other Power Options For that reason companies are trying to be savvier about their power usage Earlier this year Oracle Corp ORCL considered going off the power grid entirely by building its own power generation facility A spokeswoman for the Redwood Shores Calif software company wouldnt provide further details of the plans progress This option may seem severe but its one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced with extensive order backlogs and its also driving demand for uninterruptible power supplies such as those manufactured by companies like Emerson Electric Co EMR and for new power technologies such as fuel cells flywheels and microturbines some of which are still years away from commercial viability Others like Silicon Energy Co are developing products to allow utilities and their customers to better manage their electric consumption Silicons software allow its users to track their realtime electricity consumption With this in mind Mills suggests that the real financial impact of power interruptions isnt the money companies lose on these events but the value of what companies are willing to spend to cushion the blow of blackouts when they occur By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow Jones Company Inc Tel Fax The information transmitted

Brinksmanship On Grid By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias new lower cap on the price of wholesale power is intended to bring relief to consumers burned by this summers highflying electricity rates But it has also set the stage for a game of chicken between utilities and power producers with the operator of the states power grid caught in the middle and a major blackout the consequence if both sides hold their course on a hot day By creating incentives for power producers and power buyers to wait on the sidelines the price cap has put the California Independent System Operator in the position of covering much of the states power demand at the last minute something the grid operator was never intended to do Its not designed to handle a third of the load and its not designed to be the arbitrage tool for either those buying electricity or those supplying it Jan SmutnyJones chairman of the ISOs board of governors said of the ISOs realtime power market For the ISO to find MW of power on any given day is a huge undertaking that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the realtime operation of the grid Were going to be in trouble Thanks to a break in this summers high temperatures in California the ISO managed to find the power it needed Monday and bought it under the new price cap of a megawatthour It also looks to be able to make it through Tuesday But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for Wednesday and Thursday or whenever the next heat wave comes The states power grid is run by the ISO established by the states legislature to ensure that Californias utilities were getting enough power to meet their customer needs Utilities typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance based on weather forecasts and system capacity A different statechartered organization the California Power Exchange buys most of the power the utilities need one day ahead of time The ISO is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts of power on a lastminute basis as necessary But the price cap is changing the way the game is played Prices in the ISOs realtime market are capped at a megawatthour But prices in the CalPXs dayahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket As a result Californias main utilities PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric will buy only those supplies available on the dayahead market that are bid at the ISO cap or less That policy makes sense electricity is widely regarded as the most volatile commodity in existence prices can rise fold in a matter of days and Californias prices are about four times their level last summer But it isnt the most sustainable Grid Operator Left To Cover Large Shortfall On Monday for example the California PX reported that the utilities bought all the power suppliers bid in below the price cap a total of megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours But as the sun rose over the California sky and air conditioners ramped up the three utilities needed megawatts of power to meet demand leaving the ISO not just to tweak the system but to buy almost a third of what was required It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said On Monday the ISO had to leave its official computerbased market and scramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities by telephone as it has done numerous times this summer The question for California is whether independent generating companies and utilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or below the price cap or whether theyll be able to sell their output for a higher price elsewhere Like much of the rest of the country the western US now needs more electricity during summer afternoons than it can generate The booming electricitydriven new economy has been met with almost no additions to generating capacity Companies that have generating capacity are looking for top dollar Our realtime folks job is to optimize revenue and get the highest price for that energy that they can said Larry Bryant spokesman for the Public Service Co of New Mexico PNM which regularly sells power to California There is no preference of customer Theres preference for maximizing the revenue that hour of that day The cap half what it was until Monday and a third of what it was until July is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seen frequently this summer The ISO has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep the lights on but doing so could make a shambles of the states official power market Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have no incentive to bid in supply on the ISOs computer system at prices under the cap if they know the ISO will be picking up the phone later with sweeter deals At am the ISO operators have to run around and find a sufficient amount of capacity in the West to serve our needs and on some days there really is only a limited amount of capacity to go around SmutnyJones said Were going to

PICTURE Wider Econ Risks In Californias Power Woes By John McAuley Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesHot weather and a stillrobust economy have intensified electricity demand in the face of drumtight power supplies in California the nations most populous and in economic terms most important state The resultant rolling brown outs and the potential for blackouts in the future could have a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production in California and even in the national statistics Indeed the impact is likely to be greatest in the highest valueadded sectors computers and computer components two industries that have been a key engine of US growth Not only that electricity generation is an important proxy in the Federal Reserves estimation of industrial production So the measurement of statistics could be directly affected About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial production index is compiled on the basis of actual output volumes tons of steel boardfeet of lumber or millions of autos assembled etc For other forms of output accounting for about a quarter of the index contributions to total production are estimated based on hours worked data with the implicit assumption that productivity or the rate of real output per labor hour doesnt change much over short periods of time in these industries But the remainder of the index about according to a Fed economist is estimated using electricity generation measures For this purpose electricity generation is itself estimated from measures of electric power usage by industry Here as with productivity the technical coefficient or the amount of electricity input per unit of output is assumed to be constant over relatively long periods As Usual Things Are Different In California California power companies as part of the deregulation of the electric power industry offer their business customers interruptible rate plans That means that for a discounted rate customers voluntarily allow the power company to interrupt their power supply in times of peak demand Too bad The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has in fact resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both a statistical and real impact on production the San Francisco earthquake of October That quake disrupted electricity generation particularly south of the city in Silicon Valley Largely as a result of that disruption national industrial production declined by in manufacturing in October The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the state are very heavy users of electricity It is reasonable to expect that their total consumption of electricity and their output have skyrocketed since This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy First chips are essential inputs to the production of other industries from smart chips in cars to central processing units for computers Thus a bottleneck in chip supplies because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyond California Second chip production is among the highest valueadded activities in the US economy each stage of production adds significantly to the value of total output This means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatly magnified effect on overall economic activity The usage is not confined to chip production however An extensive range of other Californiabased industries from chemicals to textiles have intensive electricity usage in their production Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction in electricity And in fact real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input Ironically these interruptions could complement the Feds efforts to slow economic activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases What infuriates Californians might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us By John McAuley Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow Jones Company Inc Tel

PICTURE Wider Econ Risks In Californias Power Woes By John McAuley Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesHot weather and a stillrobust economy have intensified electricity demand in the face of drumtight power supplies in California the nations most populous and in economic terms most important state The resultant rolling brown outs and the potential for blackouts in the future could have a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production in California and even in the national statistics Indeed the impact is likely to be greatest in the highest valueadded sectors computers and computer components two industries that have been a key engine of US growth Not only that electricity generation is an important proxy in the Federal Reserves estimation of industrial production So the measurement of statistics could be directly affected About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial production index is compiled on the basis of actual output volumes tons of steel boardfeet of lumber or millions of autos assembled etc For other forms of output accounting for about a quarter of the index contributions to total production are estimated based on hours worked data with the implicit assumption that productivity or the rate of real output per labor hour doesnt change much over short periods of time in these industries But the remainder of the index about according to a Fed economist is estimated using electricity generation measures For this purpose electricity generation is itself estimated from measures of electric power usage by industry Here as with productivity the technical coefficient or the amount of electricity input per unit of output is assumed to be constant over relatively long periods As Usual Things Are Different In California California power companies as part of the deregulation of the electric power industry offer their business customers interruptible rate plans That means that for a discounted rate customers voluntarily allow the power company to interrupt their power supply in times of peak demand Too bad The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has in fact resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both a statistical and real impact on production the San Francisco earthquake of October That quake disrupted electricity generation particularly south of the city in Silicon Valley Largely as a result of that disruption national industrial production declined by in manufacturing in October The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the state are very heavy users of electricity It is reasonable to expect that their total consumption of electricity and their output have skyrocketed since This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy First chips are essential inputs to the production of other industries from smart chips in cars to central processing units for computers Thus a bottleneck in chip supplies because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyond California Second chip production is among the highest valueadded activities in the US economy each stage of production adds significantly to the value of total output This means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatly magnified effect on overall economic activity The usage is not confined to chip production however An extensive range of other Californiabased industries from chemicals to textiles have intensive electricity usage in their production Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction in electricity And in fact real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input Ironically these interruptions could complement the Feds efforts to slow economic activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases What infuriates

Brinksmanship On Grid By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias new lower cap on the price of wholesale power is intended to bring relief to consumers burned by this summers highflying electricity rates But it has also set the stage for a game of chicken between utilities and power producers with the operator of the states power grid caught in the middle and a major blackout the consequence if both sides hold their course on a hot day By creating incentives for power producers and power buyers to wait on the sidelines the price cap has put the California Independent System Operator in the position of covering much of the states power demand at the last minute something the grid operator was never intended to do Its not designed to handle a third of the load and its not designed to be the arbitrage tool for either those buying electricity or those supplying it Jan SmutnyJones chairman of the ISOs board of governors said of the ISOs realtime power market For the ISO to find MW of power on any given day is a huge undertaking that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the realtime operation of the grid Were going to be in trouble Thanks to a break in this summers high temperatures in California the ISO managed to find the power it needed Monday and bought it under the new price cap of a megawatthour It also looks to be able to make it through Tuesday But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for Wednesday and Thursday or whenever the next heat wave comes The states power grid is run by the ISO established by the states legislature to ensure that Californias utilities were getting enough power to meet their customer needs Utilities typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance based on weather forecasts and system capacity A different statechartered organization the California Power Exchange buys most of the power the utilities need one day ahead of time The ISO is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts of power on a lastminute basis as necessary But the price cap is changing the way the game is played Prices in the ISOs realtime market are capped at a megawatthour But prices in the CalPXs dayahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket As a result Californias main utilities PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric will buy only those supplies available on the dayahead market that are bid at the ISO cap or less That policy makes sense electricity is widely regarded as the most volatile commodity in existence prices can rise fold in a matter of days and Californias prices are about four times their level last summer But it isnt the most sustainable Grid Operator Left To Cover Large Shortfall On Monday for example the California PX reported that the utilities bought all the power suppliers bid in below the price cap a total of megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours But as the sun rose over the California sky and air conditioners ramped up the three utilities needed megawatts of power to meet demand leaving the ISO not just to tweak the system but to buy almost a third of what was required It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said On Monday the ISO had to leave its official computerbased market and scramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities by telephone as it has done numerous times this summer The question for California is whether independent generating companies and utilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or below the price cap or whether theyll be able to sell their output for a higher price elsewhere Like much of the rest of the country the western US now needs more electricity during summer afternoons than it can generate The booming electricitydriven new economy has been met with almost no additions to generating capacity Companies that have generating capacity are looking for top dollar Our realtime folks job is to optimize revenue and get the highest price for that energy that they can said Larry Bryant spokesman for the Public Service Co of New Mexico PNM which regularly sells power to California There is no preference of customer Theres preference for maximizing the revenue that hour of that day The cap half what it was until Monday and a third of what it was until July is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seen frequently this summer The ISO has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep the lights on but doing so could make a shambles of the states official power market Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have no incentive to bid in supply on the ISOs computer system at prices under the cap if they know the ISO will be picking up the phone later with sweeter deals At am the ISO operators have to run around and find a sufficient amount of capacity in the West to serve our needs and on some days there really is only a limited amount of capacity to go around SmutnyJones said Were going to have figure out a better way of managing this he added Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow Jones Company Inc Tel Fax The information

Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesFor several hours on June around power customers in San Franciscos Bay Area lost electricity as Pacific Gas Electric Co struggled to reduce its overburdened network by taking accounts off line Apple Computer Inc AAPL was one of the businesses left in the dark along with other firms and consumers in a fivecounty area as the utility a unit of PGE Corp PCG rotated off blocks of customers for to minutes at a time after other attempts to reduce demand failed Apple considers itself relatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanks to a contingency plan according to spokeswoman Lynn Fox Whether that backup plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other means Apple wouldnt say What is sure is that as Silicon Valley expands through the nations most populous state and California shows no sign of quickly resolving its power problem technology firms large and small are among those businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time These big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up their regular electricity sources industry observers said and in some cases that spending may be as much of a bottomline factor as the power outages themselves Unreliable power costs the US economy about billion a year said Bernie Ziemianek of EPRI a Palo Alto Calif thinktank focused on power issues and technology Ziemianek thinks that figure which considers lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damaged during a power interruption could double in the next three to five years because of the growth of Internetrelated activity and electronic commerce Mark Mills coauthor of the Digital Power Report a trade newsletter believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasingly dependent on reliable power It is no longer just hospitals and military bases that cant do without uninterruptible power semiconductor makers telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot do without fulltime electricity By the end of the decade Internetrelated activity and ecommerce could account for about to of the total US electric demand said Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz compared with about in The new US economy can scarcely survive the annual power outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the power grid over the past few years Schultz said Hot Days Hot Economy And Hot Debate Although the California power outage made headlines across the country rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as a trafficfree Los Angeles freeway Indeed the state has never declared a socalled Stage emergency which occurs when the statewide power reserve falls below and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a wide scale Rolling blackouts have been more common in the East Coast and the Midwest which are two areas that also are susceptible to stormrelated outages While some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for the struggle to meet power demand in California others argue that hot weather and robust economic growth are to blame The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle A year ago Californias weather was cooler than usual but this year the state has had a hot summer On June the day of the Bay Area blackout the temperature in San Francisco reached degrees a level not seen for years That spike coupled with overall growth in electricity usage pushed the power grid to its limits Over a year period this state will need megawatts of additional energy to keep up with the growth we are seeing now said PGE spokesman Greg Pruett Indeed with hot summer weather and new capacity still a long way off the number of Stage emergencies California has declared is on the rise In a Stage emergency power reserves are below and many utilities begin to contact accounts that have identified themselves as interruptible customers and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts Those socalled interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrial accounts By early August the California Independent System Operator had declared nine Stage alerts said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the nonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state compared with one in and four in During a Stage alert interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption when asked in return for lower electricity rates and often help to stave off the need to resort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts However it can be a doubleedged sword for the commercial customer which can face steep fines if it fails to comply with the order Penalties can offset the savings the company stands to gain from the program and thats even before accounting for the cost of lost productivity Aerospace and defense giant Boeing Co BA and technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc IM are two companies operating facilities in California under the interruptible customer program During the first week of August each was called upon to reduce its power consumption Both companies see the program as a way to act as good members of the community while saving money The manufacturing of a rocket takes two to three years said Walt Rice a spokesman at Boeings Huntington Beach Calif facility The impact of a Stage power reduction is fairly outweighed by the cost savings he said We live in a state where there is a high demand for electricity we are doing things to shed even a small amount of that demand said Paul La Plante senior vice president of worldwide facilities for Ingram Micro Still company officials admitted compliance isnt without inconvenience Companies need to work closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptions they can tolerate Ziemianek said but that determination can be difficult to make For example while a semiconductor plant operator knows a mere brownout can destroy a days production and prepares for this event the operator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption a brownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery Digital Power Reports Mills said Companies such as Silicon Graphics Inc SGI and Qwest Communications International Inc QWST are spending more money on systems either to back up replace or supplement the electricity supplied from the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by a factor of at least five possibly said Mills The stakes are too high if you are Nasdaq a dotcom or a fab maker he said Other Power Options For that reason companies are trying to be savvier about their power usage Earlier this year Oracle Corp ORCL considered going off the power grid entirely by building its own power generation facility A spokeswoman for the Redwood Shores Calif software company wouldnt provide further details of the plans progress This option may seem severe but its one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced with extensive order backlogs and its also driving demand for uninterruptible power supplies such as those manufactured by companies like Emerson Electric Co EMR and for new power technologies such as fuel cells flywheels and microturbines some of which are still years away from commercial viability Others like Silicon Energy Co are developing products to allow utilities and their customers to better manage their electric consumption Silicons software allow its users to track their realtime electricity consumption With this in mind Mills suggests that the real financial impact of power interruptions isnt the money companies lose on these events but the value of what companies are willing to spend to cushion the

will be imported into California and more energy will leave California in search of higher prices said Williams Energy Marketing Trading Co in support of the complaints call for actual damages and lost opportunity costs At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers position as well It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the transactions of others to meet its

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther PM To Golden Mark Leopold Jason cc bcc Carla HoffmanPDXECT Subject DJ POWER CUTS Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply GMT August DJ POWER CUTS Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesFor several hours on June around power customers in San Franciscos Bay Area lost electricity as Pacific Gas Electric Co struggled to reduce its overburdened network by taking accounts off line Apple Computer Inc AAPL was one of the businesses left in the dark along with other firms and consumers in a fivecounty area as the utility a unit of PGE Corp PCG rotated off blocks of customers for to minutes at a time after other attempts to reduce demand failed Apple considers itself relatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanks to a contingency plan according to spokeswoman Lynn Fox Whether that backup plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other means Apple wouldnt say What is sure is that as Silicon Valley expands through the nations most populous state and California shows no sign of quickly resolving its power problem technology firms large and small are among those businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time These big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up their regular electricity sources industry observers said and in some cases that spending may be as much of a bottomline factor as the power outages themselves Unreliable power costs the US economy about billion a year said Bernie Ziemianek of EPRI a Palo Alto Calif thinktank focused on power issues and technology Ziemianek thinks that figure which considers lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damaged during a power interruption could double in the next three to five years because of the growth of Internetrelated activity and electronic commerce Mark Mills coauthor of the Digital Power Report a trade newsletter believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasingly dependent on reliable power It is no longer just hospitals and military bases that cant do without uninterruptible power semiconductor makers telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot do without fulltime electricity By the end of the decade Internetrelated activity and ecommerce could account for about to of the total US electric demand said Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz compared with about in The new US economy can scarcely survive the annual power outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the power grid over the past few years Schultz said Hot Days Hot Economy And Hot Debate Although the California power outage made headlines across the country rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as a trafficfree Los Angeles freeway Indeed the state has never declared a socalled Stage emergency which occurs when the statewide power reserve falls below and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a wide scale Rolling blackouts have been more common in the East Coast and the Midwest which are two areas that also are susceptible to stormrelated outages While some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for the struggle to meet power demand in California others argue that hot weather and robust economic growth are to blame The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle A year ago Californias weather was cooler than usual but this year the state has had a hot summer On June the day of the Bay Area blackout the temperature in San Francisco reached degrees a level not seen for years That spike coupled with overall growth in electricity usage pushed the power grid to its limits Over a year period this state will need megawatts of additional energy to keep up with the growth we are seeing now said PGE spokesman Greg Pruett Indeed with hot summer weather and new capacity still a long way off the number of Stage emergencies California has declared is on the rise In a Stage emergency power reserves are below and many utilities begin to contact accounts that have identified themselves as interruptible customers and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts Those socalled interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrial accounts By early August the California Independent System Operator had declared nine Stage alerts said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the nonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state compared with one in and four in During a Stage alert interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption when asked in return for lower electricity rates and often help to stave off the need to resort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts However it can be a doubleedged sword for the commercial customer which can face steep fines if it fails to comply with the order Penalties can offset the savings the company stands to gain from the program and thats even before accounting for the cost of lost productivity Aerospace and defense giant Boeing Co BA and technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc IM are two companies operating facilities in California under the interruptible customer program During the first week of August each was called upon to reduce its power consumption Both companies see the program as a way to act as good members of the community while saving money The manufacturing of a rocket takes two to three years said Walt Rice a spokesman at Boeings Huntington Beach Calif facility The impact of a Stage power reduction is fairly outweighed by the cost savings he said We live in a state where there is a high demand for electricity we are doing things to shed even a small amount of that demand said Paul La Plante senior vice president of worldwide facilities for Ingram Micro Still company officials admitted compliance isnt without inconvenience Companies need to work closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptions they can tolerate Ziemianek said but that determination can be difficult to make For example while a semiconductor plant operator knows a mere brownout can destroy a days production and prepares for this event the operator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption a brownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery Digital Power Reports Mills said Companies such as Silicon Graphics Inc SGI and Qwest Communications International Inc QWST are spending more money on systems either to back up replace or supplement the electricity supplied from the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by a factor of at least five possibly said Mills The stakes are too high if you are Nasdaq a dotcom or a fab maker he said Other Power Options For that reason companies are trying to be savvier about their power usage Earlier this year Oracle Corp ORCL considered going off the power grid entirely by building its own power generation facility A spokeswoman for the Redwood Shores Calif software company wouldnt provide further details of the plans progress This option may seem severe but its one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced with extensive order backlogs and its also driving demand for uninterruptible power supplies such as those manufactured by companies like Emerson Electric Co EMR and for new power technologies such as fuel cells flywheels and microturbines some of which are still years away from commercial viability Others like Silicon Energy Co are developing products to allow utilities and their customers to better manage their electric consumption Silicons software allow its users to track their realtime electricity consumption With this in mind Mills suggests that the real financial impact of power interruptions isnt the money companies lose on these events but the value of what companies are willing to spend to cushion the

Brinksmanship On Grid By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias new lower cap on the price of wholesale power is intended to bring relief to consumers burned by this summers highflying electricity rates But it has also set the stage for a game of chicken between utilities and power producers with the operator of the states power grid caught in the middle and a major blackout the consequence if both sides hold their course on a hot day By creating incentives for power producers and power buyers to wait on the sidelines the price cap has put the California Independent System Operator in the position of covering much of the states power demand at the last minute something the grid operator was never intended to do Its not designed to handle a third of the load and its not designed to be the arbitrage tool for either those buying electricity or those supplying it Jan SmutnyJones chairman of the ISOs board of governors said of the ISOs realtime power market For the ISO to find MW of power on any given day is a huge undertaking that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the realtime operation of the grid Were going to be in trouble Thanks to a break in this summers high temperatures in California the ISO managed to find the power it needed Monday and bought it under the new price cap of a megawatthour It also looks to be able to make it through Tuesday But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for Wednesday and Thursday or whenever the next heat wave comes The states power grid is run by the ISO established by the states legislature to ensure that Californias utilities were getting enough power to meet their customer needs Utilities typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance based on weather forecasts and system capacity A different statechartered organization the California Power Exchange buys most of the power the utilities need one day ahead of time The ISO is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts of power on a lastminute basis as necessary But the price cap is changing the way the game is played Prices in the ISOs realtime market are capped at a megawatthour But prices in the CalPXs dayahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket As a result Californias main utilities PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric will buy only those supplies available on the dayahead market that are bid at the ISO cap or less That policy makes sense electricity is widely regarded as the most volatile commodity in existence prices can rise fold in a matter of days and Californias prices are about four times their level last summer But it isnt the most sustainable Grid Operator Left To Cover Large Shortfall On Monday for example the California PX reported that the utilities bought all the power suppliers bid in below the price cap a total of megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours But as the sun rose over the California sky and air conditioners ramped up the three utilities needed megawatts of power to meet demand leaving the ISO not just to tweak the system but to buy almost a third of what was required It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said On Monday the ISO had to leave its official computerbased market and scramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities by telephone as it has done numerous times this summer The question for California is whether independent generating companies and utilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or below the price cap or whether theyll be able to sell their output for a higher price elsewhere Like much of the rest of the country the western US now needs more electricity during summer afternoons than it can generate The booming electricitydriven new economy has been met with almost no additions to generating capacity Companies that have generating capacity are looking for top dollar Our realtime folks job is to optimize revenue and get the highest price for that energy that they can said Larry Bryant spokesman for the Public Service Co of New Mexico PNM which regularly sells power to California There is no preference of customer Theres preference for maximizing the revenue that hour of that day The cap half what it was until Monday and a third of what it was until July is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seen frequently this summer The ISO has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep the lights on but doing so could make a shambles of the states official power market Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have no incentive to bid in supply on the ISOs computer system at prices under the cap if they know the ISO will be picking up the phone later with sweeter deals At am the ISO operators have to run around and find a sufficient amount of capacity in the West to serve our needs and on some days there really is only a limited amount of capacity to go around SmutnyJones said Were going to

PICTURE Wider Econ Risks In Californias Power Woes By John McAuley Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesHot weather and a stillrobust economy have intensified electricity demand in the face of drumtight power supplies in California the nations most populous and in economic terms most important state The resultant rolling brown outs and the potential for blackouts in the future could have a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production in California and even in the national statistics Indeed the impact is likely to be greatest in the highest valueadded sectors computers and computer components two industries that have been a key engine of US growth Not only that electricity generation is an important proxy in the Federal Reserves estimation of industrial production So the measurement of statistics could be directly affected About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial production index is compiled on the basis of actual output volumes tons of steel boardfeet of lumber or millions of autos assembled etc For other forms of output accounting for about a quarter of the index contributions to total production are estimated based on hours worked data with the implicit assumption that productivity or the rate of real output per labor hour doesnt change much over short periods of time in these industries But the remainder of the index about according to a Fed economist is estimated using electricity generation measures For this purpose electricity generation is itself estimated from measures of electric power usage by industry Here as with productivity the technical coefficient or the amount of electricity input per unit of output is assumed to be constant over relatively long periods As Usual Things Are Different In California California power companies as part of the deregulation of the electric power industry offer their business customers interruptible rate plans That means that for a discounted rate customers voluntarily allow the power company to interrupt their power supply in times of peak demand Too bad The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has in fact resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both a statistical and real impact on production the San Francisco earthquake of October That quake disrupted electricity generation particularly south of the city in Silicon Valley Largely as a result of that disruption national industrial production declined by in manufacturing in October The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the state are very heavy users of electricity It is reasonable to expect that their total consumption of electricity and their output have skyrocketed since This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy First chips are essential inputs to the production of other industries from smart chips in cars to central processing units for computers Thus a bottleneck in chip supplies because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyond California Second chip production is among the highest valueadded activities in the US economy each stage of production adds significantly to the value of total output This means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatly magnified effect on overall economic activity The usage is not confined to chip production however An extensive range of other Californiabased industries from chemicals to textiles have intensive electricity usage in their production Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction in electricity And in fact real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input Ironically these interruptions could complement the Feds efforts to slow economic activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases What infuriates Californians might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us By John McAuley Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow Jones Company Inc Tel

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther AM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ Selling Power May Be Attractive To Pulp Paper Mills GMT December DJ Selling Power May Be Attractive To Pulp Paper Mills By Zahida Hafeez Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES CHICAGO Dow JonesAs power prices skyrocket in the Pacific northwest and forest products markets soften some pulp and paper producers could consider turning into power vendors taking downtime and instead reselling energy into the open market At least in theory many analysts believe that switching to selling power can be a more profitable enterprise for pulp and paper mills as it has been for some aluminum mills Nationwide pulp and paper makers generate roughly of their energy while is purchased from outside sources in some cases through fixed pricing arrangements And some even generate power enough to compete with public utilities for rank The worlds largest newsprint maker AbitibiConsolidated Inc ABY which ranks as the thirdlargest generator of power in the Canadian northwest region selfgenerates of its energy needs Of course not all companies could switch Firstly not all cogenerate a significant amount of their energy needs and those that do need to keep running their operations sidebyside Secondly the fixedrate contracts with public utilities bar customers from reselling power And lastly energy sale is strictly regulated in many parts of the US and Canada and hence not very profitable Mills which could profit from selling energy are those with fixed pricing arrangements for natural gas and electricity They could take downtime while reselling their energy at a higher price Alternatively they could adjust operations to run machines during nonpeak hours while selling electricity during the peak hours Meanwhile mills that have onsite hydroelectric power generators such as Abitibi and Pacifica Papers Inc TPPP can easily sell surplus energy or even close down operations and sell energy instead With wholesale power prices for dayahead delivery hovering in the mids a megawatt hour in the Pacific northwest region and hitting a megawatt hour just two weeks ago on speculation that extremely cold weather would boost demand to where it would exhaust supply it might not be a bad plan to consider shutting down Newsprint Makers Could Double Profits Rob Duncan analyst with Research Capital Corp in Toronto estimates that those paper companies which are now making a profit of to per ton of newsprint for instance could double their profits They could be making a profit of a ton of newsprint capacity closed if they were to sell electricity even at a rate of a megawatt hour Nevertheless Duncan added My feeling is that companies havent thought this through yet Indeed most companies are in the process of evaluating whether or not energy selling would suit their longterm goals and allow them to meet customer needs including Abitibi Bowater Inc BOW Weyerhaeuser Co WY and Domtar Inc DTC Most producers interviewed by the Dow Jones Newswires declined to say how much power they generated Were examining all of our alternatives at this point and first and foremost whether it makes sense to make paper at current energy rates or more sense to shut down said Abitibis spokesman John Chimienti adding but at this point there arent imminent closures The alternatives the company is considering now extend to deals with the respective public utilities to participate in some kind of loadshedding plan or shutting down in the winter months for better rates in the future Chimienti said Abitibi has resold some of its purchased energy in the past but never its hydroelectric power with most of its mills which are selfsufficient being located in regulated power markets officials said During this summers energy price spike Abitibi closed for a day or two a mill in Augusta Georgia and resold its contracted power according to Michael Innes vice president of energy and environment at Abitibi Reselling power seemed like a more profitable prospect at the mill which has the capability to produce tons of newsprint annually Innes said As to whether the company could do it again Innes said Weve never done it in the winter but that doesnt mean we cant ever do it Paul Ehinger an independent analyst based in Medford Ore said several plywood plants in the Northwest region which purchase natural gas at previously fixed lower rates have closed down and are reselling natural gas at a higher price than they paid US natural gas prices on the benchmark New York Mercantile Exchange have soared steadily since midFebruary from around per million British thermal units to an alltime high near this month four times levels The markets are poor and if you can make more money by shutting down operations and reselling natural gas bought at a firm price you should do it Ehinger said However the practice remains largely restricted We havent seriously considered this conceptbut it would depend on whether the cost of power keeps rising said Bob Boschee mill manager for SmurfitStone Container Corps SSCC mill in Missoula Mont which is currently running at only operating rate on electricity bought at fixed rates from Enron Corp ENE Everything becomes a consideration if power sells for a megawatt hour as it did a week or two ago Im sure everybody thought of

NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MWD analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California

retained generation and power purchase contracts rather than through a bidding process Commissioners will take a final vote on the ruling Dec but the three Democrats on the fivemember commission including Wood usually agree on proposed rulings before the rulings are put on the voting agenda which was posted Tuesday The change is in line with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions proposed ruling Nov which will get a final vote Friday to remove the mandate that the utilities buy their power from the statechartered California Power Exchange The PX has been a lynchpin of the

AM To Pergher Gunther Subject CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt FYI if you missed this it is what I was able to find out about the ISO constraining down of PX prices as of late Monday It seems to me like the ISO staff is opposed to the implementing the softcap that Winter got the FERC to approve on an emergency basis CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones

JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe Bonneville Power Administration which manages the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest US may not have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and spring a spokesman said Monday The way its shaping up now we are very concerned Weve had one of the driest Novembers on record and a very dry December said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion for fish in the river we have some concerns for later on this winter for power and for fish flows this April Hansen said Due to the strains on the system Bonneville has told the California Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are otherwise imminent Thursday Bonneville rushed to Californias rescue only after the ISO declared its firstever Stage emergency and blackouts were avoided Water in the federal systems main storage reservoir Coulee dam is at feet The maximum capacity of the reservoir is feet and the project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to feet Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty the normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of December Grand Coulee storage has fallen feet since Nov during a time when it is normally rising Whats more every gallon of water that rushes through the systems turbines generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than from lower ones so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesnt mean we wont be able to meet our obligations for fish flow But it presents a riskier operation Everytime you draw them down and combine them with cold weather the probability of meeting those flow requirements drops Hansen said Normally Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California utilities during the fall However Californias economic boom has raised electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual importer Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the coming spring snow melt We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this point Hansen said If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their customers demand for electric heating Bonneville will step in to avoid blackouts But each time that happens in the early part of the heating season it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in February or March Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals avoiding floods trying to improve fish populations recreation and power which has the lowest priority except in an electric supply emergency The hydropower operator is pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary obligations On a fivealarm scale We run at about twoandahalf alarm averaged over the year If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says well be in a four andahalf or five real quick Berry said Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and the California Under its federal tariff it cannot ask for more than a megawatthour from the ISO for example though the ISO usually offers MWh But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to MWh Friday in the Northwest and they have been running above MWh for more than a week Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market levels in a couple of months because it is being forced to rescue California so frequently now The difference could mean a hundredsofmilliondollar federal subsidy for California even though Bonnevilles priority obligation is to Northwest utilities according to its federal charter As a result Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under exchange deals whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at some later time Those deals could

power from Powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state highranking market sources familiar with the ISOs operation told Dow Jones Newswires But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day The ISO wouldnt comment on the transactions saying it is sensitive market information But sources said Powerex a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about a megawatthour from the early afternoon through the evening But that still wasnt enough juice The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of MWh The LADWP which is not governed by the ISO needs megawatts of power to serve its customers It is free sell power instate above the MWh price cap The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high However the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration which sells hydropower at cheap rates back into the market at prices times higher Powerex officials wouldnt comment on the ISO power sale saying all transactions are proprietary But the company also sold the ISO megawatts Tuesday minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts for a megawatthour market sources said The ISO whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost started the day with a stagetwo power emergency which means its operating reserves fell to less than The ISO is having to compete with investorowned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps The ISO warned federal regulators generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stagethree power emergency Wednesday but wouldnt order rolling blackouts A stage three is declared when the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources In order to line up more power we have to be in a dire situation Dorinson said Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison Sempra Energy unit SRE San Diego Gas Electric PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and several municipal

November PM To Pergher Gunther Subject FYI two articles from Tuesday in case you missed them FERC Unclear On Pay For MustRun Units Capital Return By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is working on its final order to fix Californias broken electricity market isnt clear on how the new rules will price power from mustrun generators or how generators will be paid a return on their capital investments a FERC commissioner said Tuesday In its preliminary proposal Nov FERC said that Californias wholesale electricity market price could have a soft cap of a megawatthour but the state could purchase additional power at more than MWh if needed Suppliers would be paid the price at which they bid in their power would have to justify why their costs exceed MWh Further the FERC could lower the sales price upon review As reported Monday FERC commissioners likely will set the soft cap at MWh in the final ruling which is expected in the middle of December instead of the initially proposed MWh The FERC however still doesnt know how generators selling power above the cap will be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal generating costs When generators are paid only their marginal costs they have no money left to pay off fixed costs and go broke Fixedcost recovery as a percentage of per megawatthour sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates Inefficient peaking units that run only a couple hundred hours a year for example need to be paid very high prices per hour to cover fixed costs In addition the state has contracts with several independent power producers whose generators must run or at least be available to run all the time for system reliability Currently these resource mustrun units get paid the market clearing price but a clearing price of MWh wont cover the fixed costs of gasfired units at current prices for natural gas in California Were not clear on these issues and were seeking comments on them said the commissioner who spoke on the condition of anonymity Others in the industry are also skeptical about how the new soft cap will work I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Dynegy DYN Marketing Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky said Tuesday while attending a CalPX conference in New York City By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMTAPDJ GMT Cal PX Panel Building Forward Market Key To Power Woes By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesA panel of market economists assembled by the California Power Exchange debated Tuesday whether the CalPX should move from a singleprice auction for pricing electricity in the spot market to an asbid market which the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed The consensus however was that moving purchases out of the spot market into a forward market is more important to solving Californias electricity crisis and that if a forward market develops the pricing mechanism of the CalPX spot market wont be that important Dynegy favors an asbid market but its not a matter of religion for us Dynegy DYN Marketing and Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky told the economists If I could wave a magic wand and create a forward market for California I wouldnt get all excited about whether the spot market is singleprice or asbid Lednicky said Under its current singleprice auction the CalPX pays all suppliers the price for the last most expensive megawatt taken for a given hour the next day In the FERC proposed asbid market suppliers whose energy is taken would get paid only the price at which they offered to sell their electricity to the states three main utilities The economists agreed that California legislators and regulators erred gravely in prohibiting utilities from entering into longterm forward contracts with suppliers when they began to deregulate the industry in What were they thinking Were they thinking at all asked University of Maryland professor Peter Crampton Even though California utilities are no longer prohibited from participating in the spot market in general the California Public Utilities Commission still hasnt approved any forward market contracts put before them by utilities that have reached agreements with suppliers Lednicky said Crampton nevertheless thinks that keeping the singleprice auction would help promote a forward market Singleprice auctions are more volatile than asbid markets Crampton said and forward markets are used more when spot markets are more volatile In addition the singleprice mechanism should be kept because an asbid market is a disadvantage to smaller generators who would have to spend a lot of resources relative to their size constantly figuring out how to bid in their power Crampton said When asked Lednicky agreed that the FERC proposal which was issued Nov and will result in a final order around the middle of December isnt really an asbid market anyway FERC said that the clearing price could be capped at a megawatthour and that the CalPX could purchase additional power at more than MWh asbid but suppliers would have to justify their prices by documenting costs and the FERC could lower the sales price after the fact As reported Monday by Dow Jones Newswires FERC likely will set the soft cap at MWh instead of MWh in the final ruling Also FERC would have to decide how more expensive generating plants would be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal costs Investment recovery as a percentage of sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Lednicky said The panelists and other participants Tuesday seemed to agree that an asbid pricing mechanism probably wont lower prices that much over the long term but it may lower prices significantly in the short

OrderCommissioners By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will likely lower its proposed per megawatthour soft cap on Californias wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be reelected in one key lawmaker close to the electricity issue said And Davis is in meetings to replace the CalISO and CalPX with a new entity to manage the power grid and the states two wholesale power

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther PM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing GMT November DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther AM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ POWER POINTS Say Goodbye To Price Caps If Bush Wins GMT November DJ POWER POINTS Say Goodbye To Price Caps If Bush Wins By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesCommissioner Curt L Heberts remarks on the California power market this week offer a glimpse of how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may rule in the event George W Bush is elected president more aggressive pursuit of deregulation an end to electricity price caps less concern for the environment and an end to protecting utilities from their own bad business decisions Immediately and without Congressional approval the new president gets to appoint a new chairman of the FERC Bush hasnt said whom he would choose as FERC chairman and that of course wont be one of the first decisions he makes if elected But Hebert has consulted with the Republican nominee on electricity deregulation and FERC insiders say it is likely Hebert will be asked Also if voters elect Bush on Tuesday the majority of FERC commissioners could be Republicans by the end of at the latest The spot vacated by Commissioner Vicky Bailey earlier this year still needs to be filled That position will go to a Republican regardless of whether Bush or Vice President Al Gore triumphs Tuesday because neither party can have more than three members on the fivemember commission There are already three Democrats Chairman James J Hoecker and commissioners William Massey and Linda Breathitt Hoeckers term expired June this year but he was appointed to continue serving on an interim basis until the current Congress adjourns President Clinton is expected to make a recess appointment of Hoecker after the Congress finalizes the budget and adjourns sometime after the election The recess appointment and thus a Democratic majority at the FERC would run through the end of the congressional session If Bush wins and Clinton doesnt make a recess appointment Bush would be able to appoint two commissioners immediately though all appointments must be approved by Congress and the Republicans would have a majority at the FERC In the meantime Hebert as chairman could still set the tone of the commissions rulings even as a member of the minority party on the commission Regular commissioners have just a few staffers each while the rest of the FERC reports to the chairman The staff initiates proposed orders and the other commissioners vote in response Hoecker for example initiated last years aggressive order for the establishment of independent regional transmission organizations and then got other commissioners to support it In addition the chairman controls the FERC budget Its one thing to issue an order and another to get the money necessary to enforce it So how would the FERC rule under Hebert Hes been clear in his frequent dissents from rulings the past three years If it were up to me todays order would be much much different Hebert said Wednesday on California even though he voted in favor of the order Now is not the time for timidity Hebert is against the a megawatthour soft price cap for California and hes voted against every price cap previously I find the concept of price mitigation an offensive one he wrote Wednesday There is a direct correlation between lower price caps and higher consumer prices In his oral comments Hebert noted that price controls didnt work for the Nixon administration or the Carter administration and they arent working for the ClintonGore administration Existing price caps if Hebert got his way would be escalated by or every six months or so until they became irrelevant A rapidly escalating cap would propel market participants to take the necessary actions to increase supplies and reduce peak demand The FERC didnt order independent generators to pay refunds for highpriced summer power to Californias consumers and utilities because they didnt find evidence of collusion by generators They left open the possibility of ordering refunds if such evidence comes to light Hebert on the other hand said the FERC had no legal authority to order refunds from this summer and that the possibility of refunds in the future introduces more damaging uncertainty into Californias power industry He said he regretted that he couldnt order refunds and thus become the most popular person in San Diego but if you read between the lines he clearly thinks that PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX should have to pay the multibillion dollar bill for their own inattentiveness as he calls it Hebert applauded letting Californias utilities out from under the staterun markets and eliminating the singleprice auction or marketclearing price mechanism He also scolded California environmentalists in his spoken comments Wednesday though not in his written brief When he told California regulators that new power plants were being approved in Illinois six months after applications were made Hebert said he was told Well this isnt Illinois I understand the environmental concerns but to say youre not Illinois and thats not how we do things here because of the environment isnt going to get the job done Hebert said If the people of California dont understand that something needs to be done yesterday about getting new power plants built somebodys not telling them the truth In the end however Hebert conceded that the FERC has little authority to dictate to states how to run their procedures for permitting new power plants and the FERC has little influence on environmental policy Little has been said on whom Bush might appoint as head of the Environmental Protection Administration but the word in Houston for what thats worth is that Enron Corp ENE Chairman Kenneth Lay could well become secretary of the Energy Department if Bush is elected While Bush and Gore both advocate deregulation of the electric utility industry the Democrats on the FERC have in fact been very reluctant to trust free markets and force utilities to open up the grid In general Bushs response to the countrys energy crisis is to increase supply while Gore would cut demand through new energy technologies and resist increased use of fossil fuels The FERC EPA and DOE under a Bush administration would be a very different world for the electricity industry Tune in

Watchers This article was originally published Friday By Jessica Berthold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesMarket watchers and some California Independent System Operator board members voiced concerns about Thursdays ISO vote to impose hourly wholesale power price caps The votes opponents say the caps may inhibit forward trading and could affect the construction of new generation in the state They also say the vote should have waited until after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission releases its report on Californias electricity woes Wednesday The price caps effective Nov or as soon thereafter as possible will be set monthly and will vary based on ISO forecasted load monthly gas prices and unit efficiency The ISO will multiply the average closing price for natural gas over the last three days of NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts by a fixed measure of generation efficiency at various load levels For example if the ISOs forecasted load is the fixed efficiency rate of will be multiplied by the natural gas price say mmBTU to yield a rounded price cap of MWH Market sources who asked not to be named said that although the ISO filed a proposal with FERC Oct requiring utilities to boost forward market purchases the forward market was reacting negatively Friday to the price caps The ISO appeared to be encouraging forward contracts with its FERC filing but its latest vote is an about face traders said Traders are telling us they are pulling away from forward positions because they dont know whats going on said California Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo On Monday to Thursday we traded contracts and yesterday we traded Todays theres nothing Theres been one offer at per megawatt hour for five years and no one is touching it CalPX which operates the states dayahead and block forward market plans to file a formal response to the ISO proposal with FERC Market sources said CalPX wasnt in support of the proposal Market watchers also said that if California ever needs to buy power out of market those prices will be higher than the cap Over the summer the ISO spent a record million on lastminute outofstate power purchases last summer Those inflated outofmarket purchases are what drove the markets high prices this summer said one source close to the issue California wholesale electricity prices hit unprecedented levels last summer and customers in San Diegos fully deregulated market saw their bills triple as a result ISO board member Mike Florio who wrote the price cap proposal stressed that it was a temporary measure that would be terminated as soon as broader market reforms were in place This is a threetofour month proposal and not something we are going to deal with going into the peak period Florio said Generators suggested that capping the market might be a disincentive for those looking to build new generation in the state and that the ISO proposal was untimely given FERCs Nov release of a report on Californias electricity market problems The ISO said in its Oct filing that FERC needs to be that venue that the wholesale market deals with and we agree with that said Duke Energy DUK spokesman Tom Williams Several ISO members who voted against the proposal also cited FERCs Nov report as presenting a possible conflict What do I do if FERC comes out with an order contrary to the caps on Nov said ISO President Terry Winter who voted against the proposal Many board members didnt expect to vote on price caps at Thursdays meeting since a vote on broader market redesign proposals was postponed until November This is the wrong time to vote on this if we are not doing comprehensive market redesign today said board member Barbara Barkovich Consumer group The Utility Reform Network supported the proposal saying that action was needed to control the market immediately Proposal sponsor Florio is a member of TURN The ISO has the responsibility to deal with what it can without waiting for FERC FERC needs a signal that the ISO is serious said TURN president Nettie Hoge Hoge also said that she was wary of arguments that the building of generation will be stifled due to the caps because the caps are well within a reasonable level Its clear the market isnt functioning Hoge said Theres going to be lots of debate about going outside the market versus command and control I dont think the

Watchers This article was originally published Friday By Jessica Berthold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesMarket watchers and some California Independent System Operator board members voiced concerns about Thursdays ISO vote to impose hourly wholesale power price caps The votes opponents say the caps may inhibit forward trading and could affect the construction of new generation in the state They also say the vote should have waited until after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission releases its report on Californias electricity woes Wednesday The price caps effective Nov or as soon thereafter as possible will be set monthly and will vary based on ISO forecasted load monthly gas prices and unit efficiency The ISO will multiply the average closing price for natural gas over the last three days of NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts by a fixed measure of generation efficiency at various load levels For example if the ISOs forecasted load is the fixed efficiency rate of will be multiplied by the natural gas price say mmBTU to yield a rounded price cap of MWH Market sources who asked not to be named said that although the ISO filed a proposal with FERC Oct requiring utilities to boost forward market purchases the forward market was reacting negatively Friday to the price caps The ISO appeared to be encouraging forward contracts with its FERC filing but its latest vote is an about face traders said Traders are telling us they are pulling away from forward positions because they dont know whats going on said California Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo On Monday to Thursday we traded contracts and yesterday we traded Todays theres nothing Theres been one offer at per megawatt hour for five years and no one is touching it CalPX which operates the states dayahead and block forward market plans to file a formal response to the ISO proposal with FERC Market sources said CalPX wasnt in support of the proposal Market watchers also said that if California ever needs to buy power out of market those prices will be higher than the cap Over the summer the ISO spent a record million on lastminute outofstate power purchases last summer Those inflated outofmarket purchases are what drove the markets high prices this summer said one source close to the issue California wholesale electricity prices hit unprecedented levels last summer and customers in San Diegos fully deregulated market saw their bills triple as a result ISO board member Mike Florio who wrote the price cap proposal stressed that it was a temporary measure that would be terminated as soon as broader market reforms were in place This is a threetofour month proposal and not something we are going to deal with going into the peak period Florio said Generators suggested that capping the market might be a disincentive for those looking to build new generation in the state and that the ISO proposal was untimely given FERCs Nov release of a report on Californias electricity market problems The ISO said in its Oct filing that FERC needs to be that venue that the wholesale market deals with and we agree with that said Duke Energy DUK spokesman Tom Williams Several ISO members who voted against the proposal also cited FERCs Nov report as presenting a possible conflict What do I do if FERC comes out with an order contrary to the caps on Nov said ISO President Terry Winter who voted against the proposal Many board members didnt expect to vote on price caps at Thursdays meeting since a vote on broader market redesign proposals was postponed until November This is the wrong time to vote on this if we are not doing comprehensive market redesign today said board member Barbara Barkovich Consumer group The Utility Reform Network supported the proposal saying that action was needed to control the market immediately Proposal sponsor Florio is a member of TURN The ISO has the responsibility to deal with what it can without waiting for FERC FERC needs a signal that the ISO is serious said TURN president Nettie Hoge Hoge also said that she was wary of arguments that the building of generation will be stifled due to the caps because the caps are well within a reasonable level Its clear the market isnt functioning Hoge said Theres going to be lots of debate about going outside the market versus command and control I dont think the

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther AM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ POWER POINTS Say Goodbye To Price Caps If Bush Wins GMT November DJ POWER POINTS Say Goodbye To Price Caps If Bush Wins By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesCommissioner Curt L Heberts remarks on the California power market this week offer a glimpse of how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may rule in the event George W Bush is elected president more aggressive pursuit of deregulation an end to electricity price caps less concern for the environment and an end to protecting utilities from their own bad business decisions Immediately and without Congressional approval the new president gets to appoint a new chairman of the FERC Bush hasnt said whom he would choose as FERC chairman and that of course wont be one of the first decisions he makes if elected But Hebert has consulted with the Republican nominee on electricity deregulation and FERC insiders say it is likely Hebert will be asked Also if voters elect Bush on Tuesday the majority of FERC commissioners could be Republicans by the end of at the latest The spot vacated by Commissioner Vicky Bailey earlier this year still needs to be filled That position will go to a Republican regardless of whether Bush or Vice President Al Gore triumphs Tuesday because neither party can have more than three members on the fivemember commission There are already three Democrats Chairman James J Hoecker and commissioners William Massey and Linda Breathitt Hoeckers term expired June this year but he was appointed to continue serving on an interim basis until the current Congress adjourns President Clinton is expected to make a recess appointment of Hoecker after the Congress finalizes the budget and adjourns sometime after the election The recess appointment and thus a Democratic majority at the FERC would run through the end of the congressional session If Bush wins and Clinton doesnt make a recess appointment Bush would be able to appoint two commissioners immediately though all appointments must be approved by Congress and the Republicans would have a majority at the FERC In the meantime Hebert as chairman could still set the tone of the commissions rulings even as a member of the minority party on the commission Regular commissioners have just a few staffers each while the rest of the FERC reports to the chairman The staff initiates proposed orders and the other commissioners vote in response Hoecker for example initiated last years aggressive order for the establishment of independent regional transmission organizations and then got other commissioners to support it In addition the chairman controls the FERC budget Its one thing to issue an order and another to get the money necessary to enforce it So how would the FERC rule under Hebert Hes been clear in his frequent dissents from rulings the past three years If it were up to me todays order would be much much different Hebert said Wednesday on California even though he voted in favor of the order Now is not the time for timidity Hebert is against the a megawatthour soft price cap for California and hes voted against every price cap previously I find the concept of price mitigation an offensive one he wrote Wednesday There is a direct correlation between lower price caps and higher consumer prices In his oral comments Hebert noted that price controls didnt work for the Nixon administration or the Carter administration and they arent working for the ClintonGore administration Existing price caps if Hebert got his way would be escalated by or every six months or so until they became irrelevant A rapidly escalating cap would propel market participants to take the necessary actions to increase supplies and reduce peak demand The FERC didnt order independent generators to pay refunds for highpriced summer power to Californias consumers and utilities because they didnt find evidence of collusion by generators They left open the possibility of ordering refunds if such evidence comes to light Hebert on the other hand said the FERC had no legal authority to order refunds from this summer and that the possibility of refunds in the future introduces more damaging uncertainty into Californias power industry He said he regretted that he couldnt order refunds and thus become the most popular person in San Diego but if you read between the lines he clearly thinks that PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX should have to pay the multibillion dollar bill for their own inattentiveness as he calls it Hebert applauded letting Californias utilities out from under the staterun markets and eliminating the singleprice auction or marketclearing price mechanism He also scolded California environmentalists in his spoken comments Wednesday though not in his written brief When he told California regulators that new power plants were being approved in Illinois six months after applications were made Hebert said he was told Well this isnt Illinois I understand the environmental concerns but to say youre not Illinois and thats not how we do things here because of the environment isnt going to get the job done Hebert said If the people of California dont understand that something needs to be done yesterday about getting new power plants built somebodys not telling them the truth In the end however Hebert conceded that the FERC has little authority to dictate to states how to run their procedures for permitting new power plants and the FERC has little influence on environmental policy Little has been said on whom Bush might appoint as head of the Environmental Protection Administration but the word in Houston for what thats worth is that Enron Corp ENE Chairman Kenneth Lay could well become secretary of the Energy Department if Bush is elected While Bush and Gore both advocate deregulation of the electric utility industry the Democrats on the FERC have in fact been very reluctant to trust free markets and force utilities to open up the grid In general Bushs response to the countrys energy crisis is to increase supply while Gore would cut demand through new energy technologies and resist increased use of fossil fuels The FERC EPA and DOE under a Bush administration would be a very different world for the electricity industry Tune in

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther PM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing GMT November DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia

wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be

NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is working on its final order to fix Californias broken electricity market isnt clear on how the new rules will price power from mustrun generators or how generators will be paid a return on their capital investments a FERC commissioner said Tuesday In its preliminary proposal Nov FERC said that Californias wholesale electricity market price could have a soft cap of a megawatthour but the state could purchase additional power at more than MWh if needed Suppliers would be paid the price at which they bid in their power would have to justify why their costs exceed MWh Further the FERC could lower the sales price upon review As reported Monday FERC commissioners likely will set the soft cap at MWh in the final ruling which is expected in the middle of December instead of the initially proposed MWh The FERC however still doesnt know how generators selling power above the cap will be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal generating costs When generators are paid only their marginal costs they have no money left to pay off fixed costs and go broke Fixedcost recovery as a percentage of per megawatthour sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates Inefficient peaking units that run only a couple hundred hours a year for example need to be paid very high prices per hour to cover fixed costs In addition the state has contracts with several independent power producers whose generators must run or at least be available to run all the time for system reliability Currently these resource mustrun units get paid the market clearing price but a clearing price of MWh wont cover the fixed costs of gasfired units at current prices for natural gas in California Were not clear on these issues and were seeking comments on them said the commissioner who spoke on the condition of anonymity Others in the industry are also skeptical about how the new soft cap will work I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Dynegy DYN Marketing Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky said Tuesday while attending a CalPX conference in New York City By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMTAPDJ GMT Cal PX Panel Building Forward Market Key To Power Woes By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesA panel of market economists assembled by the California Power Exchange debated Tuesday whether the CalPX should move from a singleprice auction for pricing electricity in the spot market to an asbid market which the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed The consensus however was that moving purchases out of the spot market into a forward market is more important to solving Californias electricity crisis and that if a forward market develops the pricing mechanism of the CalPX spot market wont be that important Dynegy favors an asbid market but its not a matter of religion for us Dynegy DYN Marketing and Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky told the economists If I could wave a magic wand and create a forward market for California I wouldnt get all excited about whether the spot market is singleprice or asbid Lednicky said Under its current singleprice auction the CalPX pays all suppliers the price for the last most expensive megawatt taken for a given hour the next day In the FERC proposed asbid market suppliers whose energy is taken would get paid only the price at which they offered to sell their electricity to the states three main utilities The economists agreed that California legislators and regulators erred gravely in prohibiting utilities from entering into longterm forward contracts with suppliers when they began to deregulate the industry in What were they thinking Were they thinking at all asked University of Maryland professor Peter Crampton Even though California utilities are no longer prohibited from participating in the spot market in general the California Public Utilities Commission still hasnt approved any forward market contracts put before them by utilities that have reached agreements with suppliers Lednicky said Crampton nevertheless thinks that keeping the singleprice auction would help promote a forward market Singleprice auctions are more volatile than asbid markets Crampton said and forward markets are used more when spot markets are more volatile In addition the singleprice mechanism should be kept because an asbid market is a disadvantage to smaller generators who would have to spend a lot of resources relative to their size constantly figuring out how to bid in their power Crampton said When asked Lednicky agreed that the FERC proposal which was issued Nov and will result in a final order around the middle of December isnt really an asbid market anyway FERC said that the clearing price could be capped at a megawatthour and that the CalPX could purchase additional power at more than MWh asbid but suppliers would have to justify their prices by documenting costs and the FERC could lower the sales price after the fact As reported Monday by Dow Jones Newswires FERC likely will set the soft cap at MWh instead of MWh in the final ruling Also FERC would have to decide how more expensive generating plants would be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal costs Investment recovery as a percentage of sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Lednicky said The panelists and other participants Tuesday seemed to agree that an asbid pricing mechanism probably wont lower prices that much over the long term but it may lower prices significantly in the short run They also agreed that the constant changing of market rules and the regulatory environment in California is a disincentive to investment in building new power plants in and around the state By

price cap rate of MWh The LADWP which is not governed by the ISO needs megawatts of power to serve its customers It is free sell power instate above the MWh price cap The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high However the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration which sells hydropower at cheap rates back into the market at prices times higher Powerex officials wouldnt comment on the ISO power sale saying all transactions are proprietary But the company also sold the ISO megawatts

pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps The ISO warned federal regulators generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stagethree power emergency Wednesday but wouldnt order rolling blackouts A stage three is declared when the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the

Risk DJ T ransalta Stops Pwr Sales To CalISO Questions Credit GMT December DJ Bonneville Elec Emergency Putting Water System At Risk This article was originally published Monday By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe Bonneville Power Administration which manages the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest US may not have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and spring a spokesman said Monday The way its shaping up now we are very concerned Weve had one of the driest Novembers on record and a very dry December said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion for fish in the river we have some concerns for later on this winter for power and for fish flows this April Hansen said Due to the strains on the system Bonneville has told the California Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are otherwise imminent Thursday Bonneville rushed to Californias rescue only after the ISO declared its firstever Stage emergency and blackouts were avoided Water in the federal systems main storage reservoir Coulee dam is at feet The maximum capacity of the reservoir is feet and the project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to feet Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty the normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of December Grand Coulee storage has fallen feet since Nov during a time when it is normally rising Whats more every gallon of water that rushes through the systems turbines generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than from lower ones so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesnt mean we wont be able to meet our obligations for fish flow But it presents a riskier operation Everytime you draw them down and combine them with cold weather the probability of meeting those flow requirements drops Hansen said Normally Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California utilities during the fall However Californias economic boom has raised electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual importer Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the coming spring snow melt We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this point Hansen said If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their customers demand for electric heating Bonneville will step in to avoid blackouts But each time that happens in the early part of the heating season it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in February or March Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals avoiding floods trying to improve fish populations recreation and power which has the lowest priority except in an electric supply emergency The hydropower operator is pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary obligations On a fivealarm scale We run at about twoandahalf alarm averaged over the year If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says well be in a four andahalf or five real quick Berry said Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and the California Under its federal tariff it cannot ask for more than a megawatthour from the ISO for example though the ISO usually offers MWh But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to MWh Friday in the Northwest and they have been running above MWh for more than a week Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market levels in a couple of months because it is being forced to rescue California so frequently now The difference could mean a hundredsofmilliondollar federal subsidy for California even though Bonnevilles priority obligation is to Northwest utilities according to its federal charter As a result Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under exchange deals whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at some later time Those deals could make the ISOs already strained financial situation worse if power market prices continue to rise through the winter By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMT Copyright c Dow Jones

JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones Newswires END Dow

NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MWD analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California

originally published Tuesday NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Public Utilities Commission has proposed letting the states three investorowned utilities out of the requirement that they purchase their power through the California Power Exchange The proposed ruling written by Commissioner Carl Wood would direct jurisdictional utilities to serve their native load to the extent possible with their retained generation and power purchase contracts rather than through a bidding process Commissioners will take a final vote on the ruling Dec but the three Democrats on the fivemember commission including Wood usually agree on proposed rulings before the rulings are put on the voting agenda which was posted Tuesday The change is in line with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions proposed ruling Nov which will get a final vote Friday to remove the mandate that the utilities buy their power from the statechartered California Power Exchange The PX has been a lynchpin of the states electric utility deregulation passed in It was to be a clearing house for a multitude of bulk power producers and sellers and its market prices were to be passed on to remaining customers of the utilities after the deregulation transition to free markets But Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric Co which emerged from the transition period a year ago was passing on CalPX prices to

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther AM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ Selling Power May Be Attractive To Pulp Paper Mills GMT December DJ Selling Power May Be Attractive To Pulp Paper Mills By Zahida Hafeez Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES CHICAGO Dow JonesAs power prices skyrocket in the Pacific northwest and forest products markets soften some pulp and paper producers could consider turning into power vendors taking downtime and instead reselling energy into the open market At least in theory many analysts believe that switching to selling power can be a more profitable enterprise for pulp and paper mills as it has been for some aluminum mills Nationwide pulp and paper makers generate roughly of their energy while is purchased from outside sources in some cases through fixed pricing arrangements And some even generate power enough to compete with public utilities for rank The worlds largest newsprint maker AbitibiConsolidated Inc ABY which ranks as the thirdlargest generator of power in the Canadian northwest region selfgenerates of its energy needs Of course not all companies could switch Firstly not all cogenerate a significant amount of their energy needs and those that do need to keep running their operations sidebyside Secondly the fixedrate contracts with public utilities bar customers from reselling power And lastly energy sale is strictly regulated in many parts of the US and Canada and hence not very profitable Mills which could profit from selling energy are those with fixed pricing arrangements for natural gas and electricity They could take downtime while reselling their energy at a higher price Alternatively they could adjust operations to run machines during nonpeak hours while selling electricity during the peak hours Meanwhile mills that have onsite hydroelectric power generators such as Abitibi and Pacifica Papers Inc TPPP can easily sell surplus energy or even close down operations and sell energy instead With wholesale power prices for dayahead delivery hovering in the mids a megawatt hour in the Pacific northwest region and hitting a megawatt hour just two weeks ago on speculation that extremely cold weather would boost demand to where it would exhaust supply it might not be a bad plan to consider shutting down Newsprint Makers Could Double Profits Rob Duncan analyst with Research Capital Corp in Toronto estimates that those paper companies which are now making a profit of to per ton of newsprint for instance could double their profits They could be making a profit of a ton of newsprint capacity closed if they were to sell electricity even at a rate of a megawatt hour Nevertheless Duncan added My feeling is that companies havent thought this through yet Indeed most companies are in the process of evaluating whether or not energy selling would suit their longterm goals and allow them to meet customer needs including Abitibi Bowater Inc BOW Weyerhaeuser Co WY and Domtar Inc DTC Most producers interviewed by the Dow Jones Newswires declined to say how much power they generated Were examining all of our alternatives at this point and first and foremost whether it makes sense to make paper at current energy rates or more sense to shut down said Abitibis spokesman John Chimienti adding but at this point there arent imminent closures The alternatives the company is considering now extend to deals with the respective public utilities to participate in some kind of loadshedding plan or shutting down in the winter months for better rates in the future Chimienti said Abitibi has resold some of its purchased energy in the past but never its hydroelectric power with most of its mills which are selfsufficient being located in regulated power markets officials said During this summers energy price spike Abitibi closed for a day or two a mill in Augusta Georgia and resold its contracted power according to Michael Innes vice president of energy and environment at Abitibi Reselling power seemed like a more profitable prospect at the mill which has the capability to produce tons of newsprint annually Innes said As to whether the company could do it again Innes said Weve never done it in the winter but that doesnt mean we cant ever do it Paul Ehinger an independent analyst based in Medford Ore said several plywood plants in the Northwest region which purchase natural gas at previously fixed lower rates have closed down and are reselling natural gas at a higher price than they paid US natural gas prices on the benchmark New York Mercantile Exchange have soared steadily since midFebruary from around per million British thermal units to an alltime high near this month four times levels The markets are poor and if you can make more money by shutting down operations and reselling natural gas bought at a firm price you should do it Ehinger said However the practice remains largely restricted We havent seriously considered this conceptbut it would depend on whether the cost of power keeps rising said Bob Boschee mill manager for SmurfitStone Container Corps SSCC mill in Missoula Mont which is currently running at only operating rate on electricity bought at fixed rates from Enron Corp ENE Everything becomes a consideration if power sells for a megawatt hour as it did a week or two ago Im sure everybody thought of

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther AM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ Selling Power May Be Attractive To Pulp Paper Mills GMT December DJ Selling Power May Be Attractive To Pulp Paper Mills By Zahida Hafeez Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES CHICAGO Dow JonesAs power prices skyrocket in the Pacific northwest and forest products markets soften some pulp and paper producers could consider turning into power vendors taking downtime and instead reselling energy into the open market At least in theory many analysts believe that switching to selling power can be a more profitable enterprise for pulp and paper mills as it has been for some aluminum mills Nationwide pulp and paper makers generate roughly of their energy while is purchased from outside sources in some cases through fixed pricing arrangements And some even generate power enough to compete with public utilities for rank The worlds largest newsprint maker AbitibiConsolidated Inc ABY which ranks as the thirdlargest generator of power in the Canadian northwest region selfgenerates of its energy needs Of course not all companies could switch Firstly not all cogenerate a significant amount of their energy needs and those that do need to keep running their operations sidebyside Secondly the fixedrate contracts with public utilities bar customers from reselling power And lastly energy sale is strictly regulated in many parts of the US and Canada and hence not very profitable Mills which could profit from selling energy are those with fixed pricing arrangements for natural gas and electricity They could take downtime while reselling their energy at a higher price Alternatively they could adjust operations to run machines during nonpeak hours while selling electricity during the peak hours Meanwhile mills that have onsite hydroelectric power generators such as Abitibi and Pacifica Papers Inc TPPP can easily sell surplus energy or even close down operations and sell energy instead With wholesale power prices for dayahead delivery hovering in the mids a megawatt hour in the Pacific northwest region and hitting a megawatt hour just two weeks ago on speculation that extremely cold weather would boost demand to where it would exhaust supply it might not be a bad plan to consider shutting down Newsprint Makers Could Double Profits Rob Duncan analyst with Research Capital Corp in Toronto estimates that those paper companies which are now making a profit of to per ton of newsprint for instance could double their profits They could be making a profit of a ton of newsprint capacity closed if they were to sell electricity even at a rate of a megawatt hour Nevertheless Duncan added My feeling is that companies havent thought this through yet Indeed most companies are in the process of evaluating whether or not energy selling would suit their longterm goals and allow them to meet customer needs including Abitibi Bowater Inc BOW Weyerhaeuser Co WY and Domtar Inc DTC Most producers interviewed by the Dow Jones Newswires declined to say how much power they generated Were examining all of our alternatives at this point and first and foremost whether it makes sense to make paper at current energy rates or more sense to shut down said Abitibis spokesman John Chimienti adding but at this point there arent imminent closures The alternatives the company is considering now extend to deals with the respective public utilities to participate in some kind of loadshedding plan or shutting down in the winter months for better rates in the future Chimienti said Abitibi has resold some of its purchased energy in the past but never its hydroelectric power with most of its mills which are selfsufficient being located in regulated power markets officials said During this summers energy price spike Abitibi closed for a day or two a mill in Augusta Georgia and resold its contracted power according to Michael Innes vice president of energy and environment at Abitibi Reselling power seemed like a more profitable prospect at the mill which has the capability to produce tons of newsprint annually Innes said As to whether the company could do it again Innes said Weve never done it in the winter but that doesnt mean we cant ever do it Paul Ehinger an independent analyst based in Medford Ore said several plywood plants in the Northwest region which purchase natural gas at previously fixed lower rates have closed down and are reselling natural gas at a higher price than they paid US natural gas prices on the benchmark New York Mercantile Exchange have soared steadily since midFebruary from around per million British thermal units to an alltime high near this month four times levels The markets are poor and if you can make more money by shutting down operations and reselling natural gas bought at a firm price you should do it Ehinger said However the practice remains largely restricted We havent seriously considered this conceptbut it would depend on whether the cost of power keeps rising said Bob Boschee mill manager for SmurfitStone Container Corps SSCC mill in Missoula Mont which is currently running at only operating rate on electricity bought at fixed rates from Enron Corp ENE Everything becomes a consideration if power sells for a megawatt hour as it did a week or two ago Im sure everybody thought of

NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MWD analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California

originally published Tuesday NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Public Utilities Commission has proposed letting the states three investorowned utilities out of the requirement that they purchase their

retained generation and power purchase contracts rather than through a bidding process Commissioners will take a final vote on the ruling Dec but the three Democrats on the fivemember commission including Wood usually agree on proposed rulings before the rulings are put on the voting agenda which was posted Tuesday The change is in line with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions proposed ruling Nov which will get a final vote Friday to remove the mandate that the utilities buy their power from the statechartered California Power Exchange The PX has been a lynchpin of the

AM To Pergher Gunther Subject CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt FYI if you missed this it is what I was able to find out about the ISO constraining down of PX prices as of late Monday It seems to me like the ISO staff is opposed to the implementing the softcap that Winter got the FERC to approve on an emergency basis CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones

JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe Bonneville Power Administration which manages the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest US may not have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and spring a spokesman said Monday The way its shaping up now we are very concerned Weve had one of the driest Novembers on record and a very dry December said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion for fish in the river we have some concerns for later on this winter for power and for fish flows this April Hansen said Due to the strains on the system Bonneville has told the California Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are otherwise imminent Thursday Bonneville rushed to Californias rescue only after the ISO declared its firstever Stage emergency and blackouts were avoided Water in the federal systems main storage reservoir Coulee dam is at feet The maximum capacity of the reservoir is feet and the project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to feet Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty the normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of December Grand Coulee storage has fallen feet since Nov during a time when it is normally rising Whats more every gallon of water that rushes through the systems turbines generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than from lower ones so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesnt mean we wont be able to meet our obligations for fish flow But it presents a riskier operation Everytime you draw them down and combine them with cold weather the probability of meeting those flow requirements drops Hansen said Normally Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California utilities during the fall However Californias economic boom has raised electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual importer Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the coming spring snow melt We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this point Hansen said If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their customers demand for electric heating Bonneville will step in to avoid blackouts But each time that happens in the early part of the heating season it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in February or March Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals avoiding floods trying to improve fish populations recreation and power which has the lowest priority except in an electric supply emergency The hydropower operator is pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary obligations On a fivealarm scale We run at about twoandahalf alarm averaged over the year If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says well be in a four andahalf or five real quick Berry said Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and the California Under its federal tariff it cannot ask for more than a megawatthour from the ISO for example though the ISO usually offers MWh But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to MWh Friday in the Northwest and they have been running above MWh for more than a week Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market levels in a couple of months because it is being forced to rescue California so frequently now The difference could mean a hundredsofmilliondollar federal subsidy for California even though Bonnevilles priority obligation is to Northwest utilities according to its federal charter As a result Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under exchange deals whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at some later time Those deals could

plant is off line as is MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company million for polluting Wed be happy to put our units back provided we dont get sued for it Thomas said Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality districts authority As reported a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies but choose not to do so Dynegys El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc DYN said the PUC visited its MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening where two of the four units about MW worth were off line Wednesday I guess our position is Gee were sorry you dont believe us but if you need to come and take a look for yourself thats fine said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired Weve been doing all we can to get back in service Lednicky said We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegys explanation of why its units were off line By

NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesThe US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is working on its final order to fix Californias broken electricity market isnt clear on how the new rules will price power from mustrun generators or how generators will be paid a return on their capital investments a FERC commissioner said Tuesday In its preliminary proposal Nov FERC said that Californias wholesale electricity market price could have a soft cap of a megawatthour but the state could purchase additional power at more than MWh if needed Suppliers would be paid the price at which they bid in their power would have to justify why their costs exceed MWh Further the FERC could lower the sales price upon review As reported Monday FERC commissioners likely will set the soft cap at MWh in the final ruling which is expected in the middle of December instead of the initially proposed MWh The FERC however still doesnt know how generators selling power above the cap will be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal generating costs When generators are paid only their marginal costs they have no money left to pay off fixed costs and go broke Fixedcost recovery as a percentage of per megawatthour sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates Inefficient peaking units that run only a couple hundred hours a year for example need to be paid very high prices per hour to cover fixed costs In addition the state has contracts with several independent power producers whose generators must run or at least be available to run all the time for system reliability Currently these resource mustrun units get paid the market clearing price but a clearing price of MWh wont cover the fixed costs of gasfired units at current prices for natural gas in California Were not clear on these issues and were seeking comments on them said the commissioner who spoke on the condition of anonymity Others in the industry are also skeptical about how the new soft cap will work I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Dynegy DYN Marketing Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky said Tuesday while attending a CalPX conference in New York City By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMTAPDJ GMT Cal PX Panel Building Forward Market Key To Power Woes By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesA panel of market economists assembled by the California Power Exchange debated Tuesday whether the CalPX should move from a singleprice auction for pricing electricity in the spot market to an asbid market which the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed The consensus however was that moving purchases out of the spot market into a forward market is more important to solving Californias electricity crisis and that if a forward market develops the pricing mechanism of the CalPX spot market wont be that important Dynegy favors an asbid market but its not a matter of religion for us Dynegy DYN Marketing and Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky told the economists If I could wave a magic wand and create a forward market for California I wouldnt get all excited about whether the spot market is singleprice or asbid Lednicky said Under its current singleprice auction the CalPX pays all suppliers the price for the last most expensive megawatt taken for a given hour the next day In the FERC proposed asbid market suppliers whose energy is taken would get paid only the price at which they offered to sell their electricity to the states three main utilities The economists agreed that California legislators and regulators erred gravely in prohibiting utilities from entering into longterm forward contracts with suppliers when they began to deregulate the industry in What were they thinking Were they thinking at all asked University of Maryland professor Peter Crampton Even though California utilities are no longer prohibited from participating in the spot market in general the California Public Utilities Commission still hasnt approved any forward market contracts put before them by utilities that have reached agreements with suppliers Lednicky said Crampton nevertheless thinks that keeping the singleprice auction would help promote a forward market Singleprice auctions are more volatile than asbid markets Crampton said and forward markets are used more when spot markets are more volatile In addition the singleprice mechanism should be kept because an asbid market is a disadvantage to smaller generators who would have to spend a lot of resources relative to their size constantly figuring out how to bid in their power Crampton said When asked Lednicky agreed that the FERC proposal which was issued Nov and will result in a final order around the middle of December isnt really an asbid market anyway FERC said that the clearing price could be capped at a megawatthour and that the CalPX could purchase additional power at more than MWh asbid but suppliers would have to justify their prices by documenting costs and the FERC could lower the sales price after the fact As reported Monday by Dow Jones Newswires FERC likely will set the soft cap at MWh instead of MWh in the final ruling Also FERC would have to decide how more expensive generating plants would be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal costs Investment recovery as a percentage of sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Lednicky said The panelists and other participants Tuesday seemed to agree that an asbid pricing mechanism probably wont lower prices that much over the long term but it may lower prices significantly in the short run They also agreed that the constant changing of market rules and the regulatory environment in California is a disincentive to investment in building new power plants in and around the state By

OrderCommissioners By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will likely lower its proposed per megawatthour soft cap on Californias wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be reelected in one key lawmaker close to the electricity issue said And Davis is in meetings to replace the CalISO and CalPX with a new entity to manage the power grid and the states two wholesale power

looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires

Trade Resources Corp From Pergher Gunther AM To undisclosedrecipients cc Subject DJ POWER POINTS Say Goodbye To Price Caps If Bush Wins GMT November DJ POWER POINTS Say Goodbye To Price Caps If Bush Wins By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesCommissioner Curt L Heberts remarks on the California power market this week offer a glimpse of how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may rule in the event George W Bush is elected president more aggressive pursuit of deregulation an end to electricity price caps less concern for the environment and an end to protecting utilities from their own bad business decisions Immediately and without Congressional approval the new president gets to appoint a new chairman of the FERC Bush hasnt said whom he would choose as FERC chairman and that of course wont be one of the first decisions he makes if elected But Hebert has consulted with the Republican nominee on electricity deregulation and FERC insiders say it is likely Hebert will be asked Also if voters elect Bush on Tuesday the majority of FERC commissioners could be Republicans by the end of at the latest The spot vacated by Commissioner Vicky Bailey earlier this year still needs to be filled That position will go to a Republican regardless of whether Bush or Vice President Al Gore triumphs Tuesday because neither party can have more than three members on the fivemember commission There are already three Democrats Chairman James J Hoecker and commissioners William Massey and Linda Breathitt Hoeckers term expired June this year but he was appointed to continue serving on an interim basis until the current Congress adjourns President Clinton is expected to make a recess appointment of Hoecker after the Congress finalizes the budget and adjourns sometime after the election The recess appointment and thus a Democratic majority at the FERC would run through the end of the congressional session If Bush wins and Clinton doesnt make a recess appointment Bush would be able to appoint two commissioners immediately though all appointments must be approved by Congress and the Republicans would have a majority at the FERC In the meantime Hebert as chairman could still set the tone of the commissions rulings even as a member of the minority party on the commission Regular commissioners have just a few staffers each while the rest of the FERC reports to the chairman The staff initiates proposed orders and the other commissioners vote in response Hoecker for example initiated last years aggressive order for the establishment of independent regional transmission organizations and then got other commissioners to support it In addition the chairman controls the FERC budget Its one thing to issue an order and another to get the money necessary to enforce it So how would the FERC rule under Hebert Hes been clear in his frequent dissents from rulings the past three years If it were up to me todays order would be much much different Hebert said Wednesday on California even though he voted in favor of the order Now is not the time for timidity Hebert is against the a megawatthour soft price cap for California and hes voted against every price cap previously I find the concept of price mitigation an offensive one he wrote Wednesday There is a direct correlation between lower price caps and higher consumer prices In his oral comments Hebert noted that price controls didnt work for the Nixon administration or the Carter administration and they arent working for the ClintonGore administration Existing price caps if Hebert got his way would be escalated by or every six months or so until they became irrelevant A rapidly escalating cap would propel market participants to take the necessary actions to increase supplies and reduce peak demand The FERC didnt order independent generators to pay refunds for highpriced summer power to Californias consumers and utilities because they didnt find evidence of collusion by generators They left open the possibility of ordering refunds if such evidence comes to light Hebert on the other hand said the FERC had no legal authority to order refunds from this summer and that the possibility of refunds in the future introduces more damaging uncertainty into Californias power industry He said he regretted that he couldnt order refunds and thus become the most popular person in San Diego but if you read between the lines he clearly thinks that PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX should have to pay the multibillion dollar bill for their own inattentiveness as he calls it Hebert applauded letting Californias utilities out from under the staterun markets and eliminating the singleprice auction or marketclearing price mechanism He also scolded California environmentalists in his spoken comments Wednesday though not in his written brief When he told California regulators that new power plants were being approved in Illinois six months after applications were made Hebert said he was told Well this isnt Illinois I understand the environmental concerns but to say youre not Illinois and thats not how we do things here because of the environment isnt going to get the job done Hebert said If the people of California dont understand that something needs to be done yesterday about getting new power plants built somebodys not telling them the truth In the end however Hebert conceded that the FERC has little authority to dictate to states how to run their procedures for permitting new power plants and the FERC has little influence on environmental policy Little has been said on whom Bush might appoint as head of the Environmental Protection Administration but the word in Houston for what thats worth is that Enron Corp ENE Chairman Kenneth Lay could well become secretary of the Energy Department if Bush is elected While Bush and Gore both advocate deregulation of the electric utility industry the Democrats on the FERC have in fact been very reluctant to trust free markets and force utilities to open up the grid In general Bushs response to the countrys energy crisis is to increase supply while Gore would cut demand through new energy technologies and resist increased use of fossil fuels The FERC EPA and DOE under a Bush administration would be a very different world for the electricity industry Tune in

Watchers This article was originally published Friday By Jessica Berthold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesMarket watchers and some California Independent System Operator board members voiced concerns about Thursdays ISO vote to impose hourly wholesale power price caps The votes opponents say the caps may inhibit forward trading and could affect the construction of new generation in the state They also say the vote should have waited until after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission releases its report on Californias electricity woes Wednesday The price caps effective Nov or as soon thereafter as possible will be set monthly and will vary based on ISO forecasted load monthly gas prices and unit efficiency The ISO will multiply the average closing price for natural gas over the last three days of NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts by a fixed measure of generation efficiency at various load levels For example if the ISOs forecasted load is the fixed efficiency rate of will be multiplied by the natural gas price say mmBTU to yield a rounded price cap of MWH Market sources who asked not to be named said that although the ISO filed a proposal with FERC Oct requiring utilities to boost forward market purchases the forward market was reacting negatively Friday to the price caps The ISO appeared to be encouraging forward contracts with its FERC filing but its latest vote is an about face traders said Traders are telling us they are pulling away from forward positions because they dont know whats going on said California Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo On Monday to Thursday we traded contracts and yesterday we traded Todays theres nothing Theres been one offer at per megawatt hour for five years and no one is touching it CalPX which operates the states dayahead and block forward market plans to file a formal response to the ISO proposal with FERC Market sources said CalPX wasnt in support of the proposal Market watchers also said that if California ever needs to buy power out of market those prices will be higher than the cap Over the summer the ISO spent a record million on lastminute outofstate power purchases last summer Those inflated outofmarket purchases are what drove the markets high prices this summer said one source close to the issue California wholesale electricity prices hit unprecedented levels last summer and customers in San Diegos fully deregulated market saw their bills triple as a result ISO board member Mike Florio who wrote the price cap proposal stressed that it was a temporary measure that would be terminated as soon as broader market reforms were in place This is a threetofour month proposal and not something we are going to deal with going into the peak period Florio said Generators suggested that capping the market might be a disincentive for those looking to build new generation in the state and that the ISO proposal was untimely given FERCs Nov release of a report on Californias electricity market problems The ISO said in its Oct filing that FERC needs to be that venue that the wholesale market deals with and we agree with that said Duke Energy DUK spokesman Tom Williams Several ISO members who voted against the proposal also cited FERCs Nov report as presenting a possible conflict What do I do if FERC comes out with an order contrary to the caps on Nov said ISO President Terry Winter who voted against the proposal Many board members didnt expect to vote on price caps at Thursdays meeting since a vote on broader market redesign proposals was postponed until November This is the wrong time to vote on this if we are not doing comprehensive market redesign today said board member Barbara Barkovich Consumer group The Utility Reform Network supported the proposal saying that action was needed to control the market immediately Proposal sponsor Florio is a member of TURN The ISO has the responsibility to deal with what it can without waiting for FERC FERC needs a signal that the ISO is serious said TURN president Nettie Hoge Hoge also said that she was wary of arguments that the building of generation will be stifled due to the caps because the caps are well within a reasonable level Its clear the market isnt functioning Hoge said Theres going to be lots of debate about going outside the market versus command and control I dont think the

version of an item published Thursday NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias two big utilities have said that having to buy power at market prices and deliver it to customers at regulated rates has cost them billion since May But more than of that money has been paid into accounts the utilities own because the utilities are still the biggest generators of electricity in the state Since California wholesale power prices began to rise in May Southern California Edison the regulated utility unit of Edison International EIX has paid the California Power Exchange billion more on electricity than SCE is allowed to collect from customers Through September however the CalPX has paid the utility about billion over its generating costs for electricity sold into the states wholesale power market SCEs Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci said Thursday in an interview Likewise in Northern California PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co through August paid the CalPX billion more for electricity than it could collect from its customers During that time however the CalPX paid PGE million over its generating costs for power the utility sold according to PGE spokesman Ron Low Loretta Lynch chairwoman of the California Public Utilities Commission and the Utility Reform Network a consumer group want the utilities to use those gains to offset some of their electricity purchase losses The utilities however say that the gains from their power plants arent profits as TURN calls them The money has gone to pay off socalled stranded assets debts left over from building nuclear power plants before deregulation and expensive longterm supply contracts the utility was forced to purchase in the s and is still paying for With income from its generators so high those debts have been paid off much earlier than expected and both utilities strandedasset accounts are now overcollected by hundreds of millions of dollars One of the major questions state regulators face is what to do with that money Utilities Say PowerSale Revenue Only Partial Solution SCE would support paying off the revenue shortfall with the asset overcollection only as part of an overall revision of deregulation that must include an end to the current rate freeze Scilacci said Beyond that the utility wants the CPUC to confirm that utilities will be permitted to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers according to a regulatory plea it made late Wednesday SCE has proposed a rate increase of up to for its customers and is seeking refunds from independent power producers and power trading companies which it says are charging illegally high prices Customers who leave the utility and start buying electricity from SCEs competitors in Southern California should also be forced to help pay off the debts incurred this year SCEs chief executive Stephen E Frank said in a press conference Thursday PGE says that using the asset overcollections to pay off the purchased power undercollections wont solve the problem completely Assuming that prices during the summer of are similar to those experience during the summer of the unrecovered balance in purchased power costs will grow to more than double its current level by the end of August PGE said in its own filing Wednesday Generation revenues from PGEs hydro and Diablo Canyon plants above costs would offset only about onequarter of the increase in the undercollection from the same period Under current regulations overcollection for stranded assets is to be refunded to customers Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric emerged a year ago from its transition to competitive markets and this August sent million in checks to its million customers SCE has assumed for the purposes of its own analysis that its strandedasset overcollection would go toward reducing rates going forward rather than to sending checks to customers as SDGE did By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones
