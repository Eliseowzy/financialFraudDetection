airshipblimp operations inside enhanced Class B airspace AOPA is continuing to push for the restoration of these flight operations Plans to open the remaining ECB areas are under way but no timelines have been established yet AOPA understands that security at the airports inside these ECB areas will be key to the return of VFR operations Friday afternoon senior AOPA staff attended a meeting on groundside security that may eventually play a role in the release of the second group of ECB areas Andrew V Cebula AOPA senior vice president of Government and Technical Affairs discussed with FAA security officials possible changes that would enable VFR operations in those areas We wont rest until the last VFR aircraft is flying said AOPA President Phil Boyer We know some things will change but our goal is to restore all general aviation operations to where we were before the attack while maintaining reasonable levels of security The full text of Saturday nights notam is below While this is an official FDC notam AOPA reminds pilots to check the latest notams prior to any flight operations In recent weeks some notams have been modified repeatedly or rescinded AOPA will continue to post
