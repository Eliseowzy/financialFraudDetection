Now add up the total number of points OVER POINTS Others see you as someone they should handle with care Youre seen as vain selfcentered and who is extremely dominant Others may admire you wishing they could be more like you but dont always trust you hesitating to become too deeply involved with you TO POINTS Others see you as an exciting highly volatile rather impulsive personality a natural leader whos quick to make decisions though not always the right ones They see you as bold and adventuresome someone who will try anything once someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement your radiate TO POINTS Others see you as fresh lively charming amusing practical and always interesting someone whos constantly in the center of attention but sufficiently wellbalanced not to let it go to their head They also see you as kind considerate and understanding someone wholl always cheer them up and help them out TO POINTS Others see you as sensible cautious careful practical They see you as clever gifted or talented but modest Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily but someone whos extremely loyal to friends you do

that trust is ever broken TO POINTS Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy They see you as very cautious extremely careful a slow and steady plodder Itd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then usually decide against it They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature UNDER POINTS People think you are shy nervous and indecisive someone who needs looking after who always wants someone else to make the decisions who doesnt want to get involved with anyone or anything They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that dont exist Some people think youre boring Only those who know you well know that you arent Now forward this to others and put your score in subject box
