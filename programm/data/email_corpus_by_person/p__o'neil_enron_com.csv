knowledgeable in the areas we are diving into However The point here is that you committed to take ownership of action items which came out of a meeting we had last week I was dialed in from Portland It was expressed in our meeting the importance of the information we are looking an a time frame we hoped to get it in Chris Stokley sent you a few message in followup to ensure that progress was occurring and you failed to respond to anyone letting them know that you would not be the point person spearheading those action items Until a week later We are now another week into this transition and still unable to deliver interval meter data to the business units requesting it If it takes CSC a week to make it available to us We could have had today or tomorrow Now it would be another week

RE FW CSC UPDATE Diann You should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved Based on the email below I lost one week by your not having this conversation w a CSC rep last week This is a week that we could not afford to lose Maurice Let me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item Also what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority I agree w you best scenario recommendation I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates bw the two process that you have laid out Thanks for your help on these items Ps When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these

ONeil Murray P Hart Vivian Carsten NRON Ha Kenny Richter Alma Subject RE FW CSC UPDATE Chris In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format MDEF would be very difficult because of how the system operates Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do but it has not been a high priority I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today we could have this set up next week The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority Maurice From Chris
