Original Message From Petrie James Sent Wednesday January AM To Zimmer Janet Bridges Mark Barrett Beth Halligan Laura Robinson Claudia Cc Eber Louis Subject RE ubswenergycom URGENT I sent revisions to the FAQs and the cover letter to Kal Shah and Leslie Hansen last night Kal assures me that all of the changes I suggested including the deletion of any mention of ubswenergy other than as part of a web address were being made Accordingly I think the message is getting through Also in conversations with Mark Taylor I stressed that no trademark registration was to be made pointing out that the use of the url was intended to be temporary Mark had not had anything to do with a possible registration of the mark other than receiving a phone mail message We will see how things go however I believe the message has gotten through for now Jim Original Message From Zimmer Janet Sent Wednesday January AM To Bridges Mark Barrett Beth Halligan Laura Robinson Claudia Cc Eber Louis Petrie James Subject RE ubswenergycom URGENT The broader issue perhaps is that they appear to be namingbranding the online trading system UBSWenergy and using that as a marketing name for their business For example I had heard they wanted to trademark the term Even if they have approval to use the website name temporarily does it make sense to go out with a marketing name that might be killed in months and for which we may not have approval to trademark Maybe not a popular position if Costas is behind this but we should be sure everyone is clear on the possible ramifications Just so you know there are some intellectual property considerations behind this In order to best protect the UBS and UBS Warburg names group does not like us to weaken them by using UBSW Janet Zimmer UBS Warburg Region Americas fax

JohnDevitofranceschi JarodJenson BobHillier Petrie James Russell Steve Subject ubswenergycom Changing authoritative servers It is crucial that the DNS servers for ubswenergycom be set as follows as soon as possible dnsextubswenergycom dnsextubswenergycom It is entirely possible that the names dnsextubswenergycom and dnsextubswenergycom will be rejected because the IP addresses associated with those names are already associated with dnsextenrononlinecom and dnsextenrononlinecom If this is the case it will be necessary to use the enrononlinecom domain names for the DNS servers and then change the server names later once ubswenergy is online and ready As long as the servers provide information about both domains this should be possible jd John Devitofranceschi perotsystems UBSW Unix
