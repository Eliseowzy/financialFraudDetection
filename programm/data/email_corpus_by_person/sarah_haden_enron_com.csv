businessman who had just lost an election for the Florida governorship Baur said he invested in Enron Liquids Pipeline on advice from his broker at Charles Schwab Corp not insider information about the future sale Why not this investment Baur said Any Joe Schmo citizen could have walked in off the street and requested to invest in Enron Liquid Pipelines Still Baur said that she expects Democrats to try to capitalize on Bushs investment in Enron Liquid Pipelines Admittedly anything with the word Enron in it is incendiary she said You could look at this backward and forward but the facts are

Enron in Aside from the two fundraisers the two men have had infrequent contact said Larry Pierce a spokesman for Kinders energy company The two men have run into each other occasionally at public events and they have never had any business relationship he added Kinder hosted these fundraisers as a favor to the Republican Party said Pierce What Democrats are doing nationally in trying to capitalize on the suffering of Enron employees for their own cheap political gain is absolutely shameful said Karen Unger the governors campaign manager She called it an act of sheer desperation by

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc CALGARY Dow Jones Development of Canadian Arctic natural gas gained points this week after producers in Alaska announced their competing pipeline projects could be too risky to pursue But analysts and producers caution that the temporary retreat by ExxonMobil Corp XOM BP PLC BP TBP UBP and Phillips Petroleum P TPLP from the very highrisk project doesnt change fundamental issues challenging the Canadian side of the Arctic fence If an Alaskan pipeline doesnt go there would be potential benefits for a Canadian line simply because huge volumes of Alaska gas four billion cubic feet a day wont hit the market Calgary analyst Ed Small acknowledged Friday But he added I just dont know if thats enough to make the Mackenzie Delta pipeline happen Industry estimates natural gas has to sell for at least US a million British thermal units to make a northern pipeline economically feasible And natural gas prices that tanked from USMMBtu in December to USMMBtu this week havent given encouraging signals to an increasingly tentative market However the fact that a growing demand for natural gas isnt projected to abate and immense untapped resources await in the north serve as favorable factors The advantage the Mackenzie Delta pipeline has is its smaller in incremental volumes than Alaska and in capital costs said Paul Mortensen from the Calgarybased Canadian Energy Research Institute The overland route from the Delta at the western tip of the Northwest Territories through Alberta and into the US is being considered by several producer groups the largest one formed by Imperial Oil Ltd IMO TIMO Shell Canada Ltd THSC ExxonMobil Canada XXOC and Conoco Canada Resources Ltd COCA COCB formerly Gulf Canada Resources Ltd A Mackenzie Valley pipeline would ship between million cubic feet of gas a day to billion cubic feet of gas a day to the US for several million dollars less than either proposed Alaska routes analysts say Capital Costs Massive The Imperial consortium hasnt released any cost estimates however the Alaska groups preliminary figures pin huge capital costs on both their proposed Arctic lines US billion to run Alaska gas through Prudhoe Bay down the Northwest Territories or US billion along the Alaska Highway through the Yukon Right here now today neither route is economic said ExxonMobils Robert Shilhab adding that the project hasnt been shelved Tolls to ship the Arctic gas down to the continental US were estimated at an eyebrowraising USUSMMBtu about US cents higher than monthahead contracts selling Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange Imperial Oil spokesman Hart Searle said the Mackenzie consortium wasnt so dependent on current pricing as it is on projections for when the pipeline would start flowing volumes around They are still optimistic prices will rebound but realize the massive project carries a certain amount of risk Typically investments that open new regions and new basins are not as economically robust as those that come after it Searle said The consortium still hopes to file a preliminary application for the pipeline by the end of this year he said Completing regulatory reviews are expected to take up to four years with another two to four years required on the physical construction By Dina OMeara Dow Jones Newswires Extremists target European gas pipelines Algerian threat ELIZABETH NASH in Madrid The Independent London FOREIGN Page Copyright Independent Newspapers UK Limited Algerian Islamists linked to Osama bin Laden have threatened to declare war on British and other vital Western interests by blowing up oil and gas pipelines that run from North Africa to Europe The threat follows the arrest last week in Spain of six members of Algerias extremist Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat SGPC after an MI tipoff for their role in a plot to blow up the US embassy in Paris The message sent to the Algerian media named France Germany Britain and Belgium as the European countries that persecute Islamists and cooperate with the US in their struggle against Bin Laden It was issued by Hassen Hatab who attended a recent meeting in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia with associates of Mr bin Laden The CIA filmed one of the hijackers who was on the plane that hit the Pentagon at the same meeting The Salafistas a dissident breakaway from the Armed Islamic Group backed by Mr Bin Ladens AlQaedah organisation appear on a US blacklist of groups suspected of taking part in the September attack A suicide strike at any point of the vast transcontinental pipeline would choke off a lifeline that fuels the economies of Spain Portugal Italy and France Spain has sharply increased its dependence on Algerian natural gas in recent years Britain would also feel the impact of such a terrorist attack Although the UK is still an exporter of gas from the North Sea it is expected to become a net importer within the next few years The organisation said it intended to attack the pipelines carrying liquid gas from Algeria to Spain via Morocco and to Italy via Tunisia alongside Algerias giant refineries on the Mediterranean ports of Arzew and Skikda The six Algerians arrested this week in Madrid were accused of planning to launch suicide attacks on US targets in Europe Spain is increasingly worried that the Algerian pipeline which enters Spain at Tarifa near Gibraltar may become one of the next big terrorist targets Originating in Algerias central Hassid Messaud region it has suddenly become a strategic flashpoint In the years since Algerias armed Islamic opposition has been active they have barely targeted oil and gas installations tacitly sharing the governments view that crucial emblems of national prosperity were untouchable But observers believe this truce will not hold if Washington launches an assault on Afghanistan Spain says that in the event of an attack it would import liquefied natural gas in special tankers from Russia And Brussels has been pondering for months how to guarantee the EUs expanding energy needs if oil imports are disrupted Sources in Spains oil sector reckon Algerias armed forces and intelligence services are on sufficiently high alert to keep the oil and gas flow secure as it provides the bulk of the countrys foreign currency earnings Depressed natural gas prices could hamper all Arctic gas development BY JAMES STEVENSON The Canadian Press Copyright c The Canadian Press All rights reserved CALGARY CP The same low natural gas prices that suggest its not economical to build a USbased pipeline accessing Alaskas large gas reserves could cause problems for a Canadian line tapping gas in the Northwest Territories Theres no doubt that northern gas is expensive Duncan Robertson managing partner of energy analysts SBM Inc said Friday So the economics have to be pretty rigorous to pursue any significant amount of activity whether thats drilling or facilities construction or transportation Robertson said he believes at least one northern gas pipeline will eventually be built to access the large reserves on Alaskas North Slope and the NWTs Mackenzie Delta but exactly when remains unclear because of slumping gas prices I dont believe this will eliminate northern gas pipelines but I do believe that the current commodity price trends which are downward have the potential to delay progress startup on these pipelines On Thursday several global oil giants looking at building a pipeline out of Alaska said a preliminary analysis showed the project would be too pricey At this point neither of the two routes were considering are economic but were working hard to reduce costs said Dave MacDowell spokesman for the Alaska Gas Producers Pipeline Team which represents industry heavyweights ExxonMobil BP and Phillips Petroleum MacDowell denied reports that the producers were shelving all pipeline plans Bottom line is were peddling as fast as we can Although the decision to build a pipeline eventually rests with the energy producers the whole debate has been steeped in fierce politics including Canadian and US leaders territorial heads and First Nations groups Thats because a pipeline connecting Arctic natural gas to American markets would be a massive project worth billions of dollars to the jurisdictions it passes through The preliminary study shows an Alaskan pipeline route would cost at least billion US Talk of building gas pipelines from both Alaska and the NWT heated up substantially at the start of the year when gas prices were hitting record highs of more than US per thousand cubic feet But a slumping economy left reeling after the Sept terrorist attacks on the United States and unprecedented natural gas supply has sent prices plummeting to onefifth of their January highs Prices continued to hover below per thousand cubic feet this week And predictions of another warm winter combined with warnings of an impending recession do not bode well for future prices In their preliminary analysis the Alaskan producers say a pipeline would yield a return on investment of to per cent instead of the desired per cent A separate group of energy producers is also studying the feasibility of accessing gas reserves in the Mackenzie Delta Hart Searle of Imperial Oil said this group still hopes to have a decision before the end of the year on whether it will proceed with plans to seek regulatory approval on a pipeline The producer group watches what goes on in the commodity markets and yes weve seen a pretty steep decline in natural gas prices says Searle But as we look at the economics for potential development like a Mackenzie Valley pipeline the economics arent dependent on todays prices but what prices will be in the longer term ie in the next to years And while the group has not officially released a cost estimate of a pipeline direct south from NWT to the existing network in Alberta Searle says Imperial hasnt taken exception to estimates of between billion and billion which would be vastly cheaper than the Alaskan pipeline route That puts a different face on your economics he said Other analysts say warnings from the Alaskan producers that they might not go ahead with their pipeline was a political cryforhelp to the US government which has been keen to increase domestic energy supplies TransCanada Pipelines one of Canadas biggest shippers of natural gas with possible involvement in both the Alaskan and Mackenzie Delta lines is also remaining positive that development will proceed TransCanada still believes that two northern pipeline systems independent from each other and serving the needs of each individual basin will increase the flexibility for natural gas producers and provide the highest overall value for stakeholders said spokesman Glenn Herchak INDIA Panel suggests Indian govt pay in Enron rowpaper Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Oct Reuters An Indian panel has suggested the federal government be willing to spend almost billion rupees billion to help resurrect the Enron Corp Dabhol power project which stopped producing electricity more than three months ago a business daily said on Monday The panel was constituted in early to review all aspects of the controversial power project set up at a cost of billion on the west coast of India The Business Standard daily said the panels report had suggested Dabhols various stakeholders all be willing to absorb the costs that would have to be incurred to revive the MW gasbased project Dabhol Power Company is percent owned by Enron Corp GE and Bechtel own percent each while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board a local stateowned power utility owns the remaining percent The western state of Maharashtra is a guarantor to the Dabhol project and the federal government is its counterguarantor USbased Enron has said it wants to exit the project after a bitter dispute with the local utility which had initially contracted to purchase all the power from Dabhol Power Companys plant It subsequently defaulted on payments saying it didnt need that much power which it claimed was too expensive in any case Enron claimed the utility was reneging on its contractual obligations Dabhol finally took the utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London warning India faces liabilities worth billion But Enron has simultaneously said it is willing to settle out of court if it can recover its costs While there have been many suggestions the panels report is among the few to provide a detailed solution including the liability each party would have to shoulder A SOLUTION The panel was set up by the Maharashtra government Its main brief was to suggest ways of reworking the power purchase agreement so as to reduce Dabhols tariff After the dispute worsened the panel was also asked to suggest revival measures The panel proposed that if all the stakeholders were willing to absorb the specified losses the tariff on Dabhols power could be reduced to between and rupees per kilowatthour from to rupees at percent capacity utilisation the newspaper reported According to the panels report the federal governments liability of billion rupees included an infusion of billion in cash waiving customs duties on the import of liquefied natural gas LNG and cutting import duties on capital goods the report said It said the panel has also suggested Enron GE and Bechtel together absorb a loss of billion rupees on their investment in the project rupees USA FEATUREWomen rise to power in deregulated energy industry By Carolyn Koo Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK Sept Reuters The phrase women in power has new meaning now given the changes in the utility industry The standardissue utility executive has invariably been male He had an engineering background all the better to deal with the capitalintensive business of power plants and he craved stability in an industry that eschewed risk relying on regulators to decree how much he could charge customers for power But changes wrought by deregulation have turned that profile on its head The way is now open for women often without engineering degrees and often with a large appetite for risk to reach the highest echelons of the industry When I left Wall Street in most of my peers and colleagues looked at me like I had blown a gasket Its like What are you thinking about said VJ VernaJean Horgan president of the energy trading unit of Dallasbased TXU Corp Since then there have been innumerable people from Wall Street who have made the transition to utilities Few women have made it to the top For the most part they entered the industry as it approached deregulation in the mids But freeing parts of the industry from the grip of government regulation has dramatically altered its landscape opened new lines of business and attracted people with diverse experiences USING NEW SKILLS Joan Freilich chief financial officer of Consolidated Edison Inc said utilities have a strong engineering orientation and since much work requires physical power there have been few women Seeking a challenge she joined the New Yorkbased utility long before deregulation in I think that up until very recently this has been an industry that hasnt had tremendous change Its been a very stable industry said Ruth Ann Gillis the first female chief financial officer of Chicagobased Exelon Corp Recruited by Leo Mullin then vice chairman of Exelons predecessor companies Unicom Corp and Commonwealth Edison and now chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines Gillis joined the power industry from the health industry in when Illinois was entering the throes of deregulation Deregulation permitted power companies to branch out into competitive businesses such as the trading and marketing of power which required new skills that utility executives generally didnt have Horgan is an example of an executive with those new skills After working for both Bankers Trust and Merrill Lynch she joined Consolidated Natural Gas now part of Dominion Resources six years ago from Wall Street My initial transition into the utility industry was in and that in large part was driven by the ability to apply a lot of the same skills that one applies in a Wall Street environment deal structuring strong commercial bent capital and commodity coming together she said Other women came from the technical side Marce Fuller president and chief executive of Atlantabased Mirant Corp had engineering degrees from the University of Alabama and New Yorks Union College and then moved into corporate finance That was at a time when a lot of other people were saying I cant believe youre going to do this she said I didnt have any training but I wanted to learn that part of the business and felt very strongly about making that move and it was absolutely the right thing for me to do MORE DIVERSITY EXPECTED Women executives said as management becomes more accepting more women will follow in their footsteps It helps that most utilities have at least one female director though few have more than one according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuarts Utility Board Index study for Currently percent of utilities included in the study have at least one female board member about normal for companies that make up the top publicly traded firms Con Ed bucks the trend with four women including Freilich on a board of directors And for all the men who hold positions of power the industry seems to suffer from little sexual discrimination on an official basis anyway The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said there were sexbased charges including sexual harassment filed across all industries in fiscal year The utility sector comprised less than percent of that total One of the reasons we dont have more diversity is that people are most comfortable with people like themselves said Freilich When I first came to Con Ed men were managers But that is slowly changing Over time when the opportunities in utilities are better understood youre going to see by definition more women more AfricanAmericans more HispanicAmericans AsianAmericans who will be recruited to be part of the leadership of the companies that today may not be as diverse Gillis said Many of these women are doing what they can to help their female colleagues That impulse may stem partly from the legacy of support of the allwomens college which Freilich Barnard College Gillis Smith College and Horgan Wellesley College all attended Fuller is proud of the number of women in charge of various business units at the Atlantabased company It is true to say that every one of them have been put in these positions since I got this job NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published October Alaska Producers Say Gas Pipeline Would Be Too Expensive A natural gas pipeline to the Lower states from Alaska would be too expensive to build and too risky according to a preliminary study by Exxon Mobil Corp Phillips Petroleum Co and BP Plc the three largest lease holders along the North Slope The producers told Alaska Gov Tony Knowles natural gas development team at a meeting last week in Anchorage that the project looks like a long shot at best The proposed pipeline would yield a rate of return on investment of about far less than the sought by the producers Neither the Alaska Highway route nor the Mackenzie Delta route would provide attractive enough returns to justify the enormous upfront costs associated with such a massive construction project according to preliminary analysis by the producers The Alaska Highway Route which is favored by state legislators because it would bring in more tax dollars provide instate jobs and have less environmental impact would cost about billion The significantly shorter route under the Beaufort Sea and south through Canadas McKenzie River valley would cost about billion the companies said according to the report Exxon Phillips and BP are still examining their findings but clearly consider the project a long shot Nevertheless they are still willing to examine potential cost cutting measures such as reducing construction costs and streamlining the permitting process to avoid delays Despite how some of the press are portraying it that the producers have scrapped the idea the Canadian press was writing the obituary on the Alaska highway gas line yesterday reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated to borrow a phrase said Knowles spokesman Bob King Actually I think there is some good news in what they said They talked about the project not meeting their goal of a rate of return but they did say it was profitable In fact they said it would provide a rate of return I think that portends well for the project Theres still a challenge and there are issues to be dealt with to make this project more economic King added There are some steps the state can take to address some of the risk but I think the fact that their projection that the gas line is profitable bodes well for the project They didnt say this project is over There still is a tremendous resource that is there Theres still a tremendous national need The governor is going to be in Washington DC this week to testify Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing Hell talk about his proposals which include some financial incentives in terms of investment tax credits and the like in order to help make this project economically viable King said Hes also mentioned accelerated depreciation and also some potential tax credits if gas prices turn south King noted the governor and the Alaska legislature are still vehemently opposed to the Mackenzie Delta route Alaska has passed a law essentially blocking that route The governor has always supported the Alaska Highway route He thinks the overthetop route is a nonstarter There are too many logistical and environmental concerns that I dont think can ever be resolved in order for it to happen There is a lot of opposition within the state from the Eskimos who depend on the Beaufort Sea for subsistence whale hunting Theyve made it very clear that they would strongly challenge any such project even though this is a group that is very supportive of responsible development on the Slope They want to make sure its done in an acceptable manner one that doesnt threaten their traditional lifestyles Another main criteria is making sure that Alaskans have access to the gas itself

Joshi The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The delicate relationship between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party has been stretched to a breaking point following differences over the appointment of a retired Supreme Court judge to head the panel to probe into the Enron issue According to sources the state government has completed necessary paper work after the state cabinet decided in principle to go for a judicial commission The NCP leadership is upset about the speed with which the commission is being constituted by the state administration The NCP wanted to go slow with the idea On Friday chief minister Deshmukh held a closed door meeting to decide on two issues whether to defer the constitution of the judicial panel and the NCP criticism on the chana dal and other issues aired after the Baramati conclave was convened by the party last week Though Deshmukh was not available Congress sources confirmed that the cabinet was unanimous over immediate constitution of the commission If the government is seen as buckling under the NCPs pressure and delaying the judicial probe then it will send a wrong signal to people a senior Congress minister observed Saturday adding We will not do anything to stop the process in midway The NCP leadership too is under pressures from other constituents of the Democratic Front ruling the state especially the Peasants and Workers Party and the Janata Dal Secular on the issue At one stage the senior PWP minister Ganpatrao Deshmukh had even threatened to resign from the cabinet if the probe was delayed and Chhagan Bhujbal deputy chief minister had to agree with the cabinet committee on the proposal for the commission The hawks in the NCP wanted the party oppose the move but the moderates noted that any opposition to the probe would give the impression to the masses that the NCP had something to hide The NCP has been arguing since the Prime Minister himself was trying to sort out the differences with Enron the state cabinet should not hurry up with appointment of the judicial commission and thereby close doors for negotiations Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc

debt and other obligations The Death Of A Pipedream Pamela Williams Australian Financial Review Page Copyright of John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd Some of the biggest names in Washington have been long associated with the dream of opening up the rich energy fields to rival Gulf oil But the war in Afghanistan has killed off one of the most ambitious projects The web site of the US oil giant Unocal tells a tale of corporate power in hiding It is a blunt statement of repudiation far from the covetous plans of the s for crossing Afghanistan with pipelines rich with oil and gas Instead in an admission of defeat the company has posted the message Unocal does not have nor do we plan to have any projects in Afghanistan We do not support the Taliban in any way whatsoever Hailed as the biggest single economic event of the st century with more oil and gas than Saudi Arabias fabled reserves the project was a multibillion dollar pipeline bringing gas from the prime Turkmenistan reserves across Afghanistan to the huge Indian and Pakistan markets Another pipeline would have carried oil from the Caspian reserves But in the project faced defeat as the civil rights and feminist lobby in the United States took on the oil giants over the suppression of human rights by the fervent Islamic clerics and mullahs of the Taliban They wrested the attention of the United Nations and forced the hand of then president Bill Clinton Notwithstanding years of pressure by Unocal and its starstudded array of consultants Clinton declared that the Talibans repression of womens rights meant there could be no recognition of the Government in Kabul It was a bitter blow for Unocal But now with the Taliban steadily being blasted from power there is renewed speculation that Unocal might seek to breathe new life into the project bringing a new frenzy of lobbyists and consultants from the US oil industry into the broken Afghan capital Absolutely not according to Unocal spokesman Barry Lane He rejects outright the suggestion that Unocal never gave up the pipeline dream and pressured new President George W Bush to reopen the door to the Taliban earlier this year Why would we want to go back in there Lane demands In the intervening three years since we pulled out our company has refocused its interests Furthermore he insists that Unocal never cut deals with the Taliban in the first place He is keen to paint the company which is a major donor to the Republican Party as having moved on to greener pastures It the Afghanistan pipeline proposal had all the earmarks of a very good project But there was no recognised government and therefore you could not get finance so the project could not go forward Lane says And we were always an advocate on womens rights and we pressured them the Taliban at the time he insists Thats not the way the very influential US lobby group The Feminist Majority remembers it This organisation rallied women and trade unions across America and galvanised Hollywood to rally for Afghan womens rights In the end the Clintons buckled Spokeswoman for The Feminist Majority Kathy Spillar says The whole world was willing to look the other way as this Taliban regime stripped women of every human right except to breathe while it planned on how to exploit these oil interests Now the eyes of the world are on what this new government will look like And were going to be watching the oil interests closely There are just too many times these brutal regimes have flourished while business interests look the other way The speculation about the continued pressure by oil companies on US foreign policy in Afghanistan has been fed by the publication of a new book which alleges that the oil giants stayed George Ws hand on investigating terrorism this year while they tried one last round of diplomacy to secure some concessions from the Taliban In Bin Laden the Forbidden Truth by JeanCharles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie the authors claim that under pressure from US oil companies George W Bushs Administration blocked intelligence agencies from investigating terrorism while it bargained with the Taliban to give up Osama bin Laden in exchange for political recognition and economic aid The authors claim that US oil companies and the US relationship with oilrich Saudi Arabia were the two greatest obstacles to hunting Islamic terrorists And they assert that until August this year the US goal was actually to consolidate the Taliban in the hope of finally striking the lucrative pipeline deals According to the book the US reopened negotiations with Taliban representatives in February this year meetings that continued until August just a month before New Yorks World Trade Center was attacked The authors claim as their source for this extraordinary revelation the former deputy director of the FBI John ONeill who for many years led the FBI investigations into Osama bin Ladens Al Qaeda network They say that ONeill this year complained bitterly that his investigations into bin Laden were blocked by the State Department and the oil lobby connected to President George W Bush In frustration ONeill resigned from the FBI In a chilling turn of events he took a new job as head of security at the World Trade Center He was killed on September in the attack on the twin towers Certainly the top layers of George W Bushs Administration enjoy excellent relations with the American oil giants Aside from the Bush familys oil background VicePresident Dick Cheney was until last year the chief executive of energy services giant Halliburton the National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice was a director of Chevron through the s and the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy Donald Evans and Spencer Abraham worked for oil company Tom Brown And Unocal includes on its board of directors Donald Rice who was Secretary of the Air Force under the first president Bush In its efforts to secure a pipeline deal with the Taliban in recent years Unocal went to extraordinary lengths With consultants on board such as the former US Ambassador to Pakistan Robert Oakley the company pursued all opportunities including donating nearly USmillion to the University of Nebraska to the school of Afghanistan Studies The money was used in part to set up training programs for Afghans who would work on the pipeline should Unocal end up in the box seat with the Taliban Taliban mullahs visited the US twice with representatives travelling to Houston in late as the guests of Unocal visiting the home of Unocal boss Marty Miller enjoying the sights with trips to the zoo and shopping centres On the side there were talks with the State Department All the while intense fighting raged across Afghanistan between the warlords and the Taliban and amongst the warlords themselves The CentGas project as the Unocal consortium with its major partner the Saudi company Delta Oil was known had to raise its funds by late to meet its deadlines But the fighting made it impossible to envision stability and finally the CentGas consortium began to unravel The stakes for the oil giant were huge In February Unocals vicepresident of international relations John Maresca testified before the House Committee on International Relations Maresca too was from the family fold having been George Bush Snrs Ambassador to Cyprus He outlined the glittering prospects if only the centre could be made to hold in Afghanistan Despite two decades of bitter warfare and the suppression of human rights Afghanistan was still the best option for Unocals pipelines as far as the company was concerned The route through Afghanistan is the one that would bring Central Asian oil closest to Asian markets and thus would be cheapest in terms of transporting the oil Maresca said And to bring gas there was the CentGas pipeline But as with the oil pipeline construction could not begin until an internationally recognised Afghanistan government was in place For the project to advance it must have international financing governmenttogovernment agreements and governmenttoconsortium agreements Four weeks later Bill Clinton with UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by his side dispatched Unocals hopes declaring there would be no diplomatic recognition for the Taliban In his bestselling book Taliban Ahmed Rashid quoted Yasushi Akashi the UN UnderSecretaryGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs speaking in The outside interference in Afghanistan is now all related to the battle for oil and gas pipelines The fear is that these companies and regional powers are just renting the Taliban for their own purposes The Taliban may now be all but gone but the oil and gas reserves in the region mean

REPORTS N Amer Oil Gas Industry On High Alert After FBI Warning Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON APThe oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death industry sources said Monday The sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline most of them buried crossing the US and Canada Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry of the natural gas transported according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters to issue a warning to oil and gas companies We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States said the memo adding that the information was from a source of undetermined reliability The FBI warning continued that such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the US retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America making protection of such lines difficult Aerial monitoring of pipelines have increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations according to industry officials who spoke on condition of anonymity

three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost k retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock In a press release Monday Eli Gottesdiener a Houston attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees said it seeks million in plan losses in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment Unlike two similar recently filed suits against Enron the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus If proven the sale without a prospectus give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest Gottesdiener said in a statement Enron locked down the retirement plan from Oct to Nov to make administrative changes which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems Earlier this month Houstonbased Dynegy Inc DYN offered to buy its far larger competitor in an allstock deal that values Enron shares at a piece or about billion Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be

Report c Phillips Business Information Inc A memorandum of understanding has been signed between subsidiaries of six US companies and three Canadian firms to immediately begin developing a proposal to build a mile natural gas pipeline being designed to transport Alaskan natural gas from the North Slope to Canada and the lower by The companies are hoping to present a proposal to producers by yearend If and when an agreement is reached with the producers the companies will move forward with the Alaskan portion of the project The US companies involved in the project include Williams Duke Energy Sempra Energy International Enron PGE Corp El Paso Corp while TransCanada PipeLines Westcoast Energy and Foothills Pipe Lines represent the Canadian parties The signing of the MOU is significant because it shows a renewed interest in eliminating the historic and other commercial roadblocks to building the project according to our source All of the companies are the original partners in the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co which was designed by the President and US Congress to build and operate the Alaskan portion of the project in The companies dropped out of the project years ago even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had already received approval for the project Numerous other federal permits for the construction and operation of the Alaskan Natural Gas Transportation System ANGTS are already in place The statutory framework for the project provides for a quick approval of the remaining permits needed before construction can begin This is a big step forward in bringing Alaskas natural gas to markets in the Lower said Alaska Senator Frank Murkowski I always have believed that construction of an Alaskan gas transportation system to the Lower is going to take the synergistic efforts of pipeline companies and the oil and gas production companies in cooperation with the State the federal government and Canada While this does not guarantee construction of a North Slope gas delivery system it is a big step in the right direction Wall Street Oil oil boil and trouble Financial Times FTcom c Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved A short week on Wall Street appeared a very long week for the energy sector an industry that has in everything from oil to electricity succeeded in delivering some stinging surprises to the US economy this year Last Sunday Conoco and Phillips Petroleum jolted merger and acquisition specialists out of their torpor with the years biggest deal a bn merger of equals to create the thirdlargest integrated energy company in the US and the sixthlargest in the world Coincidentally on Monday ChevronTexaco feted the consummation of its merger with a New York analysts meeting at which David OReilly the combined groups chief executive promised higher than expected annual savings of bn by Whether the sector needs another clumsy baptism the fruit of Sundays announcement will inevitably be saddled with the name ConocoPhillips is not really at issue Consolidation that began in the s has left mediumsized energy companies such as Conoco and Phillips with little option but to combine resources for exploration and production in order to compete with supermajors such as ExxonMobil Volatile oil prices another story of the week appear to add to the urgency of the combination although James Mulva Phillipss chairman and chief executive denied that was a prime reason for consolidation After all the industry has learned to live with volatility These are companies that in just three years have shrugged off concerns about what would happen if crude oil remained at a barrel and at the other extreme the possibility of crude lingering above In the short term the fate of stock prices in the sector may depend on Opecs ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in its confrontation with Norway and in particular Russia over calls for a cut in oil output to underpin the world price Oil stocks as measured by the Philadelphia Oil Service index have had a turbulent time since September plummeting initially only to rally back to their levels before the terrorist attacks and then slump again as the wrangling between Opec and nonOpec oil producers burst into the open ChevronTexaco for one seemed unperturbed by the standoff If you want a stable price environment you dont want to be in this business OReilly said on Monday He was talking about the oil price but he might just as easily have been referring to energy stocks Energyrelated industries from utilities to pipelines make up six of the worstperforming sectors over the past month according to Dow Jones data analysed by CBS Marketwatch None however has fallen as precipitously or as publicly as Enron the energy trading company Its share price at the close on Wednesday was down per cent on the week and per cent below its week high of nearly Remember that this was a company that outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index even as the technologyheavy index rose to its March peak In addition Enron remained at stratospheric price and valuation levels even after the dotcoms whose magic dust its online trading operations borrowed fell to earth In the process its ability to pioneer new trading markets such as bandwidth made it the envy of Wall Streets own brokerdealers jealous of its trading bravado and its share rating Two of Wall Streets giants JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are now helping to prop up the group laid low by its failure to disclose adequately offbalancesheet transactions that it carried out as part of its rapid expansion The two banks are advising Enron on a rescue bid from Dynegy the much smaller rival energy group partowned by ChevronTexaco and backing it with bn of credit secured on pipeline assets The trigger for this weeks sharp decline was Enrons regulatory filing late on Monday which revealed for the first time to shaken shareholders and bondholders that the group would have to repay m of notes next Tuesday because of a downgrade days ago by Standard Poors Wednesdays announcement that Enron had managed to postpone that deadline until the middle of next month seemed to do little to allay the crisis of confidence about the groups ability to repay its heavy debts Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday few share traders seemed to want to hold the stock which fell per cent on Wednesday alone and electricity and gas counterparties are also wary of entering longterm contracts in the markets that Enron helped pioneer The Enron debacle is a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change Earlier this year the wellconnected and politically influential Houstonbased group was powerful enough to be accused by Californians of playing a key role in provoking the electricity crisis on the west coast Now Enrons shares and bonds are trading as though it may go bust If it does it could drag down other weaker energy companies because of its role as a marketmaker supplying liquidity to the power and gas markets If the worst fears of some Wall Street bankers are realised there may even be repercussions for the wider financial markets where Enron lays off the

competition for market share and the threat of global recession have caused oil prices to plummet Investors have regarded this as a positive development since low energy prices can help resuscitate struggling western economies However the markets may be pricing the wrong end of the equation for it is supply not demand that may prove a shock to the system At issue is risk in the Middle East As the war against terrorism moves beyond the Taliban the USled coalition will turn elsewhere to root out supporters of alQaeda and other terrorist networks The top suspects are Saudi Arabia Iran and Iraq oil exporters with per cent of the worlds reserves among them Pressure on these regimes to change their position on terrorism will mount in the coming months But with the present governments in place none is likely to do so The Saudis and Iranians are unable the Iraqis unwilling While Saudi Arabia has been a military and economic ally of the US its business and religious leaders have long supported the Taliban and alQaeda Full cooperation with the investigations of September and severance of the financial networks that supported it would critically expose the ruling family Meanwhile domestic opinion in Saudi Arabia runs counter to the interests of the USled coalition For Crown Prince Abdullah to maintain authority he must take a far more radical stance against the US Signs of Saudi intransigence have grown accordingly Prince Abdullah stated that the US and Saudi Arabia should recognise and pursue their separate interests and stepped up criticism of US policy on Palestine and Iraq Irans internal stability is also in doubt Iran tops the US list of state sponsors of terrorism through its continued support of Hamas and Hezbollah President Mohammad Khatami would like to move his country towards the west privately his advisers hint that he is prepared to make significant concessions on the terrorism issue But despite an overwhelming electoral victory for the reformers last June authority remains in the hands of the Khameneiled conservatives who soften their stance at their peril The political situation in Iran where soccer riots have led to widespread antigovernment demonstrations leaves little room for compromise Demographics work against both regimes Rapidly expanding and extremely young populations have led to high unemployment and drastically diminished per capita income Oil prices in the teens could not come at a worse time guaranteeing crippling budget deficits and cutbacks on stretched social services Together with pressure from the west the position of both regimes is increasingly untenable Saddam Hussein Iraqs president has little concern for domestic instability But reports of Iraqi intelligence connections to the September terrorists coupled with Mr Saddams alleged development of biological and chemical weapons make it hard for the US to avoid escalation President George W Bush does not yet subscribe to the view of many in the defence department that Iraq should be the USs next military target but pressure to remove Mr Hussein from power will undoubtedly increase Further stirring the pot the propaganda war is being lost by the US and the UK Few in the Middle East feel any sympathy for Mr bin Laden but the war in Afghanistan remains unpopular Many are incensed by harm to Iraqi civilians over the issue of sanctions and by US support for Israel As the war against terrorism moves closer to them these feelings will intensify further destabilising isolated regimes The danger is not that Saudi Arabia or their neighbours will stop selling oil to the west on principle their need for petrodollars is overwhelming The risk is that one or more key oil producers will face a sudden crisis of government disrupting the flow of oil And there are other dangers such as a terrorist attack on key refineries or pipelines Nevertheless few economists are seriously discussing the possibility of a jump in oil prices They remain focused on prospects for recovery in the middle of next year Significantly higher prices are far from certain but a barrel for any sustained period would damage or stall any recovery Washington can do little to help Using its strategic oil reserves is a possibility as is exploiting new reserves in Alaska Strategic discussions with Russia to keep supply high and increased flows from the Caspian would also help Either way a recovery is dependent upon maintaining stability in the Middle East US fixes are simply nibbling around the edges Ian Bremmer is president of

pipelines if bin Laden killed or captured PETER KENNEDY The Globe and Mail Metro Page A All material Copyright c Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc and its licensors All rights reserved VANCOUVER Canadas oilandgas sector is on high alert after learning of a threat that associates of Osama bin Laden may be planning to sabotage energy installations and pipelines in North America A spokesman for BC Gas Utility Ltd confirmed yesterday that the company has received a copy of a warning it believes was distributed to about members of the Washington DCbased American Petroleum Institute last week In a confidential letter the institute said it had received information from a source of unde termined reliability warning that an attack will take place if Mr bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is either captured are killed The letter contained no details on who issued the warning how such an attack would be carried out or which facilities would be targeted BC Gas spokesman Dean Pelkey said the warning may be the work of a prankster But at the same time when something like this comes out you cant dismiss it out of hand he said Since Sept we have increased security at our facilities and we are being more vigilant in watching and monitoring our pipelines I think other oilandgas companies are likely doing the same he said Mr Pelkey said he believes the confidential warning was sent to other Canadian members of API which according to its Web site include Alberta companies PetroCanada and Syncrude Canada Ltd Contacted yesterday officials at PetroCanada and Syncrude Canada said they were not aware of the warning They said their security measures have been stepped up since the Sept attacks Syncrude Canada spokeswoman Cherry Holland said the oil sands companys employees have been told to wear personal identification tags at all times A PetroCanada official said the company has installed fencing and surveillance cameras around its Edmonton refinery Company employees also need security cards to get in and out of PetroCanadas office buildings We are cognizant of the events of Sept as terrible as they were and it is certainly accurate to say that we are being very conscious of security measures lately PetroCanada spokesman Chris Dawson said News of the warning comes just weeks after oilpatch representatives met with Alberta government officials to talk about security At the meetings Sept Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said the government needs to see an inventory of what oilandgas sector projects around the province need increased security He said government and industry need to co ordinate their efforts A spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declined to discuss the API warning On matters like this we make absolutely no comment

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp ENE heres another piece of evidence one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the companys stock Enron doesnt simply trade for less than its book value it fell below that milestone weeks ago No now it trades for less than ONETHIRD of its book value Thats a rare level for a company of Enrons size and prominence And it may mean among other things that investors have decided that they simply cant place any further faith in the veracity of Enrons earnings and balancesheet figures muchrevised as theyve been something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly First lets be clear about what this means Enron stock is currently about a share the companys reported book value is about a share In other words Enron stock sells for less than onethird of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate were to turn all its assets into cash pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give whats left over to shareholders This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company even a troubled one For comparisons sake Dynegy Inc DYN which has agreed to buy Enron trades at about three times book value as does El Paso Corp EPG a competitor of both companies In fact Enron has the secondlowest pricetobook ratio of any company in the Standard Poors stock index only Conseco Inc CNC another troubled company is lower by an eyelash Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegys agreement to buy Enron will fall apart and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does in which case Enron shareholders would be hardpressed to realize any value The Dynegy deal now amounts to about per Enron share itself well under Enrons book value the huge premium that level offers over Enrons current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal wont be consummated in its current form But given Enrons current woes its certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors dont feel they can trust the earnings and balancesheet numbers coming out of Enron Those numbers after all are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron or any other company by computing figures like pricetobook and pricetoearnings ratios And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted In terms of those numbers the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships when it restated nearly five years worth of earnings downward by a total of million and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a million note That deadline has now been extended until Dec When youve gotten punched in the face three times its not unreasonable to fear therell be a fourth blow no matter how much the puncher assures you there wont be Given Enrons insanely complicated structure and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks who can guarantee there arent more such shocks yet to come Thats what investors appear to be fearing and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously Thanks to Enrons repeated demonstrations that its numbers cant be relied on investors no longer have a firm trustworthy basis on which to value the stock And so not surprisingly the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative bareminimum level An Enron spokesman couldnt be reached for comment Its ironic in a way For a long time it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher Now its hard to properly value Enron because the companys attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that its hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy By Michael Rapoport Dow Jones Newswires Nov AM Oil gas industry on high alert after FBI warning Associated Press WASHINGTON The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death industry sources said today The sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline most of them buried crossing the United States and Canada Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry percent of the natural gas transported according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters to issue a warning to oil and gas companies We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States said the memo adding that the information was from a source of undetermined reliability The FBI warning continued that such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the US retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan Also some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites Access to facilities has been tightened as well officials said

expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp ENE by renegotiating a million payment due Nov But investors shouldnt be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isnt ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc DYN Over the last few years Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of billion in Enron exposure Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I which together raised billion Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co which raised a combined GBP million and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust which issued EUR million Citigroup which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts receives the return on the portfolio of singleAplusorbetterrated securities purchased with the proceeds of the offerings in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure according to Mary Ryan director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard Poors As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes Ryan said If Enron defaults Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust The singleAplusorhigherrated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now indefault Enron debt obligations And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce or maybe even scrap its offer to buy Enron the chances of a such a defaultdriven transfer would appear to be rising These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron For instance the holders of these notes because they dont possess actual Enron obligations and wont unless the company defaults are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enrons rating of tripleBminus from Standard Poors and Baa from Moodys Investors Service The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enrons ratings Citigroup officials did not respond to

troubled energy giant Enron Corp continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc will fall through Enron stock was down cents or percent at in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange Dynegy has agreed to pay per share for Enron The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms said Michael Heim an industry analyst at AG Edwards Sons Heim said that among three possible scenarios the deal goes through as planned it is canceled or it is restructured the first is the least likely Escape clauses built into the DynegyEnron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enrons business or assets Dynegy has a good claim that the material adverse condition clause has already been triggered either by the million loan being accelerated earnings being down or the ongoing trading business weakness he said Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a million debt this week because of a credit downgrade but the payment deadline has been delayed until midDecember Enrons recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets could cause low fourthquarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place Heim said Besides trading and marketing what value does Enron have The majority of Enrons physical assets are spoken for with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise

Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Nov Reuters A Washington DC lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers stock through k retirement plans How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a k plan lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated million on Enron stock held in their k retirement accounts The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices All three suits seek classaction status Enrons shares have fallen from a high of in August to less than today their decline accelerating since Oct amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances Like many other companies Enron makes matching contributions to its employees k retirement accounts in its own stock It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from midOctober due to a change in the retirement plans administrator Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than percent of a portfolio in a single stock but that participants in k plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold percent of their portfolio in that stock Congress sensibly placed a percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in but at the behest of the corporate lobby it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans he said The absence of such a cap in definedcontribution k plans was completely indefensible he said Gottesdieners suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This story was published originally Friday NEW YORK Dow Jones Heres one outlook that couldnt have been more wrong Around this time last year pundits and fund managers were touting the perfect storm of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in Then came the California power crisis and allegations of pricegouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices and this time the prices were headed down not up And then came a crushing blow against trading firms the unraveling of the industrys largest player Enron Corp ENE Simply put the perfect storm stalled and a business once buoyed by high gas prices strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around ninetimes earnings about where traditional utilities trade And the chance for recovery in Basu Mullick portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund is willing to bet there is He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same pricetoearnings multiple as the broader markets median which is currently between to times future earnings he said Its just a matter of time before the stocks get there They were just recovering from Gray Davis Mullick said referring to the governor of California who had accused outofstate energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state and triggering the states energy crisis Now they are recovering from Enron The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates he said I dont think they should get the same valuation as a gardenvariety utility Still others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies strategies and financial disclosures Enrons precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues Although many of Enrons financial problems arent solely the fault of marktomarket accounting issues there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create Answers Elude Investors Investors are asking hard questions and not always getting the answers they want Using marktomarket methods a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position whether its a contract an option a swap etc at the time even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment Also sometimes it isnt easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isnt liquid Over time companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their marktomarket gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure said ABN AMRO Inc analyst Paul Patterson Encouragingly it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure According to a survey Patterson conducted more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their marktomarket accounting practices during thirdquarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cashbased All things being equal we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not he said He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by marktomarket accounting At the end of the day it is not a matter of simply producing profits but being able to say where those earnings came from said one investor who manages a pension fund Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce Tim OBrien portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies Still the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc DYN Duke Energy Corp DUK and Dominion Resources Inc D According to OBrien the group never deserved to have the pricetoearnings multiples above to times earnings which were once paid for the stocks We all got sucked up by the upleg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are OBrien said adding that the average multiple should be in the high singledigits to the highteens As for independent power producers which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio according to OBrien One analogy is that they are basically like commercial realestate plays OBrien said That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp CPN which is already in the lowerhalf of its trading range may have further to fall By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved INDIA UPDATE Indias AV Birla group denies bid for

Enrons share price has made it more likely that Dynegy and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal in which of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding Enron

of Dynegy backing out On Monday Michael Heim also of AG Edwards attributed Enrons latest stock drop to growing belief that the likelihood of the merger deal is not so likely He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is not very favorable but in the meantime its doing everything it can to stay afloat while working on closing the deal Last week Enron said it got a bank extension on a million note

By H JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved WASHINGTON AP The FBI has warned energy companies that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack North American natural gas pipelines and facilities if he is captured or killed Natural gas producers and pipeline companies continued to be on a high state of alert industry executives said Monday although they declined to discuss the latest warning which was sent in a memo to industry security officials last week In Bismarck Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline officials put employees on notice that they need to implement security measures spokeswoman Laura Lueder said The company a subsidiary of MDU Resources serves North Dakota South Dakota Montana and Wyoming The company always had security measures outlined for these kind of situations but it did update the measures following the Sept attacks Lueder said Attorney General John Ashcroft confirmed the FBI warning though he expressed some doubt that attacks would be conditioned on bin Ladens capture or death It didnt take anything specific to trigger the attacks on the World Trade Center or the Pentagon said Ashcroft when asked about the alert at a news conference Even so those are the kinds of reports which we take seriously The alert did not single out a specific target but referred to natural gas supplies including the more than miles of gas pipelines and hundreds of pumping stations and other facilities We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States said the memo according to several industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity Such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed the alert continued The FBI alert said the information came from a source of undetermined reliability and that no additional details on how such an attack would be carried out or which facilities would be targeted could be learned Since the Sept terrorist attacks the energy industries including operators of nuclear power plants refineries pipelines and power grids have scrambled to increase security on a belief that they could be singled out for another round of attacks One industry source characterized the FBI warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts In that case no further evidence of potential terrorist activity emerged The alert was sent on Nov from FBI headquarters to agency field offices which then forwarded the information to industry officials The alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters to issue a memo last Wednesday to oil and gas companies Energy industry executives were reluctant to discuss the latest alert or their security measures although several confirmed the memo and said additional precautions have been taken Still the potential for a terrorist attack has left some industry officials jittery We prefer to keep a low profile said an official of one of the largest natural gas pipeline companies agreeing to speak only on background so that the company would not publicly be singled out Our facilities are on high alert and they have been since Sept said Laurie Cramer a spokeswoman for the Natural Gas Supply Association which represents natural gas producers There are miles of natural gas transmission lines crossing the country and another million miles of local distribution lines Although most of the lines are buried aerial surveillance of major pipelines has been increased and security tightened at pumping stations industry officials said Access to facilities has been restricted as well officials said Also some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites But the industry is in a quandary over how much information should be withheld about the location of pipelines which often must be clearly marked to prevent someone from accidentally rupturing one when digging The availability of maps also has helped to promote acceptance of pipelines in communities We want people to know where they are to prevent accidents said Benjamin Cooper executive director of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines But he acknowledged the desire for public disclosure now is being tempered somewhat for security concerns The biggest danger to natural gas pipelines on an ongoing basis is the line being hit by a backhoe or heavy equipment said Kelly Merritt a spokesman for Columbia Gas Transmission Corp one of the countrys biggest pipeline companies While a rupture of a gas or oil pipeline could cause significant problems industry experts emphasized that most lines are relatively isolated and even a major break in a line can normally be repaired fairly quickly Heads Urge Pipe Safety Passage Natural Gas Week P c Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved WASHINGTON DC A letter to US Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta urged passage of an effective and responsible pipeline safety bill In the letter released last week pipeline leaders offered their assistance to the department and said Our industries have joined together to address both regulatory and legislative pipeline safety issues in a unified fashion Signing the letter were leaders of the oil and natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline industries and the leaders of the five key trade associations which include the American Gas Association American Petroleum Institute Association of Oil Pipe Lines American Public Gas Association and Interstate Natural Gas Association of America The letter came with the industrys unified position paper calling for regulatory and legislative action on pipeline safety The industry is urging an adequately staffed and funded Office of Pipeline Safety and other measures to increase safety and enhance public confidence Enron and Dynegy Discuss Plan to Cut Price of Acquisition By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel The Wall Street Journal Page A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp struggling to save its twoweekold deal to be acquired by Dynegy Inc was in advanced discussions with Dynegy to cut the price of the allstock transaction by more than to about billion according to people familiar with the matter Beleaguered Enron also was in continuing negotiations to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis these people said Enron has total debt of about billion Increasingly analysts are worried that the giant energytrading concerns relatively few hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they cant be used to support further borrowing Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at pm yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange falling cents to a share Over the past few months about billion of Enrons stock value has evaporated a process that has accelerated since midOctober when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base Since then revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off Enrons books have spooked investors and triggered a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation Recently the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress The move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement and particularly to slash the number of Dynegy shares that Enron holders would receive only two weeks after the pacts signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions While terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments that typically doesnt happen until a transaction is nearly completed Enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement yesterday that would calm its anxious investors but the situation remained fluid throughout the day As of yesterday evening the revised deal still hadnt been formalized The deal is critical for Enron In recent weeks creditrating agencies have indicated they will refrain from further cuts to Enrons credit rating so long as a Dynegy purchase appears probable But if that deal collapses downgrades could occur that would put Enron below investment grade and in violation of credit agreements with counterparties This in turn could deal a savage blow to Enrons commoditytrading business that is its lifeblood Negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of Houston yesterday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban New York where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal which was announced Nov Both Dynegy and Enron declined to comment on the discussions One apparent sticking point in the talks was arriving at a new stockexchange ratio Under the current acquisition agreement Dynegy would exchange share for each Enron share tendered Based on yesterdays New York Stock Exchange closing price of for Dynegy shares down Enron holders stand to receive a share for their stock or a total of about billion People close to the discussions said the new ratio is expected to be less than share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock which would value Enron at less than a share or about billion Another contentious issue concerns the amount of additional capital Enron needs to shore up its finances A week ago the company disclosed it may have to post hundreds of millions of dollars or more to honor collateral calls before the end of the year The problem for potential lenders is finding good assets to back these continued infusions of capital sought by Enron As part of the original merger agreement Dynegy already has injected billion into Enron receiving in exchange preferred stock in its Northern Natural Gas Co pipeline system that runs from the upper Midwest to Texas Under the agreement if the acquisition falls apart Dynegy will have the right to acquire of the equity in the Northern Natural Gas subsidiary thus giving it the full value of its investment But that arrangement is raising questions on Wall Street about whether creditors are throwing good money after bad Northern Natural Gas already is heavily encumbered with debts In addition to million in unsecured public debt and billion put in by Dynegy and coinvestor ChevronTexaco Inc a bank consortium led by JP Morgan Chase Co recently put in an additional million in cash backed by Northerns assets The bank consortium also provided million to Enron against which assets of Enrons Transwestern Pipeline Co unit were pledged This system a network between Texas and California is the only other domestic gastransportation system fully owned by Enron That brings total indebtedness to nearly billion for two Enron pipeline systems that only generated transportation revenue of million and million respectively in the third quarter Enrons entire naturalgas pipeline business which includes two other partially owned systems produced pretax earnings of million for the third quarter flat with the yearearlier period Some observers said that if the Enron deal to be acquired by Dynegy falls apart this could set the stage for a fight among the different classes of creditors for a priority claim on the pipeline assets Jathon Sapsford contributed to this article Fair Shares Why Company Stock Is a Burden for Many And Less So for a Few Workers Often Must Hold On To Stakes Held in ks Top Brass Have Options Hedging for the Upper Tier By Ellen E Schultz and Theo Francis The Wall Street Journal Page A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc In the s as the stock market climbed year after year many corporations and their employees entered into a marriage of convenience The company would dole out its own shares as compensation and benefits Employees would have a steadily appreciating asset that encouraged loyalty and created an incentive to work hard for the companys success Theyre still doing it Gillette Co for example believes it is important that employee interests be aligned with company interests says spokesman Stephen K Brayton echoing the explanations of dozens of other companies that use their own stock for executive pay incentive bonuses or contributions to k retirementsavings accounts But as share prices have fallen over the past year and a half it has become clear that not all stock handouts are created equal Millions of rankandfile workers at hundreds of companies have found themselves shackled to big chunks of company stock while executives are able to exercise wide latitude in what they do with theirs Because of the law capping taxdeductible executive compensation at million a year many companies top off their executive pay packages with stock options as well as bonuses and other incentives that are typically paid in stock much of it unencumbered Based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission hundreds of companies use their own stock in lieu of cash as their matching contributions to employees retirementsavings accounts And the majority of those restrict the ability of employees to sell the shares and move the proceeds into mutual funds and other alternatives offered through their ks Benefits consultants Hewitt Associates found in a recent study that nearly half of firms offering company stock in their k plans only contribute their own shares to employee accounts and that of those companies restrict sales of the stock Gillette doesnt let employees switch out of its stock contributions to their ks until age according to government filings At CocaCola Co its age Procter Gamble Co Qwest Communications International Inc and troubled Enron Corp now facing lawsuits over employees k losses are among the many others that impose similar restrictions So far this year Gillette employees have had to watch the companycontribution portion of their retirement savings shrink by millions of dollars as the share price has fallen Employees at CocaCola have endured a shareprice decline this year of Procter Gamble shares have been flat The companies point out that executives participate in the same k plans as other employees subject to the same restrictions Still the bulk of company stock that executives own is usually held outside such restricted accounts At Qwest with a share price down so far this year top executives and directors have sold a combined million of Qwest shares so far this year according to SEC data collected by Thomson FinancialLancer Analytics Qwest Chief Executive Joseph P Nacchio alone has sold Qwest shares valued at million Likewise many companies offer supplemental savings plans for executives that dont force them to hold company stock Some top executives at CocaCola can participate in a supplemental retirementsavings plan with a guaranteed annual return of Executives at Qwest are able to contribute as much as of their salaries and bonuses to a supplemental plan in which they can allocate their own and company contributions as they like Executives also can protect themselves without selling their shares and triggering taxes by using hedging techniques offered for just that purpose by firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc Eaton Vance Corp and Bessemer Trust Co Disclosure of these deals to the SEC is generally required but spotty It clearly has been a growing business and very busy in the last months says Michael Dweck head of the Single Stock Risk Management division at Goldman Sachs The firms marketing these hedging strategies typically hedge their own side of the transactions to protect themselves as well People recognize the inherent risk of holding all your wealth in a single stock His operation generally wont arrange transactions for blocks of stock worth less than million Its for the upper tier of management Mr Dweck says For the rest companies point out employees have ample opportunity to diversify their retirementsavings portfolios by investing their own contributions in other options offered Indeed many workers have illadvisedly put a lot of their own k money into their employers stock Wyn Triska a yearold powerplant technician for an Enron unit in Estacada Ore says he warned many of his coworkers of the dangers of wagering all their retirement savings on Enron Even when Enron was going up he says I never put a cent into it it just doesnt make sense to load up on one stock Nonetheless even he has been unable to sell the stock that Enron has contributed to his k as the share price has plummeted from a little more than a year ago to around now Under the companys k rules he cant sell until age For many rankandfile workers riskaverse or not their ks are their largest assets apart from their homes So holding company stock they cant sell has become a source of resentment and frustration Federal pension law leaves k plans largely outside the realm of regulation But lately some employees have taken their frustration to the courts Just this month in three separate lawsuits the latest filed yesterday participants in Enrons k plan allege that Enron misled them about the risks of investing in the companys shares The suits all filed in Federal District Court in Houston note that the company locked down the retirement plan from Oct to Nov to make administrative changes That prevented all employees regardless of age from selling any Enron shares in their ks as the stock price collapsed amid financial turmoil at the company and an SEC investigation into its accounting practices Enron says it doesnt comment on pending litigation Those lawsuits along with a handful filed against other companies recently dont take on directly the practice of forcing employees to accept and hold company stock in their ks Thats perfectly legal So whatever the outcome a company would still be able to restrict employee sales of companystock contributions to k before the price declines Even when theyve had gains they cant really lock them in because they cant diversify says Randall Shoker an Oxford Ohio financial adviser Michael Green knows that The yearold investment specialist joined Dell Computer Corp in as a product manager He and his wife Lisa an assistant controller at the company were thrilled as the stock rose to about a share in late from in mid adjusted for splits But by the late s the couple felt overexposed to Dell In addition to the Dell stock that the company had contributed to their k plans they had received stock options as bonuses And they had bought a home in Austin Texas where the realestate market is tied in part to the fortunes of Dell one of the areas biggest employers The Greens sold some of the stock they received as bonuses But Dell wouldnt let employees sell shares the company contributed to their retirement accounts until they had been at the company for five years I tried so hard to sell Mr Green says We went around and around The company changed its policy last year to allow all Dell employees to sell the shares in their k plan and shift the proceeds into alternatives available through the plan By then though Dell shares had plummeted erasing from the Greens k accounts Thats as much as we paid for our house Mr Green says Both left Dell earlier this year for other jobs SEC filings show that Dell executives though subject to the same restrictions on their regular k accounts can participate in a supplementary retirementsavings plan that allows them immediately to reinvest the companys contribution in a variety of options Executives have seized that opportunity Just of the supplementary retirement plan was invested in Dell stock at the end of last year according to the companys latest K filing compared with about of Dells k plan Dell spokesman TR Reid declines to comment on the Greens circumstances He says that any employees who lose so much money on company contributions could do so only because they had made a bundle until that point And providing Dell shares to the employee retirementsavings plan he says certainly provides incentive to not only think but act like a shareholder The company ended the fiveyear lockdown rule Mr Reid says because it was no longer necessary to keep employees focused on improving Dells shareholder value And he says Dell executives dont have to hold company stock in their supplementary plan because they receive a significant portion of their compensation in Dell stock and thus they already have the broader interests of the company and shareholders squarely in their sights SEC filings show that Dell executives nonetheless have means to protect themselves from exposure to the companys stock Michael Dell chairman and chief executive of the computer company he founded transferred a total of million shares worth million into socalled exchange funds in several transactions between September and May The shares accounted for about of Mr Dells total company holdings at the time Offered by financial firms to the wealthy exchange funds are in essence mutual funds that allow holders of large chunks of a single stock to pool their assets giving them a stake in a diversified lessrisky basket of securities and in some cases postponing tax liabilities Altogether the value of Mr Dells hedged shares would have fallen in market value by or million by earlier this month had he taken no precautions The return on the diversified exchange fund isnt disclosed Until the fiveyear rule was lifted employees like Mr Green could get out of their Dell k holdings only by withdrawing money from their accounts paying income tax and a penalty on the withdrawal and then reinvesting the difference Or says Dell spokesman Mike Maher they could have elected to take their compensation and not put it in their k and invest it in some other stock By doing so however they would have forgone the companys matching contribution altogether Mr Maher declines to comment on Mr Dells transactions He notes that like executives regular employees who receive options are free to sell their shares Were all playing by the same rules he says The hedging maneuvers executives can employ to protect their company holdings fall largely off the radar screens of regulators and shareholders While the SEC generally requires that key executives report these transactions experts say the rules are largely ignored We really are only able to uncover several a month at most which leads me to believe that the insiders are not filing these as often as they should says Lon Gerber director of research at Thomson FinancialLancer Analytics which combs SEC filings to track insider trading trends Mr Dweck head of the Goldman Sachs division that manages singlestock investments for wealthy investors says his groups clients disclose their transactions when required And Qwest Chairman Philip Anschutz recently disclosed that last May he entered into a forwardsale agreement with a brokerage firm locking in as many as million Qwest shares at close to their thencurrent price Qwests share price has since fallen the value of Mr Anschutzs shares covered in the agreement would have plunged to million from million Those shares amounted to about of Mr Anschutzs total holding of million shares or of Qwests shares outstanding both directly and through a company he controls A forwardsale agreement wasnt available to Joseph Daugherty He has been stringing and repairing telephone cable for years first for Bell South Corp and then in the Salt Lake City area for U S West which was acquired by Qwest last year A few months ago he was looking forward to early retirement next summer But now he says hell have to keep working The in assets he had in his k in early May has shrunk to roughly Part of that loss is attributable to the retirement plans rules which dont allow most workers to shift out of companycontributed Qwest shares until age Mr Daugherty who concedes hes a risktaker blames himself for the rest He voluntarily sank the remainder of his k savings into Qwest stock Qwest wont comment on the finances of either Mr Daugherty or Mr Anschutz But Steve Hammack a Qwest spokesman says U S West established the policy of contributing company stock He notes that starting Jan the company began allowing managers to diversify company stock contributions they receive this year into other investments available through the plan The restrictions on union members he says are covered by the companys collective bargaining agreement The fact is Mr Hammack responds in an email the majority of companies in the US that match employee contributions do so in their own company stock A good number also restrict employees from diversifying out of the company match Erisa the federal law governing pension plans provides employees with little legal traction to complain about their forced k holdings Employer contributions to retirementsavings plans arent generally subject to fiduciary rules As for employee contributions employers are supposed to choose prudent investment options Retirementsavings plans are exempt from Erisa diversification rules too These rules make it illegal for a companys pension plan to invest more than of its assets in the companys own securities But savings plans such as ks can generally invest as much as of the assets in company stock with impunity Currently roughly onethird to onehalf of retirementplan assets at large companies are invested in company stock That suits employers which would just as soon contribute stock as draw down precious cash and in the past they have lobbied successfully to defeat efforts to impose diversification rules on ks That confounds people such as Mr Triska the technician at Enrons Portland General Electric unit Anyone will tell you that you need to diversify to reduce risk he says Diversification has spared Mr Triska some of the pain experienced by coworkers who bet big on Enron in their retirement savings Since Sept while the Enron shares in his k have plunged his shares in Weitz Partners Value Fund have declined only and his shares in Fidelity Growth Company and Janus Global Life Sciences funds have risen and respectively Enron executives are subject to the same restrictions on Enrons stock contributions to their ks as other employees no sales of companycontributed stock until age But company filings with the SEC show that key management and highly compensated employees also participate in separate retirementsavings plans that dont require them to hold Enron stock at all Executives can pile as much as of their salaries and of their bonuses annually into these accounts allocating the money among a variety of investments Further SEC filings show that so far this year many Enron executives were steady sellers of company stock they had accumulated beyond the ambit of their ks Former Enron Broadband Services Chief Executive Kenneth Rice for example sold Enron shares valued at million during the period and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling sold million of Enron stock We believe its important

offer from rival Dynegy Inc would be completed under the current terms Enrons stock slide coupled with traders shying away from Enrons core energy trading business that Dynegy wants most raises the question of whether the energy giant can maintain enough assets to keep Dynegy interested said Mike Heim an analyst with AG Edwards Sons I think Dynegys really got Enrons back against the wall and at a minimum I think restructuring is possible Mr Heim said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa reiterated yesterday that the company is moving forward with the acquisition of its larger troubled rival and we

Enron declined to comment on its financial problems But Enrons stock has dropped more than percent since the Dynegy deal was announced Nov Investors believe that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal at a cheaper price or even try to abandon it said Brian Youngberg a financial analyst with Edward D Jones Co in St Louis The Dynegy deal values Enron at more than a share For a company thats trading at that doesnt make much sense said Youngberg who last week recommended that customers sell Enron shares As part of the Dynegy deal Enron received billion in cash secured by stock in one of its pipelines But without another large infusion of cash the company faces what Youngberg called a death spiral Along with investors many energy buyers and traders have lost confidence in Enrons ability to make good on the longterm energy contracts it specializes in Youngberg said Enrons most important operations involve contracts to deliver natural gas electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities in the future It also sells financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices These deals are the one part of Enron that Dynegy wants Their core business has dropped off sharply said Andrew Meade an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York Enron remains a sizable player in the huge daily trading of energy products but is being frozen out of longterm markets and relegated to less profitable shortterm trades said Meade The lengthy span of Enrons crisis which began a month ago when it reported a billion reduction in shareholder equity has given companies time to close out contracts with Enron or limit their potential losses if Enron were to fail said Louis B Gagliardi an analyst with John S Herold Inc in Connecticut If Enron went to a Chapter bankruptcy or failed it would unsettle the market slightly But it wouldnt catch people by surprise So theres not much danger of a crisis on the natural gas or power side of energy trading Gagliardi said Other market participants cautioned that the extent of Enrons obligations to trading partners is not known to outsiders making the impact of an Enron failure hard to assess Dynegy and its partner ChevronTexaco Corp could pump billions of dollars into Enrons operations if the purchase went through but under the best of circumstances regulatory review of the deal will drag on for another six months Investors and traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang around that long by itself That just adds to the uncertainty about the stock Gagliardi said Dynegys offer for Enron caused a brief rally in Enrons stock price and outlook But that flurry of optimism was halted by a new financial report last week to the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing even more serious debt obligations than the company had previously acknowledged Enron was able to negotiate a threeweek extension on a million note that was coming due this week and finished arrangements on a million line of credit part of a billion infusion it had previously announced However the million obligation disclosed in the SEC filing was a very pointed alert to investors about Enrons growing cash needs Meade said And the new details of Enrons plight in last weeks filing further damaged the credibility of the companys financial reporting Meade said I dont think they have fully restated their earnings There is probably more to come Meade said Enrons board has turned to an outside committee to assess the companys financial condition after acknowledging last month that Enron had overstated earnings by million over the past four years The restatement was caused primarily by accounting decisions that concealed losses in a series of limited partnerships that Enron had helped create to buy various energy water supply and Internet network properties it wanted to dispose of the company said On Nov Enrons new chief financial officer Jeff McMahon briefed analysts on a series of steps the company would take to raise cash including the current quest for million to billion in loans Enron its executives said will reorganize the company around its business that generated the strongest cash flow energy trades gas pipeline and coal operations Other assets worth billion in book value would be put up for sale in an orderly fashion Then came the new disclosures last week reinforcing analysts concerns that the depths of Enrons liabilities have not yet been plumbed The issues that brought Enron to this point are unresolved Its a balance sheet that doesnt stand still and continues to deteriorate Gagliardi said Contact INDIA Enron India unit lenders to meet in UK this week Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Nov Reuters Enron Corps troubled Indian

not be derailed by litigation over Enrons devastated employeeretirement plan The sides were also negotiating ways to tighten clauses in the merger agreement so that Dynegy would not be able to use information from Enrons recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a reason for backing out of the deal Both companies declined to comment on whether renegotiations were taking place But according to executives close to the talks the new terms would lower the ratio of Dynegy stock to be exchanged to roughly share for each share of Enron The original deal announced Nov called for each Enron share to be exchanged for share of Dynegy But Enrons shares have been plunging steadily and yesterday the current offer was valued at percent over Enrons closing price The companies hope that by releasing some good news they can stem the slide in the price of Enrons stock and traded debt Enron shares which have been plunging since midOctober when the company began to disclose a series of losses and accounting errors closed yesterday at down percent or cents Shares of Dynegy closed at yesterday down percent or More important the executives close to the talks said the companies hope to restore confidence in Enrons energytrading operation which showed signs of deterioration yesterday In recent years Enron has traded more natural gas and electricity than its two biggest competitors combined and its trading floor is viewed as its most valuable franchise accounting for most of the companys profit Dynegys biggest worry according to the executives is that this core business is deteriorating The company fears that if other energy traders further curtail their business with Enron either on their own or in response to another cut in Enrons credit rating then much of the value of the company could be wiped out they said The urgency of the situation has been made clear by the way in which Enron is being treated in the energytrading markets some analysts and executives at rival energy companies say Though some large traders are still doing business with Enron many other traders have curtailed their dealings with the company for fear they may not get paid if Enron collapses and files for bankruptcy protection In addition some of the energy trading Enron is doing is costing it more money because of credit concerns For example analysts and energy executives say Enron is in some cases being forced to pay cents to cents more per million British thermal units of natural gas That means instead of paying perhaps per million BTUs in some trades it may be paying Jeff Dietert an analyst with Simmons Company in Houston said the price discrepancies on some trades were also showing up on EnronOnline the Internet platform that accounts for much of the companys trading with other parties Were seeing Enrons prices Mr Dietert said be about a nickel higher on EnronOnline versus some of the competing Internetbased exchanges If these credit premiums should continue it could erode Enrons trading profits and worsen its already tenuous liquidity situation An Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said trading volumes were below average yesterday but she declined to be more specific She did say the company was in discussions about a new equity infusion of million to billion According to executives close to the talks details were still being worked out on the cash infusion which would come from Citigroup and J P Morgan Chase Dynegy may also add cash to the deal while reaffirming the companys commitment to the merger Executives at rival trading companies said Dynegy needed to do something to bolster confidence in Enrons trading operations In places Enron is paying up to or or cents more for nextday gas said an executive at one large energy trader Some producers out there dont want to sell additional discretionary gas to Enron so theyre having to pay up The executive also said most energy traders expected that Dynegy would obtain a much lower merger price because Enron had little or no room to fight a renegotiation If Enron hasnt lined something else up their other choice is bankruptcy he said You can guess what shareholder value is going to look like if thats the case Report US Pipelines a Target FBI warns gas oil firms of vague threat Tom Brune WASHINGTON BUREAU Newsday NASSAU AND SUFFOLK Page A Copyright Newsday Inc Washington According to an unverified intelligence report Osama bin Laden has ordered retaliatory attacks on US natural gas supplies should he or the Talibans leader be killed or captured Attorney General John Ashcroft said yesterday The US oil and natural gas industry confirmed yesterday that it went on a higher stage of alert within the past two weeks after the FBI advised the American Petroleum Institute and other national industry groups of the vague alleged threat On Nov the FBI sent emails to its field offices across the country but not to state and local law enforcement officials about the alleged threat which is being taken seriously although the agency has not determined whether it is credible Justice officials said The notice warned that bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the event he or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was captured or killed The FBI said the information was from a source of undetermined reliability Asked about the notice yesterday Ashcroft said Frankly those are the kinds of reports which we take seriously and we work to elevate our security to alert the interested industry groups to alert law enforcement Ashcroft sought to downplay the threat as an act of retaliation ordered by bin Laden the US governments prime suspect in the Sept attacks and the leader of alQaida terrorist network now being pursued by US forces in Afghanistan I dont believe alQaida operates on the basis of triggering attacks This is an organization motivated by hate Ashcroft said We are at risk not based on our activities but based on their malicious despising of the United States Justice officials said the natural gas threat lacked the verification that led Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller to publicly issue nationwide alerts twice last month The notice about the natural gas threat was one of many the FBI has sent to its field offices for vigilance and communication to those who might be affected a Justice official said The notice of the natural gas threat came after Sen Barbara Mikulski DMd on Nov forced federal regulators to reconsider a permit that would allow the reopening of a liquefied natural gas plant at Cove Point in Maryland She warned that the Cove Point facility is within three miles of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant and the ships carrying liquefied natural gas from Algeria or other countries will be under foreign flag with foreign crews Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the US retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America making protection difficult Aerial monitoring has increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations industry officials who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press Also some detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites Access to facilities has been tightened as well officials said Investors bet Enron deal

Chicago Tribune As Dynegy Inc continued to scrutinize merger partner Enron Corps tangled finances Wall Street traders bet that Dynegy is on the verge of either calling off the Enron buyout it announced three weeks ago or renegotiating a much cheaper price for its once highflying rival The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms said AG Edwards analyst Michael Heim The New York Times reported the companies as early as Tuesday could announce a new deal which could reduce by nearly half Dynegys billion takeover offer Under terms of the original agreement between the two Houston based energy concerns Enron stockholders are to swap each of their shares for little more than a quartershare of Dynegy stock which closed Monday at That would value Enron shares at If investors believed the stockforstock deal was likely to go through they would be willing to pay something very close to that price for Enron sharesbut theyre not As

Dynegy spokesman Were looking closely at Enron Asked about one analysts recent projection that Dynegy may renegotiate the transactions exchange ratio and give Enron holders just Dynegy shares for each Enron share rather than the agreed upon ratio Sousa said We dont comment on speculation There is no shortage of speculation of late in the soap opera that is Enron said commentator Carol Levenson of the Gimme Credit bond market newsletter Levenson suggested that theres a game of chicken going on between Enron its bankers its ostensible merger partner Dynegy and the rating agencies Any of the parties could send this company over the edge at any moment she said and Enron is in an increasingly weak negotiating position Enrons fall from grace has been astonishingly swift and painful for its stockholders some of whom are suing the company for allegedly using misleading accounting measures to conceal the shaky state of its finances With Mondays drop Enron shares have tumbled percent from the they commanded just months ago Once a regional pipeline operator known as Houston Natural Gas Enron transformed itself during the s through an ambitious expansion plan It acquired electric utility operations built overseas power plants and developed an innovative energy trading operation Partnership woes The strategy made Enron a stock market darling but it also periodically strained the companys liquidity To help keep its credit ratings strong the company created limited partnerships that allowed Enron to keep billions of dollars in debt obligations off its books and out of sight of most investors While Enrons power trading group has experienced operating problems of late it is the limited partnershipssome of which were managed by Enron officialsthat proved to be the companys downfall In October Enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by billion to buy back million shares it had issued to the partnerships The charge associated with unwinding the web of partnerships stunned investors by giving the company an unforeseen million thirdquarter loss It also spurred a markdown of Enrons credit ratings to just above junkbond status as well as a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enrons partnership practices As further accounting difficulties surfaced Enrons finances have turned increasingly shaky and some other trading companies fearing exposure to Enrons problems have become reluctant do new transactions with the company As part of the buyout arrangement Dynegys percent owner ChevronTexaco Corp has given Enron billion in

irresponsibility ARLIE SCHARDT Washington Nov Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C Top Companies Issuing Debt At a Fast Pace By STEPHANIE STROM The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company In the weeks since the attack on the World Trade Center bluechip corporations have issued a torrent of debt Ford General Electric IBM Kraft ATT General Motors and other companies have doubled and even trebled their initial plans for bond offerings as investors disenchanted with the stock market have all but begged to buy their debt In all companies have issued percent more debt in the last weeks than they did in the period a year earlier The companies are taking advantage of the chance to raise cash at bargain basement prices thanks to low interest rates and to retire more expensive debt But they may also have littlediscussed concerns that money will be scarce in the future particularly if the economic downturn persists and the recovery is less vigorous than economists now hope Bank lending is at a year low according to the Conference Board and buyers are hard to find for commercial paper the shortterm cheap debt that corporate purebreds rely on Standard Poors says the amount of commercial paper issued by nonfinancial companies has shrunk roughly percent this year Companies now can lock in substantially lower overall borrowing costs said William Cunningham director of credit strategy at J P Morgan They have an opportunity to build a war chest to help them get through the hard times and theyre taking advantage of it Before the terrorist attacks analysts were expecting the issuing of debt to slow late this year after a tremendous first half So much for expectations Ford originally planned to raise billion it was able to raise billion and is said to be thinking about trying to raise billion more Kraft Foods part of the Philip Morris Companies had planned to issue billion worth of bonds Instead it offered billion ATT raised billion twice as much as it originally planned ATTs and Fords issues rank as the second and thirdlargest ever All told corporations have issued billion of debt since Sept compared with companies that raised billion in the period last year according to Thomson FinancialFirst Call When you look at other asset classes the corporate bond market offers some of the better values said Bob LoBue head of the investmentgrade fixedincome syndicate at J P Morgan which has underwritten roughly half the issues that have come to market since Sept Theres still a lack of confidence in stock valuations based on the weakness were seeing in earnings Issuers and their underwriters most often cite the low interest rates on Treasury bills as the reason for the surge in corporate debt Corporate bonds are often priced in relation to United States government debt and thanks to a cascade of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year wellheeled companies can borrow at extremely attractive rates International Business Machines for instance recently sold billion worth of fiveyear notes with the lowest coupon it has ever issued percent Others though read the stampede of premier companies to issue debt as a sign that credit is getting tight Investmentgrade companies typically juggle a smorgasbord of debt short intermediate and long term but they are definitely skewing the mixture toward the long end these days No doubt that is because debt is cheap but it also suggests that they may foresee a time when money will be more scarce and are accumulating the war chests Mr Cunningham referred to It was not so long ago after all that companies experienced a credit shortage A credit crunch was brewing last year Mr Cunningham said until the Fed stepped in and started aggressively lowering interest rates which averted it But a cash problem persists in some ways despite the Federal Reserves series of interest rate cuts We are in a cash crisis like none we have experienced in recent memory said James Padilla a Ford executive in a recent memorandum to his staff Many companies with lessthanpristine credit ratings have trouble raising money and may be having more because of the stampede by bluechip companies When companies like Ford or General Electric come into the market they squeeze a lot of other somewhat riskier credits out said Gail D Fosler the chief economist at the Conference Board Jack Ablin chief investment officer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank said that the economic recovery depended on companies being able to get credit My primary concern is the lack of available credit across the spectrum he said We are forecasting an economic recovery in the middle of next year but the one thing that could go wrong with that forecast is if the availability of credit stays where it is or gets worse Another concern is that debt is piling up with negative consequences The Fed is trying to prevent the bubble from bursting by keeping the forces of credit exuberance alive Barton M Biggs chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley wrote to investors earlier this month The trouble is although it may work in the short run in the long run the debt burden will be bigger and the adjustment process more painful The automakers for example are using the money they have raised in part to support the customer incentive programs that offer zerointerest financing They are paying as much as percent in other words to lend money to car buyers for nothing Some of the new debt is being used to retire commercial paper But companies are taking on more than they need to accomplish that goal The longerterm money they are borrowing is more expensive than the commercial paper even if it is cheaper than it has been in a long time The spread the difference in interest rates between Treasuries and corporate bonds has generally widened since Sept although not across the board There is a cost factor involved but we try to minimize that said David Moore manager of fixedincome investor relations at Ford Credit which accounted for the bulk of the billion that Ford borrowed last month Were mindful of our liquidity and want to make sure we ensure it Like many of the companies issuing debt Ford is curbing its dependence on the commercial paper market For the year through Oct Ford had cut the amount of paper it had outstanding by almost percent to billion That puts us in a very good position given our rating said Mr Moore who was one of the few executives willing to discuss his companys strategy Ford like a host of other companies has had its credit ratings cut Many buyers of commercial paper like money market funds lend to only the highestrated companies So far this year Standard Poors has knocked companies out of the top ratings for commercial paper compared with last year The total amount of outstanding commercial paper has fallen percent this year according to Diane Vazza head of global financial investment research at Standard Poors thanks to that downgrading and to great caution among investors Weve seen some issuers driven out of the market Ms Vazza said According to several credit analysts DaimlerChrysler was scheduled to roll over billion of commercial paper in June but decided to take the offering to Europe where investors are less particular about ratings quality Similarly Enron careered into its crisis when it was forced to redeem commercial paper as its credit ratings fell The decline in ATTs commercial paper ratings was one reason for its big issue last week But underwriters of corporate debt insist that the decline in the commercial paper market has more to do with companies ability to borrow for the long term cheaply than with their inability to issue shortterm debt Shortterm financing does come with a maturity risk in that you constantly have to roll it over in order to maintain liquidity said Mr LoBue of J P Morgan The underwriters concede however that lending by banks has all but dried up falling to its lowest level in three decades Bank lending has been curtailed at the behest of Federal regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury Department putting them seemingly at crosspurposes with the Fed The chief executive of EchoStar Charles W Ergen had to put up billion of his own money to complete the purchase of the Hughes Electronic Corporation The bankers at UBS Warburg EchoStars adviser on the deal had offered to provide the financing but only with a proviso that would have let the bank back out of the deal under certain conditions Although the company later got financing from Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Bank many other bankers have privately applauded UBS Warburgs caution Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Nov Houston Chronicle Enron Dynegy deal back on table Energy traders said to be renegotiating premium for shares By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright Houston Chronicle Dynegy and Enron Corp could announce new terms for Dynegys deal to buy Enron as soon as today according to sources familiar with talks between the two companies The two Houstonbased energy traders the sources said spent the weekend and Monday discussing among other issues a lower exchange rate for Dynegys stock deal to buy Enron As of Monday evening no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussions were continuing the sources said cautioning that the situation was fluid Also Monday Enron and Dynegy the sources said were working to finalize terms for an equity infusion into Enron of around million thats expected to come from JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Another equity infusion from other parties could come later the sources said Enron Dynegy and a group of banks were negotiating terms for a socalled override agreement that would extend until after the merger closed maturity dates for certain debt Enron is due to repay or that could come due before the sources said It was unclear how much of approximately the billion in obligations Enron could have coming due in the next months that would be covered by that restructuring It was expected that Enron would start layoffs sometime this week Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman said her only comment was that any action the company would take concerning job cuts would be communicated first to employees California Attorney General Bill Lockyer not known for harboring a favorable attitude toward Enron or other Texas energy companies has started reviewing the planned merger looking for potential antitrust problems his office said Dynegy has power plants there while Enron sells power and natural gas into the state Shares in both companies fell with Enron closing down cents at while shares in Dynegy ended the day down at The talks between Enron and Dynegy come amid Wall Street expectations that Dynegy will renegotiate the merger terms or back out of the deal completely The sources said that at the moment the companies arent discussing canceling the deal On Nov the day Dynegy announced it would acquire its troubled rival shares in Enron closed at while shares in Dynegy closed at The merger agreement calls for Enron shareholders to get share of Dynegy per Enron share Based on the Nov closing prices Dynegy would be paying a share for Enron But since Enrons share prices have dropped significantly amid increasing concerns about its ability to maintain its core trading business and troubling new disclosures about its financial shape Based on Mondays closing prices Dynegy would be paying more a share for Enron which is worth considerably less based on market capitalization than when the deal was announced Last week one stock analyst said he thought a ratio of no more than share of Dynegy per Enron share might be more realistic Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said Monday that Dynegy was continuing its due diligence review of Enrons books and looking at everything very closely Unless the merger with Dynegy goes through Enron could be forced into bankruptcy protection Enrons core trading business has eroded the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its finances and it faces a pile of debt as well as an increasing number of shareholder and employee lawsuits Enron and Dynegy hoped the merger deal which included an immediate infusion of billion of equity into Enron would stabilize Enron But new financial disclosures have had the opposite effect For example on Nov Enron revealed million in debt would come due sooner than expected because of a creditrating downgrade The news came as a surprise even to Dynegy Dynegy has escape hatches in its merger agreement including a material adverse change clause that applies generally to Enrons financial state Also if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than billion the deal can be called off Sousa described the escape clauses as broad provisions to ensure Dynegy is adequately protected Nov Houston Chronicle Sizable staff of lawyers in merger limbo By MARY FLOOD Copyright Houston Chronicle Whether troubled Enron Corp merges falls or stays the course it is likely to deeply affect one of Houstons largest law offices the one within the embattled company Weve always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston said Howard Ayers managing partner of Andrews Kurth one of the citys largest firms with about lawyers in Houston alone Enron has about lawyers worldwide company spokesman Vance Meyer said Thats a large legal stable even for a company with more than employees With about lawyers in Houston if it were a private firm it would have been the citys sixthlargest according to the Chronicle survey released in May Energy trader Enrons internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge trading firm now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor Dynegy As Enrons stock plummeted further Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy Whatever the companys fate there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed and that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enrons legal staff speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent My guess is theyll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state Theres a lot of legal work to go through said Joel Swanson a senior partner at Baker Botts a Houston law firm with about lawyers here Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company but it also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger for either Enron or Dynegy and others are standing by wondering which outside firms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is created Enrons legal department has siphoned talent from Houstons top law firms over the years Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising lawyers lured away by Enrons competitive pay combined with stock options which were a lucrative draw until recently as shares have lost percent of their value Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country said Jeff Love managing partner of Locke Liddell Sapp a Houstonbased firm with about of its lawyers here Enron has hired a lot of what are called laterals or lawyers who have had a couple years training often at a big firm Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier than bigfirm life thats not the reputation of Enrons legal eagles As with the company itself the general counsels office has been known as innovative and hard driving I dont think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of an ordinary life Ayers said In the Houston market where bigfirm firstyear lawyers start at around a year the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enron were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron top Houston lawyers expect casualties to land on their feet Looming recessions are not always bad for jobhunting lawyers Bankruptcy litigation and mergers all can boom in rough times Several Houstonbased law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger starting class of lawyers for meaning they dont expect to scale back their business in the immediate future Should the merger succeed Enrons lawyers will join Dynegys The question of how you integrate the two staffs as with a lot of things associated with the merger wont be worked out for some time Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said Nov Houston Chronicle Bin Laden threat against pipelines taken seriously Ashcroft Unconfirmed warning linked to leaders death capture By MICHAEL DAVIS Copyright Houston Chronicle The FBI confirmed Monday that it has warned the energy industry that Osama bin Laden may have ordered strikes against US natural gas facilities if he is caught or killed The agency issued the warning last week Attorney General John Ashcroft said at a news conference Monday It had uncorroborated information that bin Laden may have approved plans for such attacks Ashcroft added The FBI warning said such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed The warning hit home in Houston because while the warning did not single out a target it referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines Houston is the hub of this industry and is at the center of a dense web of gas pipelines The warning was considered similar to the one issued earlier about potential attacks against West Coast bridges Ashcroft said the government is in regular communication with companies that own the nations energy infrastructure such as refineries natural gas pipelines and nuclear plants Federal law enforcement officials received the uncorroborated report of undetermined reliability about a potential attack against natural gas supplies about days ago Ashcroft said Since the terrorist attacks on Sept all energy companies have established more stringent security measures Pipelines however are considered especially vulnerable since they are accessible above ground in remote areas with typically little more than a padlock and a metal fence to keep out someone wanting to damage the line Reliant Energy Entex the natural gas distribution company that serves the Houston area was notified about the warning but has not added any new security measures as a result company spokeswoman Alicia Dixon said Weve been on a heightened state of alert since Sept so nothing is different today than it was yesterday Dixon said We have very strong security in place already because of the nature of our business We have to be prepared to deal with a variety of emergencies Dixon said the company recieved word of the warning from the American Gas Association The American Petroleum Institute also passed the warning on to energy companies API spokesman Juan Palomo said Enron notified its employees of the warning and also has been on heightened state of alert since Sept company spokeswoman Gina Taylor said We take all threats seriously Taylor said Enron monitors its pipelines and related facilities such as compression stations using planes cars and on foot she said The company has not added staff to beef up its security as a result of the warning she said We routinely patrol the right of way she said There are thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines running throughout the nation Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry percent of the natural gas transported according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America Detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites Access to facilities has been tightened as well officials said Federal regulators have offered help to pay for the added protection by speeding rate hike requests for beefedup security If a pipeline were attacked with an explosive for example the operator could shut off the flow of natural gas oil or refined products from either side of the break Nov Houston Chronicle Current recession differs from others By JIM BARLOW Copyright Houston Chronicle So its official The United States is in a recession That was the word Monday from the National Bureau of Economic Research A recession by the by comes about after six months of declining economic activity In this case the bureau said the recession started last March so were already through almost nine months of slowdown But theres something very different about this recession different from all the others weve experienced in the past four or five decades We were not led into it by a huge oversupply of all kinds of real estate and a collapse in those prices The current recession was sparked by a hightech collapse led by a glut of technology products That doesnt mean real estate will sail through untouched this recession There are places that will be hurting San Francisco comes to mind It is a hightech center and there was a lot of building to accommodate that industry There is also one real estate sector in trouble the hotel industry It had already been hurt by a downturn in business travel The Sept terrorist attacks sent it and air travel reeling Recall seethrough buildings But theres nothing like we saw back in the mids Remember when Houston enriched the nations vocabulary by coming up with the term seethrough buildings Those were the many skyscrapers in Houston that had been built but never finished inside So you could look right through them because there were no interior walls Indeed if real estate is a bright spot in this recession real estate in Houston is a great shining light Houstons office building market is tight The downtown office market has an percent vacancy rate and prime Class A space prized by major corporations is effectively full There should be some easing of that rate Enron Corp with its wellpublicized freefall has almost completed a new headquarters Even more space will be coming onto the market when the story Calpine Center office tower is completed at Texas Ave in Century Development has announced it is working on a story office tower downtown Crescent Real Estate Equities is building a tower on the other side of Main Street All this plus cutbacks at Continental Airlines and the pending sale of Compaq Computer Corp to HewlettPackard Co will doubtless hurt the office market But no one is predicting disaster The Houston apartment market may be the nations healthiest with percent of Houstons apartments occupied in the third quarter of this year That figure is almost a full percentage point higher than the year before Prices for apartments are up as are rents Sales of used homes in October were the highest ever with the median price up percent Newhome sales are setting records Developers are optimists So how did we escape the usual Credit lenders Real estate developing is full of optimists Ask any developer even in the midst of a bust and hell tell you It wont affect his building which somehow is nicer sexier or even more depressionproof than the next guys Give a developer money and he will build Lenders have been as tight as the bark on trees That has forced developers to prelease buildings and seek partners with equity primarily pension funds before the banks would loan them money for new projects Several things happen to the real estate business during a recession Prices fall or stabilize and in this particular recession the bet is probably on stabilization The banks and others that loan that money generally tighten credit standards cutting off weaker real estate players And the Federal Reserve Board helps out the economy by lowering rates which aids bargain hunters with deep pockets In any recession even one that is as benign to real estate as this one some properties wont survive the economic downturn and owners will have to sell or file for bankruptcy With the current low interest rates companies with good credit will move in and buy those properties Remember the socalled vulture funds of the s How soon this process starts will determine the length of this recession Because real estate is in good shape this time the process is not as important as it was in the s Still if investors promptly snap up distressed properties that will increase the odds that this recession will be a short one

companies discussed possible changes in the terms over the weekend people familiar with the matter said yesterday Dynegy is now talking about paying less than shares for each of Enrons valuing the companys equity at about billion or less than per share the Wall Street Journal reported citing people close to the discussions The choices are fairly stark Renegotiate the deal or file for Chapter said John Olson an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris a Houstonbased financial services company Enron shares rose as much as cents to on Instinet The original Dynegy bid valued Enron at a share in Dynegy stock The discount reflects skepticism among investors the acquisition will be completed under the original terms Bond investors were less optimistic The companys percent bonds that mature in declined to cents on the dollar from cents on the dollar yesterday traders said At that price the bonds yield percent The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down said Paul Tice cohead of US highgrade credit research who covers the energy market for Deutsche Bank Last weeks Securities and Exchange Commission filing had a lot of negative surprises Investors have become concerned because Enron hasnt been able to complete a proposal to raise billion through a private equity sale and Moodys Investors Service is weighing whether to downgrade the companys credit rating Extension The companies may announce as early as today an extension by some banks on the repayment of Enrons debt a million cash infusion from Citigroup Inc and JP Morgan Chase Co and an agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite lawsuits over Enrons employeeretirement plan the New York Times said Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout agreement are underway Current terms call for an exchange ratio of share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share Given recent disclosures about Enrons debt and the drop in the stock price a fairer ratio would be share of Dynegy said Ronald Barone a UBS Warburg analyst who rates Dynegy a strong buy If they can renegotiate the deal to half the original price thats where you get really attractive earnings said Gordon Howald an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a buy Enrons Debt Under current terms the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if Enron earns cents or more Howald said Barone has reduced his estimate of Enrons earnings from a share to cents Dynegy shares fell or percent to yesterday New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the additional billion in financing its seeking some investors said If people whove looked at Enron are willing to put in that kind of money it sends a message that their core businesses trading pipelines and energy management are still sound said Kathleen Vuchetich who helps manage billion in assets in the Strong Utilities Fund percent of which is Dynegy stock Enron has debt payments of more than billion due before the end of and has less than billion in cash and credit lines left the company said in a filing last week If its cash reserves run too low Enrons credit rating may be cut below investment grade That would trigger billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships Reprieve Moodys Investors Service hasnt issued a report on Enron since the company filed a Q quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week On Nov it rated Enrons debt one notch above junk The rating companys analysts didnt return calls seeking comment EganJones Ratings Co lowered its rating on Enrons credit today to BB from BB a level below investment grade The Houstonbased company also said in the filing that it had a million note due this week and that it may have to reduce fourthquarter earnings by million The writeoff would come because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated partnership and the value of that stock has plunged On Wednesday Enron got a threeweek reprieve from lenders on the million note and closed on a million credit line Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was encouraged by the developments Enron is negotiating to restructure its other

but Dynegy Will Suffer Too By Peter Eavis mailto Senior Columnist TheStreetcom PM EST URL marketsdetoxhtml In the Enron ENENYSE news commentary endgame both players look set to lose The other player is energy trader Dynegy DYNNYSE news commentary which this month agreed to buy Enron Since the deal was announced Enrons fundamentals have rapidly deteriorated making Dynegys offer look ridiculously generous But even if the deal gets done at more advantageous terms Dynegy will struggle to revive a disembowled Enron and absorb its hefty debt load Making matters worse Dynegy could suffer just as much if it backs out of the deal Without a merger Houstonbased Enron almost certainly goes to the wall causing disruption stress and profitsapping change in the energy market How can Dynegy not get wounded in that environment The stock market doesnt seem to agree however Dynegy shares remain above their predeal levels Wishful Thinking A Dynegy spokesman says his company can post annual earnings growth of to over the next two years even without Enron He declined to comment on the merger negotiations except to say that Dynegy is continuing its due diligence of Enron An Enron spokesman declined to comment on deal talks Where do things stand as of Monday evening Well the deal looks increasingly unlikely to happen at least on the terms of Nov After a sickening slide last week Enron tanked again Monday dropping to Current deal terms have Dynegy paying around an Enron share based on its current stock price A gap says the deal wont get done But as the world and his wife now know the deal needs to go through for Enron to maintain the investment grade credit rating necessary for its survival Clearly every hour counts in this fastunwinding situation Enrons core trading business is in deep trouble as power market players cut exposure to the company draining it of precious cash As a result two options exist from here The first is a rescue effort involving Dynegy the rating agencies and bank creditors like JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup working to revise the merger agreement and find more cash to buy Enron time This could involve changing the stockswap ratio to give Dynegy a cheaper price with the banks possibly extending debt and joining with other investors to inject equity The other scenario has Dynegy after seeing the cash hemorrhage and the skeletons in the closet deciding to back out altogether leaving Enron with no rescuer and no future But Dynegys resilient stock price suggests that the market hasnt grasped the impact an Enron bankruptcy would have on Dynegy and other trading firms Dont be at all surprised if any moment now we see one last attempt to salvage Dynegys rescue merger with new terms Several banks are exposed to Enron and presumably they will try almost anything including extending debt to keep the company afloat By keeping deeply distressed Enron at an investmentgrade rating rating agencies such as Moodys have shown themselves willing to bend to the banks wishes so they will probably capitulate again if pressured by bank honchos Be Careful What You Wish For But swallowing Enron would hardly be good for Dynegy which appears to have underestimated the formers problems Amazingly just a couple of weeks back the company expected Enron to make per share in Goldman Sachs is now expecting cents even if the merger gets done If Dynegy ended up paying say a share for Enron people would no doubt hail that as a lowenough price to cover worsened fundamentals legal liabilities and any nasty surprises that could spring from Enrons notoriously murky books But recall that Dynegy also would be taking on Enrons billion of debt Include the debt in some returnoncapital calculations and the deal still looks untenable Alternatively Enron may be deteriorating too fast to save Thats also bad for Dynegy The damage done to the company by depleted energy market activity has been recognized as has the risk that an Enron collapse could leave Dynegy dangerously unhedged on many of its trades What does that mean and why is it dangerous Lets say Dynegy agreed to buy power from Company X over a period of time and then sell it to Enron If Enron goes down its obligation to buy from Dynegy obviously disappears but Dynegy cant easily back out of the commitment to buy power from Company X And theres another potential risk that the market really hasnt recognized Enron allegedly was very aggressive in booking upfront profits on forward market deals An Enron spokesman declined to comment on that allegation Those deals had to be done with other trading houses possibly Dynegy In other words Enrons ways may have contaminated the whole market because as we are frequently told Enron was the energy market just as Drexel Burnham was the junk bond market in the s In Enrons absence many of the aggressive deals may have to be unwound Meanwhile auditors in a frantic bid to cover their behinds would start telling trading companies to be a lot more conservative in how much profit they book on forward deals Suddenly fat margin deals evaporate and earnings estimates get slashed Checkmate for both sides IN THE MONEY Another Sign Investors Dont Trust Enron Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This column was first published Monday By Michael Rapoport A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp ENE heres another piece of evidence one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the companys stock Enron doesnt simply trade for less than its book value it fell below that milestone weeks ago No now it trades for less than ONETHIRD of its book value Thats a rare level for a company of Enrons size and prominence And it may mean among other things that investors have decided that they simply cant place any further faith in the veracity of Enrons earnings and balancesheet figures muchrevised as theyve been something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly First lets be clear about what this means Enron stock is currently about a share the companys reported book value is about a share In other words Enron stock sells for less than onethird of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate were to turn all its assets into cash pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give whats left over to shareholders This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company even a troubled one For comparisons sake Dynegy Inc DYN which has agreed to buy Enron trades at about three times book value as does El Paso Corp EPG a competitor of both companies In fact Enron has the secondlowest pricetobook ratio of any company in the Standard Poors stock index only Conseco Inc CNC another troubled company is lower by an eyelash Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegys agreement to buy Enron will fall apart and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does in which case Enron shareholders would be hardpressed to realize any value The Dynegy deal now amounts to about per Enron share itself well under Enrons book value the huge premium that level offers over Enrons current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal wont be consummated in its current form But given Enrons current woes its certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors dont feel they can trust the earnings and balancesheet numbers coming out of Enron Those numbers after all are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron or any other company by computing figures like pricetobook and pricetoearnings ratios And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted In terms of those numbers the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships when it restated nearly five years worth of earnings downward by a total of million and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a million note That deadline has now been extended until Dec When youve gotten punched in the face three times its not unreasonable to fear therell be a fourth blow no matter how much the puncher assures you there wont be Given Enrons insanely complicated structure and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks who can guarantee there arent more such shocks yet to come Thats what investors appear to be fearing and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously Thanks to Enrons repeated demonstrations that its numbers cant be relied on investors no longer have a firm trustworthy basis on which to value the stock And so not surprisingly the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative bareminimum level An Enron spokesman couldnt be reached for comment Its ironic in a way For a long time it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher Now its hard to properly value Enron because the companys attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that its hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy By Michael

information Were only speaking in terms of day rolling averages Its not fair to speak in terms of daily because of d aily volatility Thode said Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enrons trading to restore confidence But after Enrons ability to tr ansact took a severe turn for the worse Nov Dynegy said that the compa nies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month as conce rns about its finances precipitated a drop in its stock price and

SMARTMONEYCOM Common Sense Joining The Deal Dance By James B Stewart Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Of SMARTMONEYCOM I KNOW ITS been hard but if youve been able to divert yourself from the amazing news out of Afghanistan this past week you may have noticed some i mportant merger stories trouble in the Compaq Computer CPQ HewlettPack ard HWP deal Dynegys DYN bid for Enron ENE and on Monday the ann ouncement of Phillips Petroleums P proposed merger with Conoco COC to create the worlds sixthlargest oil company The PhillipsConoco merger is an excellent example of what economists call horizontal integration the merger of two companies in the same business in this case oil and gas As an investor I love these combinations even though as a citizen Im often troubled by antitrust concerns Investors who engage in whats called merger arbitrage or risk arbitrage which gained fame and notoriety in the s tend to sell stock in the acquiring compan y and buy the stock of the company being acquired Though theyre far less conspicuous now risk arbitrageurs play a prominent role in many hedge fun ds The strategy is appealing to many portfolio managers because returns ar e determined less by overall movement in the market than by the circumstanc es of particular deals Successful riskarbitrage hedge funds typically ear n to a year in good markets and bad Individual investors can do some risk arbitrage of their own simply by buy ing stock in a company being acquired and hoping the deal goes through Bec ause of the risk that it wont either because of regulatory hurdles or mar ket reaction these stocks usually trade at a discount to the acquisition price But few investors are willing to commit the time and resources to ke ep up with every twist in these deals let alone investing in enough of the m to have a reasonably diversified portfolio I know I dont Instead for longterm investors I often recommend buying the stock of the acquiring company In this latest instance that would be Phillips In simi lar circumstances I have had good luck buying Exxon after it launched its bid for Mobil to form Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron after it acquired Texa co to become ChevronTexaco CVX Their stocks were down on the news but l ater recovered handsomely as they began to benefit from costcutting and ec onomies of scale not to mention reduced competition Even if the deal fail s you arent stuck owning a stock that was bid up only because a deal was announced Honeywell HON investors will know only too well what I mean I still consider it outrageous that the European Community blocked General E lectrics GE acquisition of Honeywell but when the deal fell through GE investors were glad they had bought the acquiring company rather than the target So far the PhillipsConoco deal is unusual in that both stocks rose slight ly after the merger was announced which suggests that other investors have caught on to the same phenomenon Ive noticed But even without a builtin merger premium Im enthusiastic about the energy sector True oil stocks have dropped further since I last recommended them before the calamitous events of Sept With talk of an outandout price war breaking out and dire predictions of abarrel oil its no wonder But its exactly when prospects in the oil patch look their worst that its the time to buy thes e stocks If there is indeed a global economic recovery next year as seems ever more likely oil prices will rise So I recommend Phillips both as a merger play and as a timely investment in the energy sector Which brings me to Enron Im glad I warned readers away from this former h ighflying naturalgas pipeline and energytrading concern since its stock continued to fall precipitously until the takeover bid emerged from Dynegy This isnt exactly a horizontal merger since Dynegy isnt a big factor i n energy trading but it will combine the two companies pipelines and natu ralgas holdings The market reaction to this deal was very unusual since shares of Dynegy the acquiring company jumped on the news Enron move d up just This is the opposite of whats supposed to happen but then nothing about Enron has been typical The market seems to be saying that it likes the deal but doubts it will go through a prospect enhanced by the large breakup fee Dynegy will enjoy if its horrified by what it discovers in Enrons stillmysterious books Personally Im sitting this one out bu t there may be an arbitrage opportunity in Enron for risktolerant investor s If the deal goes through and I think it will Enron shareholders will receive share of Dynegy for each share of Enron Thats worth over a share at current prices yet Enron closed Tuesday at just down after a warning from the company that its falling credit ratings are start ing to rattle its financial structure So while Enrons position is becomin g increasingly precarious this deal could make for a nice return And its still potentially a very good bet for Dynegy one that will add to its na turalgas reserves and vault it into the front ranks of energy traders ass uming it can hold on to Enrons talented but now disgruntled employees Fin ally theres the spectacle of the founding Hewlett and Packard families tu rning against HPs proposed acquisition of Compaq on the grounds that prop osed economies of scale read layoffs run counter to the spirit of the c ompanys founders who treasured employee loyalty and apparently never fire d anyone except for cause The dissidents acknowledged that they have littl e or no business and managerial experience themselves although they are re presented on HPs board Forgive me if I seem impatient with these benefic iaries of extravagant wealth and trust funds but this reasoning is absurd However much we might sympathize with their concern for employee wellbein g the directors of a modern corporation must balance employees needs with those of other constituencies especially the shareholders Otherwise a c ompany will suffer far more dire consequences including bankruptcy or a fo rced sale in which far more people will lose their jobs than in any merger related layoffs I have already expressed my muted enthusiasm for the propo sed HPCompaq merger That the deal was even proposed is a sad commentary on how far the fortunes of these oncegreat companies have fallen That sai d the merger still makes sense and its far better for shareholders than if the companies are forced to continue in their respective downward spiral s I owned both stocks until last week when I sold my small position in Co mpaq I did this primarily to realize a tax loss more on taxloss selling next week but also because I wouldnt want to own it if the deal falls th rough Im holding on to my larger position in HP I think the deal will b e completed despite the melodrama of family opposition Eventually I beli eve both stocks will benefit and patient investors might want to buy one o r both companies on any weakness Reasons for Thankfulness The stunn ing success of the Northern Alliance and the American military mission in A fghanistan has been an amazing story this past week Who will soon forget t he accounts of newly liberated Afghans digging up their TV sets casting of f their veils and celebrating their freedom from Taliban oppression The im plications of this success are profound and in my view extremely positive Economists are already scaling back their estimates for total cost of thi s war Oil prices are plunging The effect is that of a significant tax cut and just when the economy needs it The capture of Osama bin Laden seems only a matter of time which means the world may soon be a safer place The promise of greater stability in the Middle East has never seemed more tant alizing Is it a paradox that as a calamitous nears an end I feel more thankfu l than I have in years filled with a far greater bounty of peace and prospe rity Perhaps not I hope this

wouldbe suitor and savior Dynegy Inc DYN are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enrons fate And so far even professional arbitrageurs who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through continue for the most part to stay clear of Enrons stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrou nding the once mighty energy trader Still reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revise d down to below from has some hedge funds often willing to ta ke more risks looking to place trades on the deal Were trying to figure out a good play said a trader at a New York hedge fund So far bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a comb ination of stock and debt trading somehow hedging a short position on Enro ns shares with a long position in some of its bonds People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it a hedge fund manager at another fund said This manager added Were still trying to evaluate different riskreward scenario on the debt and equ ity sides Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing the m later by purchasing them at a lower price Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer while taking long positions in the stock of the target company But there is nothing typical about Enrons financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market Some bids are coming in especially on the lower priced bonds s aid a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enr ons bonds Enron bonds which had fallen in value in recent

were recently trading at about cents on the dollar up from cents Monday Under the original terms of the deal Enron holders would have gotten of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares Quoting people close to the discussions The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new rati o is expected to be less than share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswir es story last Friday At current prices a exchange ratio would value E nron at less than a share Essentially this new value if true means that it has now become easier fo r hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at a share risked losing more tha n if the merger went through at the ratio it now stands to lose only a share based on the value of Enron stock under the new ra tio At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potenti al by going long on Enron bonds If the merger doesnt happen Enron is see n by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at stand to benefit by that amoun t Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value o f Enron bonds at about cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about cents on the dollar if it goes through Meanwhile the value of Enron s tock is capped at about a share if the merger goes through with a new co nversion ratio of A lot of the guys are still very skeptical said a bond trader at a New Y ork bank But this is really making the hedge trade easier and weve seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds Still this type of bets isnt for the faint of heart and most investors a re likely to wait for more news before taking a

regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good position for the longterm he said His fund liquidated its Enron holdings completely in mid to lateOctober Enron was the leader in energy trading and its clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot to take up the mantle Hilton pointed to Enrons Q filed last Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the falling share price as potential triggers of the deals material adverse affect clause Those two things could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger If that happens Hilton said an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the few that could make something out of it Hilton said If Dynegy can restore confidence in Enrons trading business and

overstated earnings by million over the past four years While the companies have not said the merger is off investors dont believ e it will happen at least not at the stated price they have bid Enron sha res down to the point where the company has a market value of less than billion The shares closed yesterday at down from a year ago The situation is in flux as it has been for months During that

companys shares sol d as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm Enron was famous for being famous Before the start of the baseball se ason it purchased the rights to have its name on Houstons new ballpark B y Enron Field may need a new name The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy but i t means nothing At the time the company was formed from the merger of Inte rNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas the idea was to call the company E nteron But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Ent eron means intestines they decided to drop the te in the middle and go with Enron Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy a much smaller company in te rms of revenue If the deal falls apart it may want to go back to Enteron Merger Traders
