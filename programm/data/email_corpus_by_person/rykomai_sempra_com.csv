service firm in New York state that asked Dow to reformulate an insulation polyurethane foam product that they marketed The new product had a pressure of up to psi and a retarded set time Both factors allowed better fill of pipe being abandoned Dow and UPSCO seem to have partnered on this product In addition here is the MSDS for the product The exposure of employees is negligible however since there are tight fitting connections to the pipe being filled Attached is also a photo of nozzles used Ralph Komai Ralph Y Komai PhD Sempra Energy Principal Environmental Specialist Phone FAX Pager

Fernandez David F TPDFF Zubiate Armando TPAXZ Padleschat Joyce Alex Barrios Carey Downs John Groot Meraz Delia TPDXM William Huleis William Jollie Subject Comments to UPSCO Inc Dan I have copied your questions and have responded in capital letters Please realize that this is my reaction as of today and that may change as we gain experience with the Froth Paks Did we meet your expectations YES YOU MET MY EXPECTATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR PRODUCT MY EXPECTATIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION THAT I OBSERVED IN ALBANY WHAT I WANTED TO ASSESS WAS ACTUAL USE IN THE FIELD THE NECESSITY TO HAVE A TIGHT FITTING CONNECTION TO THE SERVICE AND WHETHER THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO USING THIS PRODUCT THE TIME REQUIRED TO SET UP AND THE OVERALL REACTION OF OPERATING MANAGEMENT AND FIELD CREWS THE REACTION TO THE PRODUCT WAS VERY POSITIVE Do we have any challenges that need to be addressed COST IS A BIG ONE IF WE CAN FILL SERVICES I BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS JOHN CAHILLS GUESS FOR FOOT SERVICES PER FROTH PAK AT A COST OF THAT HAS A UNIT ABANDONMENT COST OF COMPARED WITH THE WE ARE SPENDING FOR AN AEROSOL CAN CLEARLY THE FROTH PAK FILLS THE SERVICES OVER LONGER DISTANCES CONSISTENTLY RAPIDLY AND MORE RELIABLY AS JOHN CAHILL AND I DISCUSSED INCREASED SALES WILL BRING THE COST DOWN IT MAY BE PREMATURE BUT WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OF HOW COST MAY VARY WITH INCREASED DEMAND HOW MANY UNITS DO YOU HAVE TO SELL TO TRIGGER A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IS PRICE THERE WAS AN INDICATION THAT PALLETS OF WOULD HAVE A QUANTITY DISCOUNT BUT WHAT IS THAT DISCOUNTED PRICE OF A PALLET THERE MAY BE A MIDDLE GROUND FOR US OF USING CANS FOR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE FROTH PAK FOR OTHERS THE TWO PAKS THAT WERE LEFT FOR OUR USE WILL PROVIDE US SOME USEFUL HANDSON EVALUATION OPPORTUNITIES SHELFLIFE AFTER THE CYLINDERS ARE OPENED THE DAY LIFE MAY NOT ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY USE UP REAGENTS WE ARE A LARGE TERRITORY COMPANY SHARING OF PAKS BETWEEN DISTRICTS WOULD MEAN TRAVEL TIME TO TAKE KITS FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT ON THE OTHER HAND INDIVIDUAL PAKS FOR EACH DISTRICT MAY MEAN GREATER WASTED REAGENTS Where do we go from here FOR OUR COMPANY THE FIRST STEP IS TO DEVELOP A SURVEY FORM THAT WE WILL USE FOR THE CREWS THE DRAFT FORM IS UNDER REVIEW WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALLY SUCCESSES UNDER VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE REACTION OF THE FIELD CREWS AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING ANY PROBLEM SITUATIONS WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE AVERAGE COST PER SERVICE THE TWO KITS WILL BE USED IN TWO DIFFERENT REGIONS AND THE INFORMATIONEXPERIENCE WILL BE EXAMINED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS COSTS WILL BE CALCULATED THEN WE WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE NEED TO PILOT THIS SOME MORE OR WE WOULD PREFER TO STAY WITH OUR PRESENT METHODS OR IF WE WISH TO IMPLEMENT USE OF YOUR PRODUCT FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS JOHN CAHILL WILL BE PROVIDING US INFORMATION REGARDING LANDFILLING APPROVAL FOR PRODUCT FOAM AND DEPLETED REAGENT PRESSURE CONTAINERS ANDY BOOS WILL BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NOZZLECONNECTORS TO CAREY DOWNS BECAUSE OF THE SHORTER AVERAGE LENGTH ABANDONMENTS IN HIS REGION One of the thoughts that we are currently evaluating and would greatly appreciate your input on is the following Based upon all of our field work we believe that it may be advantageous to under fill the cylinders of chemical board feet to and in turn increase the amount of propellant from psi to psi In our opinion this would serve three functions Reduce potential material waste Reduce any potential confusion associated with using a kit multiple times Reduce the cost per foot factors and the acquisition price What do you think THIS APPROACH WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT WASTED REAGENT FOR USING THE KIT AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS THERE IS PROBABLY A NEED TO TRACK HOW MANY ABANDONMENTS OF WHAT DIAMETER AND LENGTH IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY ADDITIONAL LINES YOU CAN FILL TOWARD THE END OF A KIT THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO FILL A LINE OR NOT CAN YOU SWITCH PAKS WHEN ONE RUNS OUT IF YOU DO IT WITHIN MINUTES OF THE INJECTION START TIME OF THE FIRST KIT OTHERWISE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH RUNNING OUT OF REACTANTS WHEN YOUVE SQUIRTED IN LESS THAN ENOUGH FOR OF THE VOLUME THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH DECIDING WHAT PERCENTAGE YOU HAVE FILLED WHEN YOU RUN OUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE COST PER FOOT WOULD GO UP WITH UNDERFILLED CYLINDERS SINCE THE FIXED COST IS THE SAME FOR CYLINDERS HOSES TRIGGER AND CARDBOARD BOX YOU WOULD STILL GET THE SAME NUMBER OF BOXES ON A PALLET BUT YOUD FILL FEWER LINES WITH THAT PALLET FEWER FILLS AND CHEAPER PAKS WOULD HOWEVER ALLOW US TO PURCHASE MORE AND DISTRIBUTE THEM MORE WIDELY THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE TRAVEL TIME TO DELIVER SHARED PAKS I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE FEEDBACK IS FROM THE OPERATING REGIONS AFTER THEY PILOT THE PAKS BEFORE WE GIVE YOU OUR MEASURED OPINION ON THE UNDERFILL CONCEPT THATS ALL OF MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT REACTION FOR NOW THANKS FOR THE EVALUATION OPPORTUNITY Ralph Komai
