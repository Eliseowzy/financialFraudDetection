explains the sources for her data which she puts on EnronOnline every day As best I know Mark we dont have any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online Im not too concerned about the weather its from the Canadian and American governments but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from Telerate We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data saying that its our reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site their own site which can be accessed through a password only but I think this proves rather than refutes the fact that were redistributing their data without a right to do so The same applies for Teleratewe dont even give them recognitionwe just post their numbers on our site I know youre a busy man and Im sure youre dealing with things like lawsuits against Enron by South American governments or something like that but this issue should a be dropped because you believe that its really not that important or b resolved becuase you think it is Please tell me how I can help or if we should let this issue drop If I dont hear from you Ill assume that you dont think its an important issue Thanks Jay Forwarded by

think that anything he produced was sent to you He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond who wrote back saying that he didnt know anything either but that I should contact Rahil Jafry The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil and Im trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with him So could you tell me exactly where you get your information from for the following items Canadian Weather Forecasts day forecast for cities NGTL Pipeline Data Prior day deliveries etc US Natural Gas Stastics Gas in Storage Cumulative Heating Degree Days Even if you dont

Please tell me if you think the following summary should be modifiedor if its incorrect Its my understanding that theres a current interest in sports news ie NCAA Finals or the European equivalent as well as a future one It seems that the present interest in European sports news could be met with a patchwork solution of taking public domain sports scores hence my email to Arfan and posting them with occasional updateslike the NCAA scores hence Amitas email to me In the future phase we will have constant automatically updated sports scores as well as other news for which we will have a legal arrangement handled in Houston that will allow us to carry content globallyand all of these deals must be handled by you and Dave Samuels in Houston hence your email to Amita I think Louises concern now referring to Amitas email to me was that European sportsbefore the phase launchshould have just as much of an opportunity to be covered as American ones which is why Amita has had Anna Gardiner and now Arfan look for news that we could put on the site So for example we should have Wimbledon scores online phase or not even if we have no other way to post them than through a patchwork solution Hope this helps but perhaps its already clear in everyones mind Thanks Rahil Jay To Amita CT cc James CT Arfan CT David CT Mark CT Julie CT Anna CT Dave CT Subject Re Sports News on the web page We will soon be receiving International sports news through our deal with Reuters We have also started exploring various options with Sportscom via CBS about getting their content on EnronOnline Please

goverened by the Agreement weve negotiated with them as overseen by Mark on the Houston legal team Regards Rahil Amita Gosalia PM To James CT cc Arfan CT David CT Rahil CT Mark CT Julie CT Anna CT Subject Re Sports News on the web page Hi James My understanding of Louises request was that several sports news pages would be posted with sports scores being updated on the website during the week for intra week events Please clarify Will the content provider provide info about European and Asian sports Do we need to involve JustinEdmund to get the European legal perspective or does the content deal cover this already You will have seen the sports which held the most interest for the traders here can you let us know whether the content provider has sufficient info to enable us to post score data Regards Amita James Bruce To Arfan CT cc David CT Rahil CT Mark CT Julie CT Amita CT Anna CT Subject Re Sports News on the web page Dear Arfan Thanks for all your effort Were working on a content deal that will give us as much sports news as we want Until we can launch this second phase of EnronOnline well have to rely on other third party content for general news items as in Europe As best I understand it this occasional news will be placed on the site at our discretionJulie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American content and Im responsible for European content So if theres something on that everyones talking about Football then we could publish a news item if wed like As for the legal issue I spoke with Mark Taylor lawyer for Enron North America over a month ago and he correct me if Im wrong Mark seemed to differentiate between public domain content and proprietary content the difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the information from any other source I think sports scores is usually in the public domain category So lets keep up the good work and if you want to prepare a possible football related news item lets move towards publishing it always going through the normal channels of course Thanks Arfan Jay Enron London EOL Product Control Group Sent by Arfan Aziz To James CT cc Anna CT Enron London EOL Product

already clear in everyones mind Thanks Rahil Jay To Amita CT cc James CT Arfan CT David CT Mark CT Julie CT Anna CT Dave CT Subject Re Sports News on the web page We will soon be receiving International sports news through our deal with Reuters We have also started exploring various options with Sportscom via CBS about getting their content on EnronOnline Please make sure all the content related discussions are held with both Dave Samuels and myself as wed like to avoid having patchwork solutions for the site Also all content we receive via Reters will be goverened by the Agreement weve negotiated with them as overseen by Mark on the Houston legal team Regards Rahil Amita Gosalia PM To James CT cc Arfan CT David CT Rahil CT Mark CT Julie CT Anna CT Subject Re Sports News on the web page Hi James My understanding of Louises request was that several sports news pages would be posted with sports scores being updated on the website during the week for intra week events Please clarify Will the content provider provide info about European and Asian sports Do we need to involve JustinEdmund to get the European legal perspective or does the content deal cover this already You will have seen the sports which held the most interest for the traders here can you let us know whether the content provider has sufficient info to enable us to post score data Regards Amita James Bruce To Arfan CT cc David CT Rahil CT Mark CT Julie CT Amita CT Anna CT Subject Re Sports News on the web page Dear Arfan Thanks for all your effort Were working on a content deal that will give us as much sports news as we want Until we can launch this second phase of EnronOnline well have to rely on other third party content for general news items as in Europe As best I understand it this occasional news will be placed on the site at our discretionJulie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American content and Im responsible for European content So if theres something on that everyones talking about Football then we could publish a news item if wed like As for the legal issue I spoke with Mark Taylor lawyer for Enron North America over a month ago and he correct me if Im wrong Mark seemed to differentiate between public domain content and proprietary content the difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the information from any other source I think sports scores is usually in the public domain category So lets keep up the good work and if you want to prepare a possible football related news item lets move towards publishing it always going through the normal channels of course Thanks Arfan Jay Enron London EOL Product Control Group Sent by Arfan Aziz To James CT cc Anna CT Enron London EOL Product

explains the sources for her data which she puts on EnronOnline every day As best I know Mark we dont have any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online Im not too concerned about the weather its from the Canadian and American governments but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from Telerate We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data saying that its our reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site their own site which can be accessed through a password only but I think this proves rather than refutes the fact that were redistributing their data without a right to do so The same applies for Teleratewe dont even give them recognitionwe just post their numbers on our site I know youre a busy man and Im sure youre dealing with things like lawsuits against Enron by South American governments or something like that but this issue should a be dropped because you believe that its really not that important or b resolved becuase you think it is Please tell me how I can help or if we should let this issue drop If I dont hear from you Ill assume that you dont think its an important issue Thanks Jay Forwarded by James BruceLONECT on To James CT cc Candace CT Terri CT Ross CT Rahil CT Daniel CT Frank L CT Sheri CT Matt CT Lucy CT Subject Re EnronOnline Newsticker Jay In your original email attached below you requested my source of US Nat Gas Stats that are posted as a newsticker item on the website Please note I would have been more than happy to provide you with source details on the Canadian Weather Forecasts and NGTL Pipeline Data if it was part of your original request US Natural Gas Statistics Gas in Storage Cumulative Heating Degree Days My source is the Producer Newsletter distributed by the MidMarketing Department Ross Prevatt Dan Diamond are both part of that team For your convenience Ive attached a copy for your records The Producer Newsletter is distributed on a weekly basis Monday nights or Tuesday morning and is faxed the MidMarketing Department gets those numbers from several different sources I called Ross again today to reverify He confirmed the following for me Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross Her source is National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration web address grrwfolocathtm Should you require any additional details and need to make contact with Ross again I did take the liberty of explaining who you are the group you represent as well as why you were needing this information I am sure he will be fully receptive and understand the nature of your question should you need to contact him again Canadian Weather Forecasts day forecast for cities NGTL Pipeline Data Prior day deliveries etc Candace Spencer Terri Brian in Enron Canadas office pull this information from two different sources They pull this information together and fax updates us each morning NGTL Pipeline

requests to Frank Davis James Bruce AM To Donna CT cc Subject EnronOnline Newsticker Following our exchange of emails two weeks ago I spoke with Ross whom you suggested but he didnt know of you didnt think that anything he produced was sent to you He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond who wrote back saying that he didnt know anything either but that I should contact Rahil Jafry The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil and Im trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with him So could you tell me exactly where you get your information from for the following items Canadian Weather Forecasts day forecast for cities NGTL Pipeline Data Prior day deliveries etc US Natural Gas Stastics Gas in Storage Cumulative Heating Degree Days Even if you dont know the specific source if you could tell me how you get the information then Ill try to follow it up So for example Each day at am I receive a fax from with a list of numbers I take these numbers and put them in the Canadian Sorry to keep bothering you but this is a potentially serious issue for uswe need to know exactly where were getting our content from and no one seems to know So anything that you can do to help would be appreciated greatly Thanks in advance Jay From Donna Greif AM The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter distributed the ENA Commercial Team Ross Prevatt is the individual who actually puts the information together In talking with Ross this morning that information is taken from a Telerate feed the Telerate feeder gets the info from dailyweeklymonthly publications Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the information Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional information Thanks dg James Bruce AM Dear Donna Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday I was wondering if you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data the cumulative CDDHDD data are taken from inside Enron only Im asking because Paul Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that we carry on the website Many thanks Jay
