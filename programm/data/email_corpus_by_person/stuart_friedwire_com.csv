<11310471.1075841520898.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stuart@friedwire.com,2001-08-14 07:10:36,Checking inPST Holden My name is Stuart Wright and I am the Director of Marketing and Sales for F riedWire Inc I check our use log everyday and throughout the day and not ice that you are always among the most intensive users of our Traffic Repor t System I am very thankful for this and was wondering if you could tell me what you do at Enron and since you are such a great user if you have i deas for enhancing the Traffic Report We would value your feedback highly We are building two new tools that you should be aware of One is a greatl y expanded version of the Traffic Report that will contain the realtime pr icing and news from a major provider of this information We will be annou ncing more on this shortly and plan to deliver the new version in September Additionally FriedWire is building a PJM information module similar to the California tab now contained in the Traffic Report which presents regi onspecific information in the case of PJM mostly the LMP and FTR informa tion Following PJM we will be developing similar detailed regional module s for NYNE and ERCOT in order A very rough draft of the information co ntent in the PJM Module is outlined here in the attached PowerPoint file Some of the features you see may not be available in the very first release but wed love to hear your opinion on what features would be most useful We debated internally over whether or not our first independently releas ed PowerSurge product should cover PJM or some other region We chose PJM despite the fact that the PJM ISO already does a decent job of presentings haring market information and because PJM is such a liquid trading region a mong many of our existing clients Our goal however is to build a product that is so much more powerful than the PJM information interfaces such as eData that in selling the product we never get asked the question why sh ould I buy this when I can get eData for free That means a fair bit of w ork but its also the kind of work that were good at charting geographi c displays interface design email and wireless paging notification and integrating various data sources Some of the areas we think will be valua ble and set us apart from eData are Combining realtime and dayahead LMP data with the public FTR d ata to provide a realtime estimate of FTR value Easy interface for querying FTR data for the sake of competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets LMP charts and maps Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring Histogram displays of historical and realtime load and LMP data Mapping of planned and unplanned transmission constraints FriedWire would be especially interested in knowing Enrons interest in the FTR features In fact if you have a PJM expert that would be willing to talk to our lead product developer we would be grateful We know that PJM does very little with their display of the FTR information and we know tha t there is a lot of competitive intelligence to be gained from it but wer e not sure how many traders are interested in FTRs Our understanding is t hat theres not a lot of liquidity in the FTR markets and therefore there may not be lots of money to be madesaved there We also are going back an d forth about how to market and sell the PJM data Whether we integrate it straight into the Traffic Report or make it the first of a series of regio nal intelligence modules in a larger product called PowerSurge is current ly unknown Also the pricing for the product is not yet determined Take Care Stuart Wright
