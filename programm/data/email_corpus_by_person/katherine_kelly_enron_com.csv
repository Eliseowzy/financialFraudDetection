<5845965.1075853715780.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,katherine.kelly@enron.com,2000-01-26 10:41:00,Re Accounting stuff Let me know what you find out Thanks Cc to the CES acquisition we had between and little wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own These wells produce anywhere from dts to dts per day Most are very minimal probably dts or less This production is produced on several gathering lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas A couple of years ago Columbia Gas started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to Gatherco then they spun off part to CNR and the remainder are still held by Columbia Gas Around the th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and then we nominate the gas which takes up to several hours of updating time The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us credit for it in our pool Sounds simple The problem comes three months down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these little producers Prior to unify it didnt really effect us Client Services would just zero out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add each producer the wells that flowed the volume and make the final payment to each It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who was solely devoted to doing nothing but this Because unify was developed to put as much work up front in the process client services no longer has the back door to get the payment out the door This means that each well that we have on Columbia Gas must now have an individual ticket in sitara with a volume of currently our responsibility to set up and must have at least one path with a volume of for each month in unify Several months ago after converting to unify Robert Molly Lafuze Kathy Moore and Victor put in a massive effort over the course of about three weeks to get all of our own meters taken care of while still maintaining their respective jobs Generally its the same meters that flow and when we set them up we do it over a long period of time so the path just rolls from one month to next and as long as we keep up our tracking and balancing were just in maintenance mode However sometimes new wells come up at which point the process is to have the global group set up the meters and the counterparties set up a deal in sitara put a path in unify with a volume of create noms and track and balance Since we dont even get actuals to months after flow we usually have at least to months of catch up to do And of course as you are aware our systems have been running a little slow lately With the acquisition of CES we have taken on even more of the gas Ive heard on a couple of occasions just how many wells this is but Im sorry the number seems to have escaped me I know it is at least several hundred and that it is quit a bit more than we had previously This whole subject is one that has been passed around by several people including myself Chris Germany John Singer Jim Javins and Scott Neal on more than one occasion One thought that John Singer and Jim Javins had was to have someone named Hiedi in Jims office get access to our systems and input the gas herself Seems like a nice suggestion except that she is EES and I dont think that we want her in our sytems By the way John Singer and Jim Javins are the ones buying this wellhead gas They picked Hiedi because she works in the same office as Jim and they feel that she could give these little guys the hand holding treatment that they sometimes demand Yes its hard to believe but its the ones getting the checks that complain the most They thought that Hiedi could also be responsible for making the payments Anyway that suggestion wasnt really panning out so another suggestion has arisen as to setting up a whole new Enron entity that would handle the metered supply and we would be buying the gas from this entity First we would have to take into consideration whether it would restrict our flexibility on Columbia Gas Im not totally sure how to go about getting something like this off the ground but it does have merit Another thought was to hire someone here thats sole responsibility would be the metered supply They would hopefully become a specialist in the area and would work closely with Gloria in client services Jim Javins and John Singer The thought was to have them report either to me or to Scott Neal Chris and I tend to disagree in this area he thinks there is plenty of work for a full time person My opinion is that there is definitely a need for a special project over the course of some time but that once the initial push to get the meters in is done that it is more of a parttime responsibility The big problem with that though is right now the guys downstairs dont even have time to get these special type of requests done and it might be faster for Gloria to do them herself if she has proper training and access to our systems However regardless of which group gets the responsibility there is going to be a need for a very large effort within the next month or so when January actuals come in and we should be prepared Any way please give it some thought and let me know if you have any suggestions Id also like to here what your views might be Thanks Robert Superty PM To Katherine L CT cc Subject Re Accounting stuff Let me know what you find out Thanks Kathy who are we doing this for and why This isnt CES business is it Please get back to me thanks Bob From Katherine L Kelly PM To Robert CT cc Subject Re Accounting stuff Let me know what you find out Thanks Bob After talking with Robert about this request this morning I told him that I would look at future option but that in the meantime I would go ahead and take care of these for Gloria Well to my shock it took over three hours for me to complete the task of setting up deal in sitara and adding and pathing meters in unify over the course of six months Im not sure why I thought this but I thought it might take maybe minutes The whole process is really rather simple just very time consuming What scares me is that we are soon going to be having to do exactly this same thing for the hundreds of metered production wells that have come over with the CES acquisition At the current rate of business that we are doing I just dont see how will be able to accomplish this with our current resources We still have some time before we need to make a decision but a couple of possible solutions would be bring in some temporary help for a short period of time or give Gloria access to help out with this but then we give up part of the control of our systems to other group Forwarded by Katherine L KellyHOUECT on PM Victor Lamadrid PM To Robert CT cc Edward CT Katherine L CT Tricia CT Subject Re Accounting stuff Let me know what you find out Thanks EDKATHY Please help Theres gotta be a way that client services can add these producer meters and ZERO paths that are so old or learn how to do it Volumes are minimal and the TCO guys are swamped Im sure the SOUTHEAST schedulers get the same type of request from client services or they will with the CES wellhead stuff We dont have time to do the research for this stuff set up the meters and the tickets and the counterparties for little or no volume thats from JULY of HELLO That was a
