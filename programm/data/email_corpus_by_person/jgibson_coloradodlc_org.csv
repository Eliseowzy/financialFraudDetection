the national DLC His speech is at ndolcicfmkaidsubidcontentid Please let us know what you think Earlier this week Sen Joe Lieberman DCT made a thoughtful speech about the success of New Democrats in reviving their partys traditional commitment to a foreign policy that was valuesbased and fully engaged a defense policy that was muscular and modern and an economic policy that was internationalist Indeed Lieberman suggested that the Bush Administration has moved in a similar centrist direction in its impressively unifying response to the terrorist attacks of September eschewing its previous tendency towards unilateralism and a valuesneutral realism But Lieberman made news in his address to the fall conference of the New Democrat Network by openly saying what many Americans have privately concluded during the last month the logic of the Presidents wellarticulated position on the scope of the war on terrorism means that we cannot necessarily limit military action to Afghanistan In Liebermans words we must at some point become unyielding in our demands that countries like Syria and Iran end their support of terrorism before we will contemplate working with them Moreover said Lieberman it should make us unflinching in our determination to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq before he emboldened by September strikes at us with weapons of mass destruction Lieberman is one of the few elected officials from either party to publicly connect the dots between our proclaimed war on any form of terrorism with global reach and the obvious existence of a Middle Eastern rogue state that is sponsoring terrorism pursuing weapons of mass destruction continuing to threaten its neighbors and is dedicated to the elimination of the US presence in the region much of it necessitated of course by Iraqs continued behavior The President has eloquently and repeatedly said any country that is not on our side in the war on terrorism must be treated as a hostile power By any measure Iraq is a supremely hostile power that shares every antiAmerican impulse of both Al Qaeda and the Taliban while having far superior means for attacking us How can Iraq possibly be treated as irrelevant to this struggle How can we possibly demand that friendly regimes in the region decisively side with us while we ignore Iraq Unfortunately there have been several signals from the Administration that the US might shrink from the broader task of fighting terrorism even to the extent of leaving elements of the Taliban in power in Afghanistan if the more immediate task of capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and other top leaders of Al Qaeda can be accomplished The logic seems to be that removing the Taliban much less Saddam Hussein from power could create a dangerous power vacuum in those countries while destabilizing the international coalition against terrorism This line of argument is reminiscent of the reasoning behind the decision in to leave Hussein in power in Iraq followed by an unsuccessful sanctions regime and the permanent stationing of US troops in the Persian Gulf region Whatever you think about that decision and its consequences its clear now that we cannot let excessive concern for political stability and coalitionbuilding keep the United States from destroying the terrorist network and protecting our country from terrorist threats that continue every day Surely we learned on September that there are worse things in the world and worse things in the Middle East than power vacuums The Taliban after all was created in large part to bring order to Afghanistan which led to its active sponsorship of violent disorder elsewhere including our own country As for the antiterrorist coalition we should remember that coalitions are a means to an end not ends in themselves A coalition that cannot accept changes of regime in terrorist states whether in Kabul or Baghdad is not a terribly useful coalition to begin with As Lieberman put it if it becomes necessary as we hope it will not we could benefit from a dose of the Administrations previous preference for unilateralism As New Democrats have always argued multilateralism is the preferred means in a postCold War world for the vindication of Americans interests and values But especially in the case of an attack on the United States itself multilateralism should not become an excuse for inaction Does this mean we have to go to war in Iraq No but it does mean the matter must remain open so long as the terrorist network still threatens us Nonmilitary steps including a different regime of smart sanctions that hit Saddams thugs more than his already victimized citizenry are possible So too are military steps that could create truly autonomous Shiite and Kurdish regions in Iraq while leaving Saddam with a smaller domain But the point to remember is this we cannot treat the war on terrorism as a small skirmish in Afghanistan aimed solely at bin Laden and his closest associates As Joe Lieberman rightly said Our fundamental principles are at least as much on the line in this war against terrorism as they were in our battles with Nazism and Communism during the last century Lieberman performed a valuable service in reminding Democrats of the heritage of toughminded internationalism that characterized Democratic leaders like Truman and JFK during the postWorld War II era Its a heritage whose time has come once again

Democratic Leadership Council and New Democrat Movement in our state The Colorado DLC is a think tank focused on local state and federal issues of interest to this region The New Democrat Update is distributed to more than elected officials and private citizens the first week of each month REJUVENATING RURAL COLORADO In the old economy most rural areas had reasonably strong and stable economic bases to support growth and jobs In addition to low costs plentiful labor and adequate physical infrastructure rural regions depended on innovative economic activities filtering down from urban areas Clearly those days are over The innovative wellpaying industries increasingly cluster in the metropolitan suburbs providing minimal economic benefits to rural Colorado To date most rural economies have been largely left out and are having significant difficulty competing and prospering in the New Economy Rural communities face a new opportunity and challenge to prosper in this new world The opportunity unlike the old economy new technologies allow economic activity to be geographically farther apart while still functionally tight The challenge much of rural Colorado has limited access to highspeed telecommunications technologies a critical factor in determining business location and expansion decisions Federal state and local governments in partnership with the private sector must help rural communities adapt and develop innovative technologybased economies through seed venture programs technologyincubators industryuniversity research partnerships and collaborative technology modernization projects Ideally nonprofit entrepreneurial organizations linked to the private sector should run these initiatives Much like the digital economy todays economic strategies take a strong combination of good hardware and software The Colorado congressional delegation can help with the hardware by pushing for federal funding to coinvest in business applications with rural broadband telecommunications providers In addition they should support Senator Tom Daschles proposal to provide federal loans to rural utility providers for deployment of broadband telecommunication connections Growing and prospering in the New Economy also requires the right software in this case the skills and knowledge of young people As a result of an undue reliance on property taxes many rural school districts experience gross inequities The state can become a much better partner by overhauling its antiquated K public school funding system While money alone will not solve educational problems neither will a lack of resources Innovative privatepublic partnerships like PowerUP can also help With centers that have between and Internetconnected computers PowerUP provides practical training to young people by getting technology into schools community centers and other organizations The sites are open and welcoming as well as safe places for young people to spend time Staff encourage students to work together and computers are placed so that supervisors can see what is on each persons monitor at all times Among PowerUPs notable partners is the Corporation for National Services AmeriCorps program which provides young volunteers who in exchange for help with college tuition go into communities to set up and help manage the computer centers As nontechnical users and innovators these Digital Brigades help train local students while implementing technologybased projects that improve and help the community Colorado state and local governments should partner with the private sector and provide matching funds to spur development of rural technology centers The State of Florida has taken that approach leveraging a relatively modest investment and creating computer lab sites across the state Universities and community colleges can strengthen the competitiveness of rural firms by analyzing the specific needs of local economies and offering consulting services on technology and processes Public matching funds for joint universityprivate sector research can be tied to new product development Nonprofit corporations which share technological innovations and identify new product and process opportunities should be organized New technology clearinghouses can provide data on new patents and ideas relevant to local industries Forming innovative alliances as well as leveraging privatepublic sector funding leadership and volunteers can effectively meet rural Colorados economic challenges We have no time to waste CONNECTING TO RURAL COLORADO To develop a progressive majority coalition Colorado Democrats must do much in better in rural regions of the state Republicans control almost percent of county commissions and Democrats send a very small handful of rural legislators to the State House In the last presidential election Vice President Al Gore lost the rural vote by points State Democrats at all levels of government can close this gap by closely examining Mark Warners gubernatorial victory last month in Virginia His statewide message improvements in education and the quality of life would bring knowledge jobs to all parts of the state proved decisive Just as important Warner embraced mainstream valuesbased positions on cultural issues realizing that tone matters as well as substance Our party can speak about tough issues like gun control and gay rights without implying that no decent and reasonable person can have a different view Voters who feel marginalized even demonized by hardleft rhetoric will almost certainly retaliate For many rural voters the role of government is in part an issue of values The New Democratic stance on this issue that government should equip people to solve their own problems is sure to make significant inroads into the rural electorate NEW WORLD NEW WAR The NovemberDecember issue of Blueprint provides a roadmap on how America can defeat terrorism grow the economy and ask all Americans to give
