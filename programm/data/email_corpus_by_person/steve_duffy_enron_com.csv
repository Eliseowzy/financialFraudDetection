update Please let me know what happens SWD WALT ZIMMERMAN PM To Steve ott cc Dana ott Lori ott Susan ott Michael ott Stanley nron Subject Todoroff ProsecutionCONFIDENTIALSUBJECT TO ATTORNEYCLIENT PRIVILEGE Steve as Dana indicated in his response to your message Louis Dreyfus is maintaining that their transactions with Todoroff are totally legitimate and binding upon EOTT Vinson Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract we need to hear the tapes of Todoroffs conversations with Louis Dreyfus The paper that we have including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract administrator certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that something was not quite right about the December transaction with Todoroff but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the validityenforceability of that contract We need more John DeGeeter of Vinson Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus general counsel Louis Dreyfus general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing EOTT with the tapes he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is requesting the tapes Louis Dreyfus general counsel has also indicated that he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations Although a final decision has not been made heres where I think we are headed with Louis Dreyfus We will send their general counsel a letter next week indicating the irregularities with this contract eg the prices quoted in the contract were far below market and the contract administrator had questions about Todoroffs authorization and the legality of the deal This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT My guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus lawyers to listen to the tapes If the tapes do contain incriminating conversations we might see a softening of their negotiating position If the tapes do not contain anything incriminating it would seem to be in Louis Dreyfus best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position that there was nothing irregular about the transaction Steve Duffy PM To Walt ott cc Dana ott Lori ott Susan ott Michael ott Stanley nron Subject Re Todoroff ProsecutionCONFIDENTIALSUBJECT TO ATTORNEYCLIENT PRIVILEGE Thanks for the update Walt One option we were considering was a share the pain settlement with Dreyfus whereby they would let us buy out of the remaining position at a steep discount to acknowledge their contributory negligence in this matter Has there been any additional headway in this area Im on vacation and havent heard anything on this Werent we going to send a VE litigator to visit Dreyfus general counsel If we commence legal proceedings against Dreyfus things will become costly and contentious between us Information will come slowly and grudgingly We have copies of some of their internal notes which indicate that they knewor should have knownthat something wasnt quite right with Todoroffs situation Before we start filing discovery motions we should exhaust the possibility of meeting with their general counsel to see if a quick business settlement can be obtained Please advise Thanks SWD WALT ZIMMERMAN AM To Dana ott Lori ott Susan ott cc Michael ott Steve ott Stanley nron Subject Todoroff ProsecutionCONFIDENTIALSUBJECT TO ATTORNEYCLIENT PRIVILEGE Earlier this week I spoke with Bill Moore the chief prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorneys Special Crimes Unit regarding the abovereferenced matter Mr Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative materials that we submitted last week and he indicated that his office is commencing its review of those materials I emphasized to Mr Moore the desire of EOTTs management to have this case aggressively prosecuted Mr Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts and he assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter Based upon some statements made by Mr Moore during our discussion it was obvious that he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting I will call Mr Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this matter We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of Todoroffs conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are describing as The Second Transaction If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes or if they assert that tapes do not exist the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes Based upon some notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus it appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss with The Second Transaction Assuming that Todoroffs conversations with Louis Dreyfus were taped the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its conversations with Todoroff we will need some guidance from Enron as to how aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes

comment on same once she returns from vacation SWD Baird Bob PM To Horton Stan cc Steve ott Pena Carlos Subject Available Cash for the Fourth Quarter CONFIDENTIALATTORNEYCLIENT PRIVILEGE Stan I have given considerable thought to the issue you raised in the meeting on June that is whether the amount of Available Cash for the fourth quarter of could be recomputed so that the issuance of APIs for that quarter could be rescinded My delay in getting back to you was occasioned by the fact that I went on vacation shortly after that meeting and just returned to work yesterday The reason the question is worth exploring is this Enron Corp has certain rights under its support agreement with EOTT and it is entitled to exercise those rights notwithstanding the fact that it also has a fiduciary duty as a controlling shareholder I approached the question solely as counsel for Enron and from the standpoint of evaluating the merits of any claim that Enron could make that the API issuance should be rescinded From that standpoint it is no different from asking if EOTT were dealing with an unrelated third party would that third party have a claim for rescission Unfortunately based on the facts as I understand them I have been unable to formulate a claim that has sufficient merit to be worthy of assertion as explained below The computation of Available Cash for any quarter is based on a cash receipts and disbursements and b increases or reductions in cash reserves which the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate Thus the question is whether there is a basis for recomputing the cash receipts or the reserves for the fourth quarter Cash Receipts I would think there may well be a valid claim in a situation in which EOTT made a mistake in its calculations of cash receipts or disbursements even if that mistake was discovered several months later It is my understanding however that the scrubdown of the books for the fourth quarter turned up only immaterial discrepancies from the amounts that had been calculated for the fourth quarter in midFebruary when the distribution of Available Cash for the quarter was made Thus I am aware of no meritorious argument that Enron is entitled to rescission because of EOTTs mistakes in calculating its cash receipts or disbursements for the quarter That being the case the only other issue that is worth focusing on is the reserves Reserves The only component of the reserves that I am aware of that is large enough to bear scrutiny is the theftrelated insurance item There were no cash receipts from the insurance prior to the distribution so any claim for rescission must focus on the amount of reserves for the fourth quarter If the level of reserves was determined in a manner that was not consistent with the reasonable discretion standard set forth in the partnership agreement Enron would have a valid claim for rescission Presumably had the General Partner known in midFebruary that insurance would cover the million loss other than the deductible it would have reduced reserves by million either by setting aside less in reserves or releasing reserves established in prior quarters which would have produced million of additional Available Cash In that case there would not have been any APIs required Is there a basis for a claim that the General Partner did not use reasonable discretion when it established the level of reserves Based on the facts as I understand them I have been unable to come up with a good argument that the General Partner was not using its reasonable discretion in making the determination it made It is my understanding that although at the time the General Partner was aware that it had theft insurance it did not know whether the insurance would cover the entire million loss or merely the in fair market value of the product at the time of the theft less the deductible I also understand that the insurance carrier had not admitted liability at that time so there was some question whether there would be any insurance proceeds Thus it seems it would be very difficult to establish that the General Partner did not use its reasonable discretion The partnership agreement makes it clear that the amount of Available Cash is to be computed based on a actual receipts and disbursements during the quarter and b distributions from the operating partnerships and reserves established or changes in reserves that in each case occur prior to the date on which the Partnership makes its distribution of Available Cash in respect of such quarter Thus the partnership agreement leaves no room for going back and redoing reserves based on events that occur after the distribution for the quarter Please call if you have any

the opinion that before we assert an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract we need to hear the tapes of Todoroffs conversations with Louis Dreyfus The paper that we have including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract administrator certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that something was not quite right about the December transaction with Todoroff but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the validityenforceability of that contract We need more John DeGeeter of Vinson Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus general counsel Louis Dreyfus general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing EOTT with the tapes he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is requesting the tapes Louis Dreyfus general counsel has also indicated that he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations Although a final decision has not been made heres where I think we are headed with Louis Dreyfus We will send their general counsel a letter next week indicating the irregularities with this contract eg the prices quoted in the contract were far below market and the contract administrator had questions about Todoroffs authorization and the legality of the deal This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT My guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus lawyers to listen to the tapes If the tapes do contain incriminating conversations we might see a softening of their negotiating position If the tapes do not
