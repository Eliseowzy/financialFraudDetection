Geoff vanUlden Dirk OJones Deborah SmootRobert Rank Stephan BosleyAnnamaria MessinaJeff Subject RE UCCSU PGE meter data Diann This issue has been around awhile It is an important one to resolve You broke the logjam Thanks I propose the following tasks to get started Validate the list of meters below to insure that it is complete Action OMD Identify the full life cycle cost impact per campus and account Action OMD Send letters to each campus to offer the meter change identify the value and benefits of the change clarify schedule and cost impacts and request confirmation of their willingness to change out the meters Action Draft by OMD review and distribution by AM Investigate the installation of transdata meters with or without phone lines to replace the Santa Cruz cogen meters Action CSC Also I would like to investigate the possibility of extending the EnergySense no cost option beyond Its value is just beginning to be utilized because of the many missteps in the beginning I would

To Wright James Cc Pollard Geoff vanUlden Dirk OJones Deborah SmootRobert BosleyAnnamaria Subject Re UCCSU PGE meter data Jim I suppose the first thing we need to do is make sure the campuses are amenable to this As I recall the reason we used existing IDR meters was to mitigate the cost to the campuses The only instance where we were not able to change PGEs meters was at Santa Cruz cogen but

Robert J Smoot AM Phone No To ENRON ENRON cc Robert ES Clifford R ES Diann ES Mark ES Narayan ES Subject UCCSU PGE meter data Art and Pat We are really under the gun to deliver on this issue involving the PGE meters located throughout the UCCSU campuses We EEIS have tried to assure those interested parties repeatedly that we will deliver on this ability to display PGE data via EnergySense and have not came close to satisfying this commitment This has been an ongoing ulcer so to speak since I came into the loop late last March I have been told many reasons why we cant display the data and some possible solutions to make this evolution happen But up to now no solid answers or solutions have been provided As you may know we are providing this service at no charge to the UCCSU campuses until At that time EEIS would like to present this service to the campuses in a revenue generating contract But unless we get this last sticking point involving the PGE meters resolved there are some vocal critics within the UCCSU structure that will most likely be opposed to the continued usage of the EnergySense product especially when it would be on a payfor basis from and beyond They the campuses view this problem as a simple fix In fact one campuss most important meters to view are PGE meters which currently cant be displayed This particular location has four nonaccessible meters via EnergySense and are a result of this PGE problem This is becoming a serious customer satisfaction issue that needs to be moved up on the priority list and deserves a positive resolution We can display some of the interval data involving PGE meters but not for all of the meters I have previously forwarded a list of the problem meters to Pat Priestley for action She did respond that she was working on a resolution but we now must get a quicker remedy in place Your cooperation and assistance involving this matter will be appreciated Should you have any questions please contact me I will be looking forward to receiving a response on how to solve this issue in a timely manner I would like to communicate the resolution to the involved parties by the first of next week Thanks Robert

customerowned meter for calculating the cogen payments ie SJSU we need to defer the Santa Cruz meter installation I will need to get a read from PGE before we waste any of the UCSCs money I have asked Jeff Dasovich to include this issue in his Rule and arguments before the CPUC More fireworks to follow Dirk Original Message From Wright James Sent Thursday October PM To HuddlesonDiann Cc Pollard Geoff vanUlden Dirk OJones Deborah SmootRobert Rank Stephan BosleyAnnamaria MessinaJeff Subject RE UCCSU PGE meter data Diann This issue has been around awhile It is an important one to resolve You broke the logjam Thanks I propose the following tasks to get started Validate the list of meters below to insure that it is complete Action OMD Identify the full life cycle cost impact per campus and account Action OMD Send letters to each campus to offer the meter change identify the value and benefits of the change clarify schedule and cost impacts and request confirmation of their willingness to change out the meters Action Draft by OMD review and distribution by AM Investigate the installation of transdata meters with or without phone lines to replace the Santa Cruz cogen meters Action CSC Also I would like to investigate the possibility of extending the EnergySense no cost option beyond Its value is just beginning to be utilized because of the many missteps in the beginning I would recommend a year extension If approved this should be included in the letter to the customer Lets talk while I am in Houston next week Jim Original Message From HuddlesonDiann Sent Thursday October AM To Wright James Cc Pollard Geoff vanUlden Dirk OJones Deborah SmootRobert BosleyAnnamaria Subject Re UCCSU PGE meter data Jim I suppose the first thing we need to do is make sure the campuses are amenable to this As I recall the reason we used existing IDR meters was to mitigate the cost to the campuses The only instance where we were not able to change PGEs meters was at Santa Cruz cogen but we may be able to come up with a different solution with Steve Krein and Ben Garcias input How should we proceed Forwarded by Diann HuddlesonHOUEES on AM OLE Object Picture Device Independent Bitmap

Diann Your point is well taken We need to get the ball rolling and investigate the possibility of replacing these IDR meters with Enron meters The following list of meters are the ones that pose the

Robert J Smoot AM Phone No To ENRON ENRON cc Robert ES Clifford R ES Diann ES Mark ES Narayan ES Subject UCCSU PGE meter data Art and Pat We are really under the gun to deliver on this issue involving the PGE meters located throughout the UCCSU campuses We EEIS have tried to assure those interested parties repeatedly that we will deliver on this ability to display PGE data via EnergySense and have not came close to satisfying this commitment This has been an ongoing ulcer so to speak since I came into the loop late last March I have been told many reasons why we cant display the data and some possible solutions to make this evolution happen But up to now no solid answers or solutions have been provided As you may know we are providing this service at no charge to the UCCSU campuses until At that time EEIS would like to present this service to the campuses in a revenue generating contract But unless we get this last sticking point involving the PGE meters resolved there are some vocal critics within the UCCSU structure that will most likely be opposed to the continued usage of the EnergySense product especially when it would be on a payfor basis from and beyond They the campuses view this problem as a simple fix In fact one campuss most important meters to view are PGE meters which currently cant be displayed This particular location has four nonaccessible meters via EnergySense and are a result of this PGE problem This is becoming a serious customer satisfaction issue that needs to be moved up on the priority list and deserves a positive resolution We can display some of the interval data involving PGE meters but not for all of the meters I have previously forwarded a list of the problem meters to Pat Priestley for action She did respond that she was working on a resolution but we now must get a quicker remedy in place Your cooperation and assistance involving this matter will be appreciated Should you have any questions please contact me I will be looking forward to receiving a response on how to solve this issue in a timely manner I would like to communicate the resolution to the involved parties by the first of next week Thanks Robert
