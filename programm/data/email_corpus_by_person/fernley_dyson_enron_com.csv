scenario portrayed here but stranger things have happened will keep you posted Forwarded by Fernley DysonLONECT on James New To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR However as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator I have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying Sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know James

via the PRC process but we all know that this is a partial solution its about changing the culture Europe isnt any better or worse in this respect and this is a more intransigent problem that we need to work at every single day I have to say that the Helsinki scare was really helpful in this respect I think you would notice a difference Ill ask James and Mike to follow up on your specific points Regards Fernley From David Port ENRON To Fernley CT cc Steve W CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Re UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit Sorry to hear about this one I have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account It looks like the old undue influence problem again It seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we dont have any way to protect them if they do there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career And that is because twice a year at the PRC that can happen This incident shows some of these attributes For the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of the operations staff Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers Brokerage is in the PL and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerage Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable it should be done same day I would not have waited for the traders to do it but I would want to know why it took them so long Given that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices I would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time Essentially if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did I would pursue explanations to points and DP Fernley CT AM To James CT cc Richard CT Mike CT Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Steve

New To Richard CT Fernley CT Mike CT cc Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Subject UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit On the th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that twolate trades had been entered into the gas traders Blue book which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative PL impact negative om The late deals were done on the rd of February Marcello Romano and the th of March Haakon Olafson and were both forward starting sells for periods in Background Input errors For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most significant number coming form the UK Gas traders Numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the blue book the Gas traders are currently the only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation system there is currently a big push to change this which has the support of John Sherriff with a deadline date of July In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen A log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May which highlights an error rate of of non EOL trades This has been discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected Deal booking and reconciliation process Non EOL trades Deals are initially written into the blue book by the gas traders when the deal is done This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day Faxed broker statements are received usually by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary At this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade relevant later New Deal sign off As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination PL For the rd of February Marcello signed off the new deals sheet and for the th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off Documentation convention In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation relevant later Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after trade booking Brokerage invoices Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to authorise for payment Any deals which cannot be found are raised with documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders Specific details of these late trades Summary For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving or can it be established that we did not receive a broker statement which is a primary control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements in April and was completed by the th with the invoices falling due for payment on the th The work practice at that time was that brokerage invoices including those with non reconciling trade queries were batched together and passed to the traders This would have taken place on the th of April Details on exactly what was said and done in the weeks between passing these invoices to the traders for approval although there are claims that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions and when a mailed follow up was made on the nd of May are hazy What is clear is that on the nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals being booked on the th of June Deal specifics EES Broker Morgan Stanley trade on Feb Trader Marcello EES Invoice date March Invoice received before March as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott settlements

Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was requested Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes Who was at fault and where did the control break down I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas traders accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades Despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen It has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this The current error rate is of non EOL trades Documentation currently estimate that in times out of the broker or counterparty are correct Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived Most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade Reconciliations of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously and by mail errors and omissions on a more timely basis There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders This is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment Action Points Trading Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis Trade Support Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from July to September the traded part of the curve

scenario portrayed here but stranger things have happened will keep you posted Forwarded by Fernley DysonLONECT on James New To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR However as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator I have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying Sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know James

the PRC process but we all know that this is a partial solution its about changing the culture Europe isnt any better or worse in this respect and this is a more intransigent problem that we need to work at every single day I have to say that the Helsinki scare was really helpful in this respect I think you would notice a difference Ill ask James and Mike to follow up on your specific points Regards Fernley From David Port ENRON To Fernley CT cc Steve W CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Re UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit Sorry to hear about this one I have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account It looks like the old undue influence problem again It seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we dont have any way to protect them if they do there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career And that is because twice a year at the PRC that can happen This incident shows some of these attributes For the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of the operations staff Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers Brokerage is in the PL and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerage Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable it should be done same day I would not have waited for the traders to do it but I would want to know why it took them so long Given that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices I would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time Essentially if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did I would pursue explanations to points and DP Fernley CT AM To James CT cc Richard CT Mike CT Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Steve

New To Richard CT Fernley CT Mike CT cc Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Subject UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit On the th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that twolate trades had been entered into the gas traders Blue book which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative PL impact negative om The late deals were done on the rd of February Marcello Romano and the th of March Haakon Olafson and were both forward starting sells for periods in Background Input errors For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most significant number coming form the UK Gas traders Numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the blue book the Gas traders are currently the only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation system there is currently a big push to change this which has the support of John Sherriff with a deadline date of July In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen A log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May which highlights an error rate of of non EOL trades This has been discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected Deal booking and reconciliation process Non EOL trades Deals are initially written into the blue book by the gas traders when the deal is done This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day Faxed broker statements are received usually by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary At this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade relevant later New Deal sign off As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination PL For the rd of February Marcello signed off the new deals sheet and for the th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off Documentation convention In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation relevant later Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after trade booking Brokerage invoices Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to authorise for payment Any deals which cannot be found are raised with documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders Specific details of these late trades Summary For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving or can it be established that we did not receive a broker statement which is a primary control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements in April and was completed by the th with the invoices falling due for payment on the th The work practice at that time was that brokerage invoices including those with non reconciling trade queries were batched together and passed to the traders This would have taken place on the th of April Details on exactly what was said and done in the weeks between passing these invoices to the traders for approval although there are claims that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions and when a mailed follow up was made on the nd of May are hazy What is clear is that on the nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals being booked on the th of June Deal specifics EES Broker Morgan Stanley trade on Feb Trader Marcello EES Invoice date March Invoice received before March as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott settlements started on March Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Emma Thomson Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was sent on May as requested by documentation to prove deal Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes IEB Broker NP trade on Mar Trader Haakon IEB invoice date April Invoice received before April as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was requested Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes Who was at fault and where did the control break down I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas traders accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades Despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen It has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this The current error rate is of non EOL trades Documentation currently estimate that in times out of the broker or counterparty are correct Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived Most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade Reconciliations of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously and by mail errors and omissions on a more timely basis There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders This is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment Action Points Trading Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis Trade Support Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from July to September the traded part of the curve

scenario portrayed here but stranger things have happened will keep you posted Forwarded by Fernley DysonLONECT on James New To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR However as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator I have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying Sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know James

James Jordan Mike Apollo Beth Brown Michael COO London Subject RE UK Continental Power Doorstep In an October update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues In reviewing the plans for th quarter one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September th terrorists attacks We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned th quarter reviews until early Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the th quarter Certainly life on October feels different today at Enron than it did on October I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process and in your case the voluntary redundancy program In the next few days I will again review the th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey sharing with them your concerns I will let you know the outcome of those conversations If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year we will work
