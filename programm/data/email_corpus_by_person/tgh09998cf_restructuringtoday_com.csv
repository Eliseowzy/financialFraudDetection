nationally Joe Barton thinks it can and is about to try Once in years opportunity seen How can the retail power market be opened in todays atmosphere Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual meeting in Washington Barton implored the membership that if they have any ideas on how to improve energy policy this is the time to tell policy makers or him Barton sees a narrow sixweek opportunity as America is about to revise its energy policy We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he means by a major energy restructuring bill He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of power from one place to another He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it in an open access way creating all these trading markets where you have longterm and shortterm markets where you balance supply and demand around the country States that have surplus power through the RTO system can wheel that power to states that need it Thats the wholesale market we asked Yes But what about retail He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of buyers How would that work AARP Barton said noticing our age could sell you power or Wal Mart or McDonalds or the coops You could buy your power through them How would a law provide for aggregation It would be in the federal legislation that it would be permitted he replied But what about Nebraska where there are only munis Youve got to work through that and see if you get some kind of grandfather or state optout provision Its possible that you give states the right to opt out But over time those states will want to opt in he added Thatll be a debate well have when we get into the bill Youre not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process he reminded with a smile Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation gestating in the nations capital Everything is up for discussion he said everything There is nothing nothing thats been debated or talked about in terms of electricity that is not on the table Barton assured Im not saying were going to do it all but you have a window like this once every to years Im going to be damned if Im going to stand around and on my on volition take things off the table Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial items out of play Therell be a region or a political block who knows the president might not like something John Dingell might not like something Who knows But Im not even before we put pen to paper to start drafting the bill say were not going to consider this Barton added Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative Yeah Very cooperative Of course again the proof is in the pudding and in the details Bartons in the leadership role in fostering a national energy policy taking the package from the vice president and guiding it through the House Hes the presidents energy guy from an energy state and Bush has shown with the tax bill that he can get a program enacted Barton wants something he can look back at in five and years and say thats a good bill It works Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be national longterm in its impact and balanced Balanced means looking at the generation component transmission and distribution and in each of those areas this is just me Im not speaking for anyone but myself he wants to create an environment so we have a maximum competitive situation thats open and fair to everybody And were going to do that and youre going to have a lot of competition a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and a lot of choice for yourself Barton added Wait a minute Hes saying competition in transmission and distribution We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the time is right We cant help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity in a secondary market You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local distribution system in gas Were thinking aloud here Thats not what Barton said He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually have to That puts Barton a little at variance with some in the Bush Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age theres a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the political arena means let Washington do it Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into the bill a distributed generation component Hes interested in negawatts fostering cut backs in demand on a national scale Looking out for your own interest Barton considers to be democracy But from time to time you have to step back and look at the national interest he advocated Thats my job Todays crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House encouraged by the presidents pride about the retail bill he got through the Texas Legislature plus todays environment may be ideal for market minded leaders You can benefit from Restructuring Todays special unique focus on the converging energy and communications industries especially the opening of competitive markets too To subscribe simply fax the attached
