with banks for a new credit line of between billion and billion a nd is likely to close a deal within days according to officials familiar w ith the matter The new credit line is intended to bolster Enrons financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence The new credit would supplement existing lines which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about billion to increase cash reser ves and calm fears in the stock bond and energy markets An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l ine but said he couldnt supply any further details Houstonbased Enron is the nations biggest energy trader and a principal i n nearly onequarter of all electricity and naturalgas trades Once a favo rite of Wall Street the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi ncing a deeply concerned investment community that despite difficulties i ts finances remain sound Confidence in Enrons financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th is month announced a million thirdquarter loss and disclosed a b illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its thenchief financial officer An drew Fastow Last week Enron replaced Mr Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha nge Commission was looking into the transactions The company has consisten tly said that the transactions were proper and legal Enrons stock price fell again Friday As of pm in composite trading o n the New York Stock Exchange Enron shares were down cents at E nron shares have fallen in the past two weeks and are down from a S ept high of Late last week Enron tapped its existing credit lines with part of that m oney being used to redeem nearly billion of its outstanding commercial p aper or shortterm corporate IOUs Ron Barone of creditrating agency Stan dard Poors said he believes that Enron was getting a bit more resistanc e recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due Thus Enro n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin g he said The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly billion cash on ha nd would give it more financial flexibility Also last week creditrating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enrons debt and commercialpaper ratings for a possible downgrade A lowe r rating could hamper Enrons core trading businesses Behind the worries among these agencies in part is the loss of investor c onfidence which one of the rating companies Fitch said in a report last week could impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital mark ets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the companys trading partners are doing business with Enron on essentially the same terms as they have in t he past There has been no significant change in the credit conditions h e said Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giants f inances The banks involved in the current negotiations including JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n ew credit line than they had asked for in the past one official said Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments Confid ence in this company was lost said one bank official involved in the nego tiations for a new credit line But confidence will be restored Corporations of Enrons size commonly establish credit lines only to demons trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency they have a ccess to cash In practice few companies actually make use of these lines Thus drawing down credit lines while providing immediate cash also illu strates the pressure Enron is feeling Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Managers Journal How Enron Ran Out of Gas By Paul Kedrosky The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Is troubled Enron Corp the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark ets or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man y of their own press releases Or is poor Enron just misunderstood Those a re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele ases from the beleaguered Houstonbased energy concern A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot While tech stocks were tanking Enrons shares gained during Even diehard Enron skeptics of which there are many had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company Earnings were up and revenues more than doubled Not bad considering where the company came from A decade ago of Enron s revenues came from the staid and regulated gaspipeline business No l onger Enron has been selling those assets steadily partly fuelling revenu es but also expanding into new areas By around of its revenues and more than of its profits came from trading energy and buying and s elling stakes in energy producers The stock market applauded the move At its peak Enron was trading at arou nd times earnings Thats more like Ciscos once tropospheric valuation than the meager times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy But Enron management wanted more It was after all a new economy Webba sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded Ac cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay the company deserved to be value d accordingly At a conference early this year he told investors the compan ys stock should be trading much higher say more than double its p rice then Then the new economy motor stalled The companys president left under stra nge circumstances And rumors swirled about Enrons machinations in Califor nias energy markets Investors pored over Enrons weakening financial stat ements But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the companys cryptic financials In effect Enrons troubles were hiding in plain sight It should have been a warning Because of the poor financial disclosure the re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company or how it was trying to make its numbers Most analysts blithely concede that they really didnt know how Enron made money in good markets or bad Not that Enron didnt make money it did albeit with a worrisomely low r eturn on equity given the capital required but sometimes revenues came f rom asset sales and complex offbalance sheet transactions sometimes from energytrading revenues And it was very difficult to understand why or how or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter Enrons financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff Deep inside the compan y filings was mention of LJM Cayman LP a private investment partnership According to Enrons March K a senior officer of Enron is the m anaging member of LJM Well that was a puzzler LJM was helping Enron ma nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset s by entering into derivatives including swaps puts and collars It was in a phrase Enrons house hedge fund There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market it is crucial for a marketmaker But having an Enron executive managin g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether especially when the Enron executive was the companys CFO Andrew Fastow While he sev ered his connection with LJM and related partnerships in July of this yea r and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week the damage had bee n done As stories in this paper have since made clear Mr Fastows LJM partnershi p allegedly made millions from the conflictridden boardapproved LJMEnro n relationship And recently Enron ended the merry affair taking a billion dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJMs wrongfoo ted hedging Analysts investors and the Securities Exchange Commission were left with many questions and very few answers To be fair I suppose Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y ear ago saying it had erected a Chinese wall between FastowLJM and the co mpany And in a bull market no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was or questioned the strength of the wall Now it matters as do other Enronhedged financings a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in We didnt do anything wrong is Mr Lays refrain in the companys current r ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls That remains to be se en but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment and hero ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans parency Where has Enrons board of directors been through all of this What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics government sorts and r etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders Very little it seems It is time Enrons board did a proper investigation and then cleaned house perhaps neatly finishing with themselves Mr Kedrosky is a professor of business at the University of British Colomb ia Copyright Dow Jones

ommercial paper Now by obtaining even more financing Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energytrading firms that it will not face a c ash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it Enrons board which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last t wo weeks to monitor the companys financial situation held another meeting this afternoon The board is meeting frequently and will announce any ac tions when appropriate an Enron spokesman said Two weeks ago Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving it s former chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow who was ousted last wee k The company also disclosed about billion in separate writeoffs and it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an i nquiry into its financial accounting Enron hopes to maintain its investmentgrade credit rating which is crucia l to ensuring

Enron flickers Once a paragon of the new economy th e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and freewhee ling management write Simon London and Sheila McNulty Enron has some explaining to do For the past decade or more the Texasbas ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast growing energy trader Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year The US S ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multimillion dollar dea ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic er which resulted in a bn reduction in shareholders equity A hastily convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these relatedparty transactions The departure of A ndy Fastow the aforementioned CFO soon followed With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity This marks the end of Enrons walk on the wild side observes Curt Launer an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston the investment bank On the surface events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete riorating trading conditions a complex capital structure and poor investor relations But the root causes go back further The entrepreneurial cultur e and dynamic management that fuelled Enrons growth in the s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle new economy magic o n to old economy companies Enrons transformation began in earnest in with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling who was hired from McKinsey the management consulting firm to develop energy trading For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay a former deputy un dersecretary of energy Mr Lay remains chairman But it was Mr Skilling wh o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply ing it The two sides of the business trading and generationsupply have always been strange bedfellows The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility Mr Skillings answer in the early s was to bring in talent from outside the company One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow an expert in securitisation the repackag ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself A management structure was introduced with only four layers vicepresident director manager and associate analyst much like a consulting firm E mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked so long as they d elivered results As one of Mr Skillings early recruits recalled It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules The seemingly freewheeling style was based on a loosetight management m odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman the management writers and M cKinsey alumni At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets Upandcoming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory Louise Kitchen the yearold British executive who was the creative forc e behind Enron Online the groups internetbased trading platform changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri sk legal commitments finance and performance evaluationremuneration Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way As long as you clear you r deals or business ideas through those screens you can do whatever you wa nt around here This approach did deliver growth and innovation As well as making markets in its core energy products Enron now trades everything from weather deriv atives which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c limatic conditions to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals T he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world s leading ecommerce company It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v enture with International Business Machines and America Online the interne t service provider In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazines list of the most power ful US corporations ahead of such corporate giants as IBM ATT Bank of America and Boeing In retrospect however this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac hieved at a price First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job Personal nonheal th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan ation A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded Enron used a range of offbalance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion LJM the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enrons accounts Other financing vehicles include Osprey Marlin Whitewing Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix They went after too many things too quickly says Stephen Moo re of Moodys Investors Service the credit ratings agency A third cost associated with the last was a loss of financial transparenc y The groups extensive use of swaps options and other derivative financi al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money or the underlying risks t o which it is exposed David Fleischer an analyst at Goldman Sachs summed up the views of many i nvestors during last weeks conference call He told the groups management The companys credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne ed for much more disclosure There is an appearance that you are hiding som ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus The problems in our view stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski lls argues Raymond Niles analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Power plants in India water companies extension of their franchise to the mass retail market and using a fibreoptic network to deliver content over the interne t are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core merchant e nergy business Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s ome of these ventures This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr on Broadband was a business worth bn bn in its own right This hel ped push the share price to alltime highs and storing up trouble when tr ading volumes failed to materialise They overpromised on the new business they created says Chris Bartlett a professor at Harvard Business School and longtime watcher of the compan y Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br oadband business To some extent they are now paying the price Will Enron weather the storm Notwithstanding the risk of further outofth eblue financial shocks most analysts believe that it will The merchant e nergy business remains powerful and profitable Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B arney points out that this side of the group drives more than per cent o f earnings and has shown consistent per cent annual growth over the p ast three years Assets totalling more than bn were also earmarked for di sposal before the current crisis erupted underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the groups portfolio of physical energy assets And yet the doubts remain It is ultimately a question of confidence and credibility Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man agement methods has tilted too far towards the former Mr Lay and his team will have to tighten up c Copyright Financial Times

cent since the October a nnouncement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically junk status though its official ratings are still investment grade Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their abil ity to operate their trading and marketing operations said Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney These activities require at least an investment g rade

Constellations chairman RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES Bakke said one prong of AESs brave new world scenario was a renewed empha sis on the traditionally profitable longterm contract generation business

period of flat growth according to Gordon Howald energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise Calpine does it already he said referring to the Californiabased indep endent power producer that has the lions

southwest of Tokyo the report said Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell electricity directly to large commercial users without going through exiting utilities the report said Money and BusinessFinancial Desk Section OnceMighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A OPPEL Jr The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company IS time running out for Enron At the beginning of this year the Enron Corporation the worlds dominant energy trader appeared unstoppable The companys decadelong effort to pe rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif ornia to New York Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie ws would be heard in Washington Its sales profits and stock were soaring And under the leadership of Jeffrey K Skilling its chief executive Enron s arrogance had grown even more quickly The company based in Houston dripped contempt for the regulators and cons umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets for elec tricity water and everything else Everyone would win under deregulation Enron said especially its shareholders whose stock would soar as the co mpany profited from creating new markets We are on the side of angels Mr Skilling said in March dismissing th ose who saw the company as a profiteer in Californias energy crisis Peo ple want to have open competitive markets They want fair competition It s the American way But less than a year later everybody seems to have lost especially Enron s investors Enrons stock is plunging and questions about its finances ar e mounting Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt ed and energy prices could grow more volatile In a worstcase outlook Enr on could become the version of LongTerm Capital Management the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of Enrons shares have fallen more than percent this year erasing bil lion in shareholder value Enron closed on Friday at down cents after hitting a week lo w of earlier in the day The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year a crisis that ende d only when that state contradicted deregulations basic tenets by interven ing deeply in the power market Enrons efforts to become a profitmaking w ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci ty have been expensive failures In August Mr Skilling quit forcing Kenn eth L Lay his predecessor as chief executive and still Enrons chairman to resume daytoday control of the company The company declined to make senior executives including Mr Lay availabl e for comment and asked that questions be submitted in writing Mr Skilli ng could not be reached Enrons problems boiled over earlier this month when it disclosed that its shareholders equity a measure of the companys value dropped by bi llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E nrons regular financial statements The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the companys financial reporting and some investors ques tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin g electricity and natural gas THE slump in the companys shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders equity On Wednesday the company forced out its chie f financial officer Andrew S Fastow who is at the center of the controve rsy over Enrons confusing finances The company which six months ago seem ed to be reaping billions of dollars from Californias energy crisis today faces a potential cash crunch The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors smoldering concer n about Enrons opaque financial statements Now with Wall Street analysts and bondrating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran sactions that have fueled the companys profits Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas h Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash On Thursday the company drew down a billion credit line it had previousl y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J P Morgan Chase w hich have each extended at least million But because of Enrons impor tance in the natural gas and electricity markets industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev en if the company failed because Enron is mainly a trader rather than a p roducer of energy But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili ty of energy prices which have swung wildly in the last year Philip K Verleger Jr an energymarkets economist emphasized that he tho ught Enron would survive this crisis But he said it was not clear what wou ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the companys Enr onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there are the y good Are the firms hedges good Whats the situation Mr Verleger sa id Its got everyone scared In the short run Enrons credit rating may be its biggest problem If the companys rating falls below investment grade Enron could be forced to iss ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee d But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va luable because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th e company A drop in the companys credit rating could also prompt other energy trader s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron hurting the co mpanys sales and profits Enrons credit rating stands several notches above the critical point But its bonds which are publicly traded have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost percent comparable with many junk bon ds Two of the three major creditrating agencies Moodys Investors Servic e and Fitch Investors Service have put Enrons bonds on review for possibl e downgrades The issue thats in the front of everybodys mind right now is credit said Mark Gurley senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc one of the nations largest energy traders Aquila is based in Kansas City Mo For now Aquila and other major energy traders and producers including Rel iant Energy the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy are continuing to do busin ess with Enron And Mr Gurley said that Enrons own trading in the electri city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r eminiscent of the collapse of LongTerm Capital Management in They havent done anything tradingwise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down he said Still some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref ully at transactions with Enron especially longterm contracts They also said riskmanagement and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation Mark Palmer an Enron spokesman said on Friday that no energytrading comp any had stopped doing business with Enron He declined to say whether any o f the companys trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront For years t he details of Enrons finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company and to the investors who ow n its stock and bonds When Enrons profits were soaring and it was creatin g lucrative new markets shareholders did not seem to care about the impene trability of its financial statements Now they do Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t o the questions investors ask To others in the industry the opaqueness of the companys financial statem ents parallels Enrons efforts to keep its energytrading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements Though they do not expect En ron to crumble like LongTerm Capital Management they say that like the g iant hedge fund Enron uses a lot of debt regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet With names like Marlin and Osprey the partnerships have at least billion in bon ds outstanding backed by assets like a stake in Azurix Enrons water comp any subsidiary Enron has promised that if the partnerships debts exceed t he value of their assets Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr Fastow who was chief financial offic er when they were organized led to the billion writeoff in sharehold ers equity that Enron announced last week The company has offered only sk impy details of its transactions with those partnerships Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter after being criticized by shareholders In the process it wrote off a prom issory note that it had carried on its books reducing its shareholders eq uity by billion But because of complex accounting rules the transac tion was not apparent in Enrons quarterly earnings report The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen ts into question When Enron released thirdquarter earnings on Oct it reported a loss from billion in writeoffs on failed investments The e arnings statement did not mention the additional billion equity write down But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable a nd its shares rose In a conference call with analysts after the announcement Mr Lay Enrons chairman also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity The referenc e was a brief one however and some listeners did not catch it Those anal ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done and many were confused by the accounting procedure Enrons stock began to sli de and investors clamored for more information about the writeoff But so far the companys efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors Mr Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou t Mr Lays grasp of the situation They say that the two people at Enron w ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals Mr Skilling a nd Mr Fastow have both left the company In an interview in late August Mr Lay said he did not know some details a bout the deals involving Mr Fastow In response to one question about them he said Youre getting way over my head Mr Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr Lay did not have a gra sp of the investments at issue saying Mr Lay was handicapped in talking a bout them because of the SEC investigation There is not a whole lot w e can say or should say about them Mr Palmer said He also said the c ompany expected to generate about billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year In a conference call on Tuesday analysts pressed Mr Lay and other top Enr on executives to reveal more information about the LJM writedown and its o ther partnerships Instead they offered only vague explanations of the dea l leaving Wall Street worried that more writeoffs might be coming David Fleischer a Goldman Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c ompany was among those who came away concerned If Enron is unable to cl arify its offbalancesheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position then the company wi ll likely lose access to the capital markets he wrote in a research note after the call To try to reassure investors Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline it s Internetbased trading exchange executed more than trades that day a higherthannormal volume We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil ity with the investment community and were working on that Mr Lay s aid in a statement But in the meantime the best evidence of our strengt h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street Enr ons stock tumbled almost percent Friday to its lowest levels in six yea rs Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enrons offbalance sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston calculates tha t Enron may have close to billion in offbalancesheet debt She said th at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about billion in foreign assets including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government and she worries about t hose prospects for sale in light of Enrons problems and the souring econom y As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs they may have to write those assets down Ms Coale said On Wedne sday she downgraded her rating on Enron to sell from neutral The bottom line is its really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts Ms Coale said Shortsellers who attacked Enrons accounting even before the company disc losed the writeoff say the companys problems may run even deeper than an alysts fear Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business they s ay The company still isnt disclosing enough to know whether the core busine ss the trading business is profitable said Mark Roberts director of r esearch at Off Wall Street which recommended shorting Enrons stock on May when it stood at The issue remains why are they doing these transactions Our theory has been that the core operations arent that prof itable James Chanos a leading shortseller who has bet that Enrons stock will fa ll said Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits but hiding the losses when deals go against it Mr Palmer of Enron said the company st ood by its reported energytrading profits Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enrons positions Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr ading book balanced meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset in roughly equivalent amounts by energy it has agreed to buy With these guys they tell us and all youve got is their word that theyre hedged said Mr Verleger the economist IN fact Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an d disclosure of its trading operations Last year the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internettrading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi on Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency that oversees wholesale e lectricity and natural gas markets But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices Largescale energy trading has existed for only about a halfdozen years E nron pioneered the business and now dominates it accounting for about one quarter of all trading in the United States Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e lectricity a process that began in earnest a decade ago the power busines s was a simpler affair Utilities were given areas of monopoly service and their rates and ability to deliver enough electricity were overseen by state regulators But with the move to deregulate the business independ ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished providing an ev ergrowing portion of the nations power Beginning in the s the sale and transportation of natural gas was als o deregulated spurring Enron which used to be primarily a gaspipeline co mpany to move into the trading business The companys shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid s with the ascension of Mr Skilling who became chief executive in Fe bruary just six months before his unexpected resignation Underscoring the change in direction in securities filings this year Enron described its p rincipal business as security brokers dealers and flotation Before i t had said it was in the business of wholesalepetroleum and petroleum pr oducts For most of its ascent Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure A year ago when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr Fastow the companys former chi ef financial officer analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr Fastows involve ment Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its shortterm debt will have t o be renegotiated next spring The controversial partnerships do not have t o pay their debts until the following year unless Enron loses its invest mentgrade credit rating before that ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions which could s uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enrons cred it When LongTerm Capital was stumbling in some Wall Street rivals s old the securities they thought LongTerm owned trying to force LongTerm to sell its positions quickly and at a loss Something similar in energy ma rkets might be possible If so Enron might find as LongTerm did that po sitions that should offset each other do not Enrons new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the companys profits are real and that its condition is better than the shortsellers believe As questions are answered confidence and the share price could rebound But for now investors are skittish and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enrons plight Photos Enron which is building a new headquarters in Houston grew with d eregulation But with deregulation in doubt Enron stock has dropped

Desk Section Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch ief financial officer Andrew S Fastow beginning in the summer of B ecause they were transactions among related parties the company was requir ed to disclose them but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a nswered Following are some questions that investors are asking and the cu rrently available answers Q Why did Enron enter into the deals A Enrons first disclosures in gave no reason In later reports it said it was seeking to hedge certain merchant investments and other asse ts by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun ications companies Q How did those investments do A It looks as if they plunged in value although there is no clear disclos ure on that Q Why cant that be discerned A The company never said just what the investments were And the transacti ons with the partnerships were complicated involving a variety of derivati ve securities Enron stock and various promissory notes Enrons financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement s completely Q Why were they so complicated A One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage One a ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock If a company sells its shares at each and then buys them back whether for or there is no gain or los s But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet in tha t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in or paid out on the transactions Enrons transactions appear to have been structured to fa ll under that rule Q Who made money from these transactions A Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals although not a ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors Q If the deals began in why all the uproar now A Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof its each quarter they were willing to assume that what was not being discl osed was not really important Q When were concerns raised with Enron A The complaints grew as Enrons share price fell earlier this year By th is summer Enron decided that Mr Fastow would sell his stake in the partne rships Then because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate d to Enron the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions But investors were still worried and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships Q How did Enron do A Badly It took a million loss which given the size of the transact ions involved and the previous profits taken was not very much But it als o reduced shareholder equity by billion Q How did that happen A That like so much else is not clear But it looks as if the partnershi p owed Enron that much money could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr on In return Enron terminated previously recorded contractual obligatio ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods Enron treated that like a s hare buyback even though the shares in question had not been issued and d etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re ported earnings Q Is that legal under the accounting rules A Presumably it is But Enrons limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements while leaving profits on t hem That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission w hich has begun preliminary inquiries completes its work FLOYD NORRIS Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All

natural causes were told in a New Jersey jail cell T he Bush team didnt fully recognize that a second attack on America had beg un until more than a week after the first casualty The most highly trumpet ed breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists Tom Ridges announcem ent that the site where the letters were mailed had been found in New J ersey proved a dead end And now the president is posing with elementary school children again Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with CE O clockwork perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha t Have Changed Forever since Sept But lets not be so hasty Not every thing changes that fast least of all Washington The White Houses home front failures are not sudden unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan This is an administration that will let its special interests particular ly its highrolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right have veto power over public safety public health and economic pr udence in war it turns out no less than in peacetime When anthrax struck the administrations first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe edily as possible to protect Americans but to protect the right of pharmac eutical companies to profiteer The White Houses faith in tax cuts as a pa nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this weeks Hous e stimulus package showering million on Enron the reeling Houston energy company now under SEC investigation that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine Airport security which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept is also held hostage by campaign cash As Salon has reported Ser viceMaster a supplier of the lowwage employees who ineptly man the gates is another GOP donor Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c ats first In a display of bipartisanship Democrats lobbied by Linda Ha ll Daschle the Senate majority leaders wife joined the administration in handing the airlines a billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industrys CEOs even as they lay off tens of thous ands of their employees To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac k to its creation and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri dge Mr Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader a successful governor of a large state Pennsylvania who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam A close friend of George W Bush he should have been in the administratio n from the getgo and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job s including the vice presidency But after being pilloried by the right be cause he supports abortion rights he got zilch Instead of Mr Ridge the administration signed on the prolife John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson w ho have brought us where we are today The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations though Mr Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce gladhander who doesnt know his pants are on fire and Mr As hcroft often shakes as if hes not just seen great Caesars ghost but perha ps John Mitchells as well Both have a history of letting politics overrid e public policy that dates to the start of the administration Theyve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No concern PreSept Mr Thompson in defiance of science heartily lent his credi bility to the Bush administrations stem cell compromise by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin es it would deliver to researchers PostSept he destroyed his credibi lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat also in defiance o f science Now he maintains that the billion the administration is req uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals not shoring up local hospita ls is adequate for fighting bioterrorism This too is in defiance of a ll expert estimates including that of the one physician in the Senate the Republican Bill Frist It should also be on Mr Thompsons conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal governments house physician David Satcher the surgeon general and a muchneeded honest broker of publi c health locked away presumably because Dr Satcher a Clinton appointe e became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right Only after Mr Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula g As for Mr Ashcroft he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati on about domestic terrorism for political reasons Planned Parenthood whic h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them has s ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve r been granted one This was true not only before Sept but says Ann Gl azier Planned Parenthoods director of security remains true even thou gh her organization long targeted by such homegrown Talibans as the Army of God has a decades worth of leads on the convergence of international and domestic terrorism Ms Glazier found the sight of Mr Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy Religious extremists dont r espond to money she points out Such is the state of the FBI she add s that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days because we have so many here were afraid were going to lose it perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service s inspired anything like the confidence that say Mayor Giuliani does the re wouldnt have been a need to draft Mr Ridge Even so hes mainly a PR gimmick a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights As director of hom eland security hes allegedly charged with supervising nearly governmen t agencies so far with roughly a dozen staff members When asked to defi ne Mr Ridges responsibilities Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa s a very busy coordination job but so far Mr Ridge is mainly sowing s till more confusion The one specific duty that he has claimed in an interview with Tom Broka w was that hed be the one making the phone call to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld who made no provision fo r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr Ridges appointment Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan we ca n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here even as Mr Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali ban once expected to implode in days are proving VietConglike in their intractability The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that inst ead of a thankful Afghan population popular support for the Taliban appear s to be solidifying and anger with the US growing Maybe were losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a CEO from Madison Avenue chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head S houlders shampoo If we cant effectively fight anthrax I guess its
