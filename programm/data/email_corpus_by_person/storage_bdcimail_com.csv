the SAN Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays Focus The lure of the SAN By Amy Larsen DeCarlo Ebusiness is changing how businesses value information Information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals Companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers In this mediasaturated era information itself is packaged and sold as a product This makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial Companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations With estimates for Internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months IT professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information They often look to storagearea networks SAN as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models Today most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process IO requests from end users and other application servers In this model all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a SCSI bus This model has several shortcomings First the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus which limits the capacity of a single file server Second because the server processes each IO request it risks becoming a bottleneck Third this server model carries some daunting availability limitations because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks If that file server or any of its SCSI connections fails then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files This model carries other major disadvantages Distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl Finally this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective File server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs And because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage SANs promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers largely through consolidation of control These specialized storage networks claim higher availability faster performance centralized management and by their architecture the capability to remove bandwidthintensive data backup and recovery operations from the LAN This frees up the LAN for normal data communications and ensures smoother backup operations Using highspeed transports like Fibre Channel SANs offer a high performance network optimized for moving storage data SANs also make way for new storage implementations like LANfree backup And because Fibre Channel can support distances of up to kilometers SAN devices can be widely distributed but also centrally managed as one network Yet as was the case with LANs in their younger years SANs are still developing Vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues while companies deploying SAN technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together Ultimately the hope is that like LANs SANs will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs Given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total times the acquisition price for the equipment the consolidated management capabilities of a SAN may deliver the biggest benefit to business To contact Amy Larsen DeCarlo Amy Larsen DeCarlo is an analyst with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo a leading analyst

The storage revolution has begun Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays Focus The storage revolution has begun By Amy Larsen DeCarlo Believe the hype We are in the middle of a storage revolution Virtually overnight businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing The subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery It isnt just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage The premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements Businesses demand faulttolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees suppliers and customers But given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements on average double every months while processor speeds double every months companies are left with a quandary How can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds The simple answer to this question is to institute a wellexecuted storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs Bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems There are several ways to efficiently manage storage One of the best routes is consolidation that is pooling resources and managing storage as a system as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers This may sound like a throwback to an earlier era when enterprise storage resided on mainframes But its actually a progressive step as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning management and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files Next it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization Consequently storage requirements vary by business application As in all areas of IT it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs Businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model They want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidthintensive backup and recovery operations from the LAN Networkattached storage NAS supplies IT professionals with one answer giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data NAS devices which have been widely available for years are optimized to process IO transactions Though they promise better performance they dont remove backups from the transport network Instead they supply a relatively easytodeploy solution to cross platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments Many consider storagearea networks SAN to be the best longterm answer to current and future storage challenges Because SANs are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models Yet given the early deployment stage most companies are still in many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment This newsletter will examine how through effective storage management IT professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers This newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library Instead it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues Ultimately the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in realworld environments To contact Amy Larsen DeCarlo Amy Larsen DeCarlo is an analyst with Enterprise Management Associates in

storage By Anne Skamarock There are several ways vendors are allowing for aggregation of storage and even though they all use the word aggregation the word means different things to different companies The prospect of aggregating storage devices is intriguing but it raises several questions How much storage can I aggregate or logically collect for ease of management yet make it available to my business applications with a performance appropriate to the environment By the way once I have all this storage how do I manage it easily And does all of the storage have to be of the same typeclass or even from the same vendor Also in a perfect world I would be able to define the quality of service needed for my business application and data handling and it would all just happen But we dont live in a perfect world yet One company selling the ability to aggregate storage is XIOtech XIOtechs Magnitude storage subsystem allows customers to aggregate disks on a volume basis What this means is the server system attached to the Magnitude subsystem will see the disk volume that is presented to it Using virtualization the disk volume that is presented to the world looks like a normal disk volume when in fact it could be made up of pieces of many different disks within the Magnitude chassis or on many different Magnitude subsystems linked together The software that allows for the virtual presentation of volumes is located within the Magnitude subsystem XIOtech has partnered with Veritas to gain high performance and functionality on the server side in growing these aggregations of disk with no downtime to a business application Installation of the Magnitude subsystem requires an administrator to answer two or three questions and takes just minutes XIOtech has a leg up on the competition in its technology but because this is a fairly new company with only one base product one size must fit all In reality customers need to be able to choose the appropriate priceperformance characteristics of their storage and match it with their business applications And wouldnt it be nice to have only one storagemanagement environment for the whole enterprise from very small to very large storage Last week Tivoli announced a new initiative codenamed Storage Tank where did they get that name This initiative goes a long way in addressing endtoend storage management if Tivoli can pull it off While the Storage Tank initiative spans all areas of storagearea network SAN management aggregation is a large part of this initiative as well Within a SAN appliance that would interoperate with agents located on server systems Tivoli plans to implement capabilities similar to what XIOtech has today Again using virtualization the SAN appliance would present storage groups logical volumes to the servers The one advantage this architecture has over storage subsystem based implementations is it is both server and storagevendor agnostic Theoretically you can have many different storage subsystems behind the virtualization layer to present to your business applications running on many heterogeneous servers as you please You could in effect manage an entire enterprises storage from one place obtaining storage that was appropriate for the business need when you need it This is an admirable goal I think the road will be rocky for Tivoli for several reasons The interoperability testing for verifying that different storage subsystems play well together is a huge task Ease of installation configuration and reconfiguration will be issues as well Will current Tivoli agents need to be upgraded How much will that cost Will I have to pay consultants every time I want to trade out a subsystem for something new Even though Storage Tank holds great promise it is impossible to know if it will live up to that promise because it is not available today You will continue to hear the terms aggregation and virtualization when talking with storage and storage management vendors These concepts not only promise to make managing the plethora of storage that is or soon will be part of your enterprise much easier But they also start to move into the realm of business data and information management the true goal of businesses To contact Anne Skamarock Anne Skamarock is senior analyst with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an

myself am a strong proponent of recycling and reuse and believe that we also can use the same philosophy to solve customer problems Perhaps this is why every time I see storagearea network management software I wonder why we arent leveraging the work that has already been done for traditional networks Traditional network management is made up of hardware and software that focus on the three pillars of quality of service Availability reliability and security It seems to me that storage networks require these capabilities as much or more than traditional communications traffic Today network management tools have matured to a point where simple mapping and monitoring are not enough They are expected to not only monitor performance but also route traffic to improve the quality of service to specific platforms These tools also must provide event isolation as well as correlation capabilities that work with policy engines for automated correction andor escalation There are bandwidth capacity monitoring trending and planning facilities as well as component mapping and monitoring functions These are the customer expectations from this mature industry Well guess what these are also the customer expectations for storage networking As my colleague Mike Jude puts it The common thread through all the studies Enterprise Management Associates produces is that customers want pervasive management of the entire network infrastructure When talking with CIOs and data center managers they look at their network infrastructure and include storage as a necessary and valueadd component So Scott NcNeally Sun Microsystems CEO was right when he said The network is the computer All the functions that currently reside within the computer for monitoring prioritizing and balancing storage traffic must now be moved to the network We have a head start with the work that has been done for the traditional communications network The storage and networking industries must leverage these technologies for quick implementation of new functionality that will support storage networks as well as communications networks to provide customers the management valueadd they

read my articles regularly know how I feel about the lack of interaction between storage infrastructure management point products and the applications that use the storage in a heterogeneous environment InterSAN is addressing this issue with its recently announced Pathline product Today there are products available that can easily discover all the components on a storagearea network SAN and create a map of the components for administrators to visualize Many of these products provide environmentmonitoring capabilities much like the popular network frameworks However given a problem these products cannot take anything but the simplest course of action because they have no interaction or knowledge of the applications using the infrastructure This requires an expert administrator or two or three InterSANs Pathline product solves this problem Released for general availability last month Pathline provides the automated discovery topology rendering and event management described above and goes beyond that The product ties in the application to manage the relationship between the application and the data path through policybased automatic provisioning Well what does policybased automatic provisioning mean When storage is being allocated for an application the administrator will either select an existing policy or create one specifically for that application That policy defines the qualityofservice QoS requirements of the application Once the policy has been chosen Pathline creates the optimal data path which InterSAN calls a Virtual Private Data Path VPD from the application to the storage where the application data resides The SAN infrastructure components are configured automatically without requiring administrator interaction at the component level So what is meant by policy that defines QoS The policies describe the type of storage the connectivity and the amount of redundancy required by the application Given the policy description the VPD is created or provisioned for that QoS In conjunction with the data path description a service level requirement can be set within the policy that defines the availability objectives etc Once a service level has been added to the policy Pathline monitors and reports applicationdatapath uptime and alerts on exceptions Finally though certainly not of least importance Pathline policies allow security requirements to be described The ability to define what actions to take upon an application data path security breach provides a level of security management and enforcement currently unavailable from other software products At last the storage management market with the Pathline product is starting to integrate capabilities to provide businessrelevant management of storage and storage area

goadhtml Todays focus Software automation By Mike Karp All of us are familiar with the concept of automation automated factories automated order fulfillment from online enterprises and automated tape libraries on the computer room floor But of the many facets of automation with which we have daily contact I suggest that at least as far as IT is concerned the best automation is the automation that you never see I am of course referring to software automation What is software automation Its the builtin intelligence that some vendors are able to put into their more sophisticated products For example it may be the knowledge of experienced database administrators DBA that when made a part of a backup system enables junior DBAs to push a single button and execute complex tasks Such software might for example have a high level of understanding of the applications being protected high enough in fact that they can take advantage of the backup or restore capabilities that already exist within the applications own software A nice example of this useful feature can be found in BMCs SQLBacktrack product Such application specific intelligence when embedded within storage resource management SRM software often enables increased efficiency of operation by putting applicationspecific knowledge in the hands of newlyminted DBAs Alternatively automation could be the softwares capability to replace repetitive tasks that require a good deal of human interaction with monitoring and managing A nice example of this is certainly the ability of some business continuity software to recover automatically from interrupted backups Storage Resource Manager from Tivoli comes to mind here Reconfiguring network topologies and then tuning your management software to deal with the new environment is always both time and laborintensive A growing trend however finds new software releases with a builtin capability to analyze and understand the network topology whenever a change is made to it Thus autodiscovery of network and storage assets in Datacores virtualization software enables that companys product to dynamically manage volumes on an asneeded basis These are three very good examples of the benefit that software automation can deliver Fortunately an increasing number of other companies are also delivering of this promise Often such capabilities will prove to be a very useful differentiator when it comes to choosing a product for use in your own shop When it comes to situations that are repetitive or extremely complex or that may require fasterthanhuman interactions look for a high degree of automation in the tools you choose for your IT staff Automated management can go a long way to improving your teams capability to react quickly and with intelligence to some of their most challenging tasks The bottom line the softwares understanding of the installed application and hardware base plus its ability to exploit the capabilities of the existing infrastructure is the key To contact Mike Karp Mike Karp is senior analyst with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on

been working in IT shops since computers ran on coal brought me a beer and began to vent Its the tapes he said Theyre taking over the place Now I know this guy pretty well and I know he is a chronic complainer But I also know hes got more experience than almost anyone and hes very much a goto guy when the bit hits the fan Ultimately two things caught my interest First Roberto was taking a shot at tape backups and Im always interested in hearing about the shortcomings of tape And second this guy almost never buys the beer so he must have felt this was pretty serious We make backups of everything And then what happens We label the tapes and stuff them away in metal file cabinets We must have a mile of file cabinets each drawer filled with bar coded digital linear tapes Dont ask what happens when we have to do a recovery One look at my friend and I knew not to do the obvious At this point Roberto shook his head and went over to get two more The real problem he said on his return is that we back up just about everything Useful data and junk data Database tables and MPEGs If its on a disk we save it And the email is the worst Do you have any idea how much it costs us just to backup email At this point I think he actually groaned Well Roberto works for a huge manufacturing company and I admit I havent a clue as to what it costs his company to back up its email On the other hand Ive been using email for years or so so I at least have some context in which to think about it Which I did My first step was to do a reality check which showed me that I am part of the problem My own inbox currently contains items including that are unread and when I sort on the created field I find some of my mail goes back to July By almost anyones standards as far as email is concerned I am not a very good citizen Fortunately my IT manager a good guy if there ever was one provides me with all the data protection I need My thinking is this A sound backup rotation with tapes regularly moving to offsite storage plus an uptodate logbook in a fireproof safe will make locating the correct tape fairly easy The trick of course is to keep the log current All this is pretty obvious but I wonder how many of you actually document the content and movement of each tape But what if you need to do more than just document the problem of tape glut If you want to cure the disease rather than just treat the symptoms there are several vendors out there offering useful solutions The main issue as far as email is concerned is that the information store holding all the data is treated by the application as a monolithic block Because of this you cant do an efficient incremental backup and even if only a single message has been changed or corrupted you still have to back up the entire file Potentially you might have to back up a Gbyte file to account for a Kbyte change in the data Now new applicationsavvy software can help out by providing snapshotting capabilities for the Exchange or Notes Server For example FalconStor is about to announce a product that will allow you to set a regimen of timed snapshots that would provide the functional equivalent of incremental backups of the email information store With snapshots data is addressed in block rather than file mode Thus you can look for and save only those sectors of the file that show a change Because your tapes capture only the blocks containing changed data less data is transferred and fewer tapes are needed The result of hourly snapshots might be files of Mbytes each rather than a single daily backup of the whole multigigabyte file And to make my friend Roberto happy it could all be captured on a single tape Unless you are media manufacturers you should like that To contact Mike Karp Mike Karp is senior

Anne Skamarock Well following on from my rant last week about technology that is taking much longer than expected to come to market the discussion would not be complete without mentioning iSCSI Like InfiniBand we have been hearing about iSCSI for the last two years and have seen a plethora of demos at trade shows with little available in the market We have heard the messages and seen the marketecture slides targeted at the folks who are feeling the pain of trying to manage the evergrowing volumes of datastorage but dont have the money or the expertise to invest in another network infrastructure So they may have to upgrade their current network from BaseT to a fiber network capable of supporting G bitsec traffic as well as scale to G bitsec when that is available But they were going to do that anyway So Wheres the beef Today there are iSCSI products out there like IBMs i iSCSI storage subsystem and Ciscos SN Storage Router that are well positioned as leaders when the market takes off So what are they and the market in general waiting for Well for one companies who would participate in the iSCSI market are waiting for IETF Internet Engineering Task Force ratification of the iSCSI standard due in early Ratification of this specification will take some of the guesswork out of implementing the iSCSI protocol This is important for reducing interoperability issues that can arise Another thing the market is waiting for is host bus adapters HBA that take most if not all the TCPIP network processing off the CPU and into the HBA These HBAs handle the packaging and unpackaging of the data as it moves into and out of the application servers Having this processing take place in the HBA by specialized hardware and firmware will increase the performance of the iSCSI solution However it is important to note that HBAs are NOT required to implement an iSCSI solution using native iSCSI disk subsystems today Finally the market is waiting for volumes to increase to the point where the costs associated with the HBAs and storage subsystems as well as IP routers are reduced If the iSCSI market is targeted at departments and midsized businesses the cost structures must fit with those markets especially after the economic dip many companies experienced last year Its been mighty quiet over the last four months with regards to iSCSI Its time to start up the band once again and get those products out to the market To contact Anne Skamarock Anne Skamarock is an analyst with Enterprise Management Associates She has worked with networked storage for the last years and

Worlds FREE Town Meeting State of the LANMAN Embracing Disruptive Technologies Register today at golanhtml Todays focus News from Storage Networking World By Anne Skamarock As Storage Networking World gets underway this week in Orlando Florida my email has been overflowing with press announcements from the conference Among some of the more interesting news is Compaqs introduction of two network storage products and Brocades launch of a port switch Not one to sit still for long in the storage market Compaq has unveiled Universal Storage and the Enterprise Virtual Array EVA the first product to incorporate the vendors VersaStore technology EVA allows users to aggregate storage into multiple virtual pools that can be expanded in realtime EVA allows customers to define the data protection requirements for each of the virtual pools on a poolbypool basis Traditionally once the data protection or Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks RAID level is set for a disk subsystem that protection must be used throughout The VRAID Virtual RAID capability in the EVA allows the protection level to be specified for each pool Included in the EVA is the ability to produce snapshot copies of your data EVA supports the traditional Snap capability whereby storage space is preallocated to create the copy The technology also supports VSnap which uses space as updates are made to the data Finally EVA supports what Compaq calls Snapclones Snapclones are similar to traditional snapshots however instead of having to wait for all the data to be copied applications can access the Snapclone immediately after the Snapclone call This makes performing backups of changing data significantly easier and faster Compaqs other announcement Universal Storage is not a new concept as EMC is offering the functionality too Very simply Universal Storage allows customers to manage all their storage in a storagearea network SAN whether the data is being accessed directly by an application via blocklevel transfers through a server or by a networkattached storage appliance connected to both the local network and the SAN As with the EVA Universal Storage gives customers flexibility in managing their current storage resources as well as scalability when more storage resources are required Finally on the storagenetworking front Brocade announced a port switch the Silkworm The brings together Brocades third generation ASIC technology that supports G bitsec speeds as well as new Advanced Fabric Services The fabric services include hardware enforced zoning for greater security interswitch trunking for greater performance and reliability plus improved performance and health monitoring The latest version of Brocades API is available for storage management software vendors

storage newsletter that was sent to you on Jan and headlined How critical is your data was sent with only half of its text The full version of the article is archived at Network World Fusion and can be viewed at newslettersstorhtml We apologize for any incovenience caused Its evident that virtualization still hasnt captured the hearts and minds of the storagebuying public at this point With the technology having so much to offer it is reasonable to ask just why arent the virtualization vendors taking a serious piece of the storage revenue that is being spent these days Part of the reason and we have harped on this before is that the virtualization companies have not done a particularly good job of defining either their market space or their solutions for the worlds IT managers Another reason a bit less obvious is contained in the interesting relationship between the purchase of storagearea networks SAN and the implementation of virtualization SANs are moving into the enterprise IT space at a steady but slow pace A major cause of the slow adoption rate is attributable to the fact that most components in todays SANs despite vendors interoperability claims to the contrary have a tough time working with products from multiple vendors This means that implementing a SAN requires either going with products from a single vendor or a small group of vendors designated by the prime vendor or going through major integration and interoperability challenges every time a new device is added to the storage network As a result at this point many IT organizations are opting to go the homogeneous singlevendor route gritting their teeth as they realize that by doing so they lose a lot of financial leverage by limiting their selection of suppliers Homogeneous SANs present a problem for the virtualization vendors because one of the major benefits they can deliver is the ability to pool disks More to the point with virtualized storage the storage media can be pooled irrespective of vendors size and configurations And most to the point this pooled storage is seen as a single volume and can all be managed with a single piece of management software Applications and operating systems address the virtualized pool of data only the individual pieces of storage hardware having become in a sense invisible This opportunity for an integrated storage management console to manage the entire storage resource offers tremendous opportunities including the ability to add shut down or reassign individual elements within the virtualized pool without bringing down the rest of the storage system The bottom line with such a capability IT managers not only save by purchasing hardware from a variety of vendors they can achieve a more efficient operation by managing this mixand match collection of devices from with a single piece of software Unfortunately when selling into the homogeneous SAN environment this major costsaving benefit disappears making it harder to achieve a quick payback on the purchase of the virtualization products The values of virtualization are by no means limited to the single management console nor are they limited to SANs although that is where most of the marketing direction is placed today It seems likely that the vendors many of whom have quite a bit to offer might make themselves much more viable in this turbulent marketplace if they focused on some of the other benefits they are capable of providing In the mean time these grey days of January and February may be just the opportunity for you to start looking into all of this Note to my readers in the southern hemisphere your sunny summer days which curiously enough come at the same time of year are equally timely There are lots of players in the SAN market these days taking a

about new products and also includes a product finder function Check it out at goadhtml Todays focus How critical is your data By Mike Karp It has been said by me in a philosophical moment early in the morning on New Years Day that life is a series of accommodations Never mind what caused that sentiment at least in the data center that is probably a truism The second worst of these data center accommodations is probably the process forced upon us when we realize that backups are not going to be completed during the prescribed backup window We then have to make what often is a nowin decision continue with the backup thus running beyond the allotted window and probably degrading performance on production systems or stop the backup process when the backup window closes leaving what may be business critical data at risk of being unrecoverable The worst scenario however occurs when we have to decide just how fast a recovery we have to be prepared to do on our data We talked two weeks ago about understanding the types of data on our systems the idea being that with that intelligence we could do some intelligent decision making prior to going into the backup At that point we discussed the usefulness of flagging some file types MP for example as not worthy of being backed up Hopefully by identifying such files we would make a first step toward reducing the sheer volume of backed up data Many enterprises have a method of classifying data not based on file type but rather on some other measure Most useful among these is a metric that looks at data in terms of its criticality to business continuance This ought to be a measure with a much more useful focus than just knowing about the file extension Broadly speaking and with apologies to existential psychologist Abraham Maslow such a system looks at data on a disk as falling into one of four categories Missioncritical information the equivalent of air you cant live without it Businesscritical information think of this as water you can only go without it for a very short period of time Noncritical information food you can go without it but not for long Unclassified data probably mostly junk food but you dont really know What goes into these classifications will vary between sites as will the Recovery Time Objectives RTOs In some cases the RTO for missioncritical data may be as long as several minutes while in others particularly those relying on e commerce the situation may be seen as life threatening after a few seconds To contact Mike Karp Mike Karp is senior analyst with Enterprise Management Associates

exerted the power in at goadhtml Todays focus Storage resolutions By Anne Skamarock Most of us are resolving not make the same mistakes we did last year In that vein let me be so bold as to suggest several New Years resolutions for IT management regarding storage and management of that storage I resolve to actively deter all thought of IT being merely a cost center and promote the value of the IT organization as a vital part of the business revenue stream Information is key to business Efficient management of that information and the applications that utilize it transforms IT from a cost center that must be maintained into a vital part of the revenue chain I will not buy one more gigabyte of storage until I have a complete understanding of the capacity I currently have as well as the data stored therein With the drop in cost of disks it has become easy to just throw more storage at the problem Of course most of us have learned that the storage is relatively speaking the easy part Its the ripple effect thats strangling IT today More storage More data Longer backup windows More personnel Higher costs Being proactive within IT means understanding the current environment and both current and future requirements To understand the current environment look to storage resource management SRM software available today from companies like Sun WQuinn or NTP Software These can discover and report on your current storage capacity Some of the more sophisticated SRM tools can tell you where data duplication is occurring and flag specified file types Once I have an understanding of the current storage environment I will develop a comprehensive strategy to manage the storage the data and the people using and managing that storage Understanding the environment is the first step toward proactive management The second step is to have a plan Many SRM tools provide trend information to help evaluate capacity runrates and allow for better planning However capacity is only one of the costs associated with storage management Personnel performing tasks like provisioning backup and recovery are part of the costs of running the business Once there is a plan for storage growth its easier to assign people to the tasks Finally any storage strategy must include policies that direct user behaviors Being a user myself without limits I will consume all available storage Its not because Im evil some may challenge that statement its because I am not forced to manage my own capacity Also SRM software can help determine if users are downloading MP files and also can show if there is massive duplication of certain files I understand that the data stored on those many disk drives is one of my companys most important resources that must be protected from human error hardware failure both internal and external attacks from viruses hackers and disgruntled employees and catastrophes I resolve to create a data protection strategy that spans my business What is the survivability of my business if data are lost This is the question we all must ask ourselves Every company will answer this differently and will formulate different plans Companies such as StorageNetworks and SunGard provide offsite backup and recovery for companies that require this level of protection but dont want to develop and run their own offsite facilities With bandwidth prices dropping there has never been a better time to consider these options Even if you dont have the money for automatic offsite recovery it is prudent for every business to put together a data protection strategy starting with regular backups I will investigate solutions beyond those available from my server vendor if for no other reason than to validate the solution my server vendor has recommended Our market data suggest that most storage and storage management products continue to be purchased from server vendors This is understandable as it simplifies the many choices and gives IT management one throat to choke when things go wrong However there are many storage hardware and storage management software companies today that can provide broader storage capabilities than server vendors can Understanding those capabilities and the tradeoffs of going strictly with a server vendor allow you to make informed decisions With these five suggestions for managing storage I bid you all a

The storage revolution has begun Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays Focus The storage revolution has begun By Amy Larsen DeCarlo Believe the hype We are in the middle of a storage revolution Virtually overnight businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing The subsequent requirements are forcing companies to

demands that are changing how businesses handle storage The premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements Businesses demand faulttolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees suppliers and customers But given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements on average double every months while processor speeds double every months companies are left with a quandary How can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds The simple answer to this question is to institute a wellexecuted storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs Bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems There are several ways to efficiently manage storage One of the best routes is consolidation that is pooling resources and managing storage as a system as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers This may sound like a throwback to an earlier era when enterprise storage resided on mainframes But its actually a progressive step as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning management and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files Next it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization Consequently storage requirements vary by business application As in all areas of IT it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs

SAN Dear Wincenty Kaminski Todays Focus The lure of the SAN By Amy Larsen DeCarlo Ebusiness is changing how businesses value information Information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals Companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers In this mediasaturated era information itself is packaged and sold as a product This makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial Companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations With estimates for Internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months IT professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information They often look to storagearea networks SAN as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models Today most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process IO requests from end users and other application servers In this model all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a SCSI bus This model has several shortcomings First the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus which limits the capacity of a single file server Second because the server processes each IO request it risks becoming a bottleneck Third this server model carries some daunting availability limitations because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks If that file server or any of its SCSI connections fails then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files This model carries other major disadvantages Distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl Finally this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective File server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs And because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage SANs promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers largely through consolidation of control These specialized storage networks claim higher availability faster performance centralized management and by their architecture the capability to remove bandwidthintensive data backup and recovery operations from the LAN This frees up the LAN for normal data communications and ensures smoother backup operations Using highspeed transports like Fibre Channel SANs offer a high performance network optimized for moving storage data SANs also make way for new storage implementations like LANfree backup And because Fibre Channel can support distances of up to kilometers SAN devices can be widely distributed but also centrally managed as one network Yet as was the case with LANs in their younger years SANs are still developing Vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues while companies deploying SAN technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together Ultimately the hope is that like LANs SANs will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs Given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total times the acquisition price for the equipment the consolidated management

storage By Anne Skamarock There are several ways vendors are allowing for aggregation of storage and even though they all use the word aggregation the word means different things to different companies The prospect of aggregating storage devices is intriguing but it raises several questions How much storage can I aggregate or logically collect for ease of management yet make it available to my business applications with a performance appropriate to the environment By the way once I have all this storage how do I manage it easily And does all of the storage have to be of the same typeclass or even from the same vendor Also in a perfect world I would be able to define the quality of service needed for my business application and data handling and it would all just happen But we dont live in a perfect world yet One company selling the ability to aggregate storage is XIOtech XIOtechs Magnitude storage subsystem allows customers to aggregate disks on a volume basis What this means is the server system attached to the Magnitude subsystem will see the disk volume that is presented to it Using virtualization the disk volume that is presented to the world looks like a normal disk volume when in fact it could be made up of pieces of many different disks within the Magnitude chassis or on many different Magnitude subsystems linked together The software that allows for the virtual presentation of volumes is located within the Magnitude subsystem XIOtech has partnered with Veritas to gain high performance and functionality on the server side in growing these aggregations of disk with no downtime to a business application Installation of the Magnitude subsystem requires an administrator to answer two or three questions and takes just minutes XIOtech has a leg up on the competition in its technology but because this is a fairly new company with only one base product one size must fit all In reality customers need to be able to choose the appropriate priceperformance characteristics of their storage and match it with their business applications And wouldnt it be nice to have only one storagemanagement environment for the whole enterprise from very small to very large storage Last week Tivoli announced a new initiative codenamed Storage Tank where did they get that name This initiative goes a long way in addressing endtoend storage management if Tivoli can pull it off While the Storage Tank initiative spans all areas of storagearea network SAN management aggregation is a large part of this initiative as well Within a SAN appliance that would interoperate with agents located on server systems Tivoli plans to implement capabilities similar to what XIOtech has today Again using virtualization the SAN appliance would present storage groups logical volumes to the servers The one advantage this architecture has over storage subsystem based implementations is it is both server and storagevendor agnostic Theoretically you can have many different storage subsystems behind the virtualization layer to present to your business applications running on many heterogeneous servers as you please You could in effect manage an entire enterprises storage from one place obtaining storage that was appropriate for the business need when you need it This is an admirable goal I think the road will be rocky for Tivoli for several reasons The interoperability testing for verifying that different storage subsystems play well together is a huge task Ease of installation configuration and reconfiguration will be issues as well Will current Tivoli agents need to be upgraded How much will that cost Will I have to pay consultants every time I want to trade out a subsystem for something new Even though Storage Tank holds great promise it is impossible to know if it will live up to that promise because it is not available today You will continue to hear the terms aggregation and virtualization when talking with storage and storage management vendors These concepts not only promise to make managing the plethora of storage that is or soon will be part of your enterprise much easier But they also start to move into the realm of business data and information management the true goal of businesses To contact Anne Skamarock Anne Skamarock is senior analyst with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an

storage By Anne Skamarock There are several ways vendors are allowing for aggregation of storage and even though they all use the word aggregation the word means different things to different companies The prospect of aggregating storage devices is intriguing but it raises several questions How much storage can I aggregate or logically collect for ease of management yet make it available to my business applications with a performance appropriate to the environment By the way once I have all this storage how do I manage it easily And does all of the storage have to be of the same typeclass or even from the same vendor Also in a perfect world I would be able to define the quality of service needed for my business application and data handling and it would all just happen But we dont live in a perfect world yet One company selling the ability to aggregate storage is XIOtech XIOtechs Magnitude storage subsystem allows customers to aggregate disks on a volume basis What this means is the server system attached to the Magnitude subsystem will see the disk volume that is presented to it Using virtualization the disk volume that is presented to the world looks like a normal disk volume when in fact it could be made up of pieces of many different disks within the Magnitude chassis or on many different Magnitude subsystems linked together The software that allows for the virtual presentation of volumes is located within the Magnitude subsystem XIOtech has partnered with Veritas to gain high performance and functionality on the server side in growing these aggregations of disk with no downtime to a business application Installation of the Magnitude subsystem requires an administrator to answer two or three questions and takes just minutes XIOtech has a leg up on the competition in its technology but because this is a fairly new company with only one base product one size must fit all In reality customers need to be able to choose the appropriate priceperformance characteristics of their storage and match it with their business applications And wouldnt it be nice to have only one storagemanagement environment for the whole enterprise from very small to very large storage Last week Tivoli announced a new initiative codenamed Storage Tank where did they get that name This initiative goes a long way in addressing endtoend storage management if Tivoli can pull it off While the Storage Tank initiative spans all areas of storagearea network SAN management aggregation is a large part of this initiative as well Within a SAN appliance that would interoperate with agents located on server systems Tivoli plans to implement capabilities similar to what XIOtech has today Again using virtualization the SAN appliance would present storage groups logical volumes to the servers The one advantage this architecture has over storage subsystem based implementations is it is both server and storagevendor agnostic Theoretically you can have many different storage subsystems behind the virtualization layer to present to your business applications running on many heterogeneous servers as you please You could in effect manage an entire enterprises storage from one place obtaining storage that was appropriate for the business need when you need it This is an admirable goal I think the road will be rocky for Tivoli for several reasons The interoperability testing for verifying that different storage subsystems play well together is a huge task Ease of installation configuration and reconfiguration will be issues as well Will current Tivoli agents need to be upgraded How much will that cost Will I have to pay consultants every time I want to trade out a subsystem for something new Even though Storage Tank holds great promise it is impossible to know if it will live up to that promise because it is not available today You will continue to hear the terms aggregation and virtualization when talking with storage and storage management vendors These concepts not only promise to make managing the plethora of storage that is or soon will be part of your enterprise much easier But they also start to move into the realm of business data and information management the true goal of businesses To contact Anne Skamarock Anne Skamarock is senior analyst with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder Colo an
