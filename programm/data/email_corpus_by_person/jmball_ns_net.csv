MalinowskiBall Edson Modisette RE Legislative Status Report Week Ending RECENT EVENTS IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos t of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB x SB x SherBattin makes various changes to the siting process including many IEPsponsored proposals As you will recall two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities Per the direction from IEP member companies IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue If the provision remained in the bill IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position We were however given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability With these amendments including some cleanup language SB x will be votedon on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday The final version will include the following IEPsponsored proposals Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements Substituting CEQAstyle hearings for the triallike proceedings of the CE C Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB Since SB x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process IEP member should now be thinking about what is next IEP proposals still on the table include Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance Giving deference to other state and regional agencies Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements Bad news on the California First issue quickly followed the good news The CEC staff analysis which said the State cant require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a tradeoff for expedited permitting was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorneyclient privilege This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project AB x Hertzberg which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CECs decision on AES although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burtons office on amendm ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB x Burton which is the State Power Authority measure Attached is a copy o f the bill in PDF form The agreed upon language which clarifies that the Authoritys purpose is to supplement existing generation activities can be found on pages Section Section and Section Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets this was most likely the best we could get The first of Senator Dunns hearings with the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week This week and next weeks topics

Julee MalinowskiBall Re Legislative Status Report Week Ending RECENT EVENTS Rule Never assume an issue is done until the ink is dry from the Governors signature and even then you never know The Senate Republicans agreed late this week to oppose SB x Sher which makes several IEPsponsored proposals to the siting process due to a controversial provision added in the Assembly Appropriations Committee regarding unemployment compensation Assembly Republicans let it slide on process because CMTA and the Chambers objections to the egregious language was so last minute Senate Republicans had more time to look at the issue and agreed not to let it go forward Since they control of the final vote in a bill requiring twothirds their united opposition stopped the bill one vote shy The author was granted reconsideration and discussions will be ongoing over the next week on how to proceed The bestcase scenario at this point is getting one Republican to drop from the ranks Worstcase scenario is the bill dies and our language gets picked up in another vehicle starting the whole process all over again The more likely scenario however lies somewhere in between Parties will agree to some compromise language send the bill back to the Assembly to make the appropriate changes then bring it back to the Senate for a clean vote Longterm contracting was moved to the front burner this week by Asm Wright AB and Senator Morrow SB both with different results Both measures which are almost identical set forth a criteria which if followed by an IOU when signing a longterm contract with an energy supplier would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the CPUC AB passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee with little discussion and a few technical amendments SB faced a longer more difficult hearing in front of Senator Bowens Energy Committee IEP along with the three IOUs testified in support of the measure while TURN expressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the CPUC out of the picture In the end the Senate committee agreed to put the bill off for further discussions passed a motion in support of getting the appropriate rule waver so the bill can be heard again after Fridays policy committee deadline and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for Thursday morning Senator Burton announced on the Senate Floor Thursday morning however that all requests for rule wavers would be denied AB appears to be the only active vehicle on this issue and IEP will be at the negotiating table providing input on the language as it moves forward AB x is scheduled for hearing next week in the Senate Energy Committee IEP met with committee staff this week which revealed some possible latitude in amending the bill IEP and other member company lobbyists will be pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committee before the hearing Tuesday afternoon At this time however we do not have any alternative language for the bill After further review by some IEP member companies the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable and were withdrawn from consideration We anticipate on waiting to see where the committee on Tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at drafting alternative language SB x SotoScott was amended this week before its hearing in the Senate Appropriations committee next week The new language finds a backdoor to the price cap issue by imposing a percent tax on the sale of electric power that exceeds a base price of per MWhr CMTA the Chamber and CalTax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with IEP and the generators but despite the bills multiple constitutional and legal problems most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble A new player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony InterGen North America which is developing a MW power plant in Palm Springs plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the Governor they will absolutely pull the project and go to Oklahoma Newly amended this week is AB x Cardoza which now makes it a felony for a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust or unreasonable rates Sponsored by Lt Governor Bustamante the measure establishes stiff fines and possible jail time that could be subject to the states three strikes law AB x has already generated opposition from Republicans and constitutional questions from legal experts Although Cardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and could change the intent will remain the same and he insists that energy companies that take advantage of Californians will still face significant penalties SB x Burton which establishes a State Power Authority passed the Assembly this week by a to vote The measure needs the Senate

Reduce Prices Issue Refunds GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNORS CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES Calls on Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices Issue Refunds SAN DIEGO At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC hearing today in San Diego Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators to intervene to the fullest extent possible to lower electricity prices in California FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and Californias economy are subjected to unconstrained marketbased electricity prices said Governor Davis in a statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn Consequently I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action in recent weeks to provide rate relief While these actions should provide shortterm rate predictability and longerterm benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address said the governor No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems of Californias wholesale markets Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising electricity prices in San Diego On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergency and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on the price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm On August Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies On August Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas Electric The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between and homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by percent during Stage One emergencies On August Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to expedite FERCs investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust On August Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising electricity bills On August President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request by releasing million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The President also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases On August Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers The governor signed two bills into law on September Please see attached letter below SEPTEMBER STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA The Summer of has confronted California with an electricity crisis that seriously threatens the safety health and well being of citizens and businesses throughout the state At the heart of the crisis is the extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary services accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability In San Diego electric customers bills have more than doubled this summer threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of residential customers in the warm southern climate All remaining California electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate freeze periods come to an end In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for the first time in our history As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident I directed California regulators including the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight Board and the Independent System Operator to take immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the damage including restoring price caps at Summer levels I am happy to report that those measures have been adopted although not without considerable resistance from selfinterested parties In recent weeks I have worked with the California Legislature to enact further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the state These include provisions to stabilize retail rates expedite generation licensing where possible implement targeted demand reduction and demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution systems I have also established a task force comprised of key state officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies While these actions should provide shortterm rate predictability and longerterm benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems in Californias wholesale markets A joint report submitted to me on August nd by the Chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by sellers Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions Subsequent behavior of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions and subjects California to further economic damage While I remain hopeful that California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public I cannot and will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current situation for even a short period I intend to take any and all steps necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service infrastructure of California FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and reasonable wholesale electric rates FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and Californias economy are subjected to unconstrained marketbased electricity prices Consequently I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power OFFICE OF THE

Reduce Prices Issue Refunds GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNORS CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES Calls on Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices Issue Refunds SAN DIEGO At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC hearing today in San Diego Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators to intervene to the fullest extent possible to lower electricity prices in California FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and Californias economy are subjected to unconstrained marketbased electricity prices said Governor Davis in a statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn Consequently I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action in recent weeks to provide rate relief While these actions should provide shortterm rate predictability and longerterm benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address said the governor No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems of Californias wholesale markets Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising electricity prices in San Diego On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergency and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on the price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm On August Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies On August Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas Electric The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between and homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by percent during Stage One emergencies On August Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to expedite FERCs investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust On August Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising electricity bills On August President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request by releasing million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The President also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases On August Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers The governor signed two bills into law on September Please see attached letter below SEPTEMBER STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA The Summer of has confronted California with an electricity crisis that seriously threatens the safety health and well being of citizens and businesses throughout the state At the heart of the crisis is the extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary services accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability In San Diego electric customers bills have more than doubled this summer threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of residential customers in the warm southern climate All remaining California electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate freeze periods come to an end In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for the first time in our history As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident I directed California regulators including the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight Board and the Independent System Operator to take immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the damage including restoring price caps at Summer levels I am happy to report that those measures have been adopted although not without considerable resistance from selfinterested parties In recent weeks I have worked with the California Legislature to enact further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the state These include provisions to stabilize retail rates expedite generation licensing where possible implement targeted demand reduction and demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution systems I have also established a task force comprised of key state officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies While these actions should provide shortterm rate predictability and longerterm benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems in Californias wholesale markets A joint report submitted to me on August nd by the Chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by sellers Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions Subsequent behavior of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions and subjects California to further economic damage While I remain hopeful that California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public I cannot and will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current situation for even a short period I intend to take any and all steps necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service infrastructure of California FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and reasonable wholesale electric rates FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and Californias economy are subjected to unconstrained marketbased electricity prices Consequently I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power OFFICE OF THE

Julee MalinowskiBall Re Legislative Status Report Week Ending RECENT EVENTS Rule Never assume an issue is done until the ink is dry from the Governors signature and even then you never know The Senate Republicans agreed late this week to oppose SB x Sher which makes several IEPsponsored proposals to the siting process due to a controversial provision added in the Assembly Appropriations Committee regarding unemployment compensation Assembly Republicans let it slide on process because CMTA and the Chambers objections to the egregious language was so last minute Senate Republicans had more time to look at the issue and agreed not to let it go forward Since they control of the final vote in a bill requiring twothirds their united opposition stopped the bill one vote shy The author was granted reconsideration and discussions will be ongoing over the next week on how to proceed The bestcase scenario at this point is getting one Republican to drop from the ranks Worstcase scenario is the bill dies and our language gets picked up in another vehicle starting the whole process all over again The more likely scenario however lies somewhere in between Parties will agree to some compromise language send the bill back to the Assembly to make the appropriate changes then bring it back to the Senate for a clean vote Longterm contracting was moved to the front burner this week by Asm Wright AB and Senator Morrow SB both with different results Both measures which are almost identical set forth a criteria which if followed by an IOU when signing a longterm contract with an energy supplier would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the CPUC AB passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee with little discussion and a few technical amendments SB faced a longer more difficult hearing in front of Senator Bowens Energy Committee IEP along with the three IOUs testified in support of the measure while TURN expressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the CPUC out of the picture In the end the Senate committee agreed to put the bill off for further discussions passed a motion in support of getting the appropriate rule waver so the bill can be heard again after Fridays policy committee deadline and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for Thursday morning Senator Burton announced on the Senate Floor Thursday morning however that all requests for rule wavers would be denied AB appears to be the only active vehicle on this issue and IEP will be at the negotiating table providing input on the language as it moves forward AB x is scheduled for hearing next week in the Senate Energy Committee IEP met with committee staff this week which revealed some possible latitude in amending the bill IEP and other member company lobbyists will be pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committee before the hearing Tuesday afternoon At this time however we do not have any alternative language for the bill After further review by some IEP member companies the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable and were withdrawn from consideration We anticipate on waiting to see where the committee on Tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at drafting alternative language SB x SotoScott was amended this week before its hearing in the Senate Appropriations committee next week The new language finds a backdoor to the price cap issue by imposing a percent tax on the sale of electric power that exceeds a base price of per MWhr CMTA the Chamber and CalTax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with IEP and the generators but despite the bills multiple constitutional and legal problems most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble A new player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony InterGen North America which is developing a MW power plant in Palm Springs plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the Governor they will absolutely pull the project and go to Oklahoma Newly amended this week is AB x Cardoza which now makes it a felony for a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust or unreasonable rates Sponsored by Lt Governor Bustamante the measure establishes stiff fines and possible jail time that could be subject to the states three strikes law AB x has already generated opposition from Republicans and constitutional questions from legal experts Although Cardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and could change the intent will remain the same and he insists that energy companies that take advantage of Californians will still face significant penalties SB x Burton which establishes a State Power Authority passed the Assembly this week by a to vote The measure needs the Senate

completion of the retrofits by July or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability With these amendments including some cleanup language SB x will be votedon on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday The final version will include the following IEPsponsored proposals Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements Substituting CEQAstyle hearings for the triallike proceedings of the CE C Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB Since SB x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process IEP member should now be thinking about what is next IEP proposals still on the table include Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance Giving deference to other state and regional agencies Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements Bad news on the California First issue quickly followed the good news The CEC staff analysis which said the State cant require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a tradeoff for expedited permitting was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorneyclient privilege This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project AB x Hertzberg which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CECs decision on AES although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burtons office on amendm ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB x Burton which is the State Power Authority measure Attached is a copy o f the bill in PDF form The agreed upon language which clarifies that the Authoritys purpose is to supplement existing generation
