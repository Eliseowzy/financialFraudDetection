requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate Assembly or a committee may be issued by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Govt Code Section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the Senate Assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt Govt Code Section If the contempt is committed while the Legislature is in session Govt Code Section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or Assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or Assembly If the Legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled Govt Code Section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested It is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company Motion to Quash Subpoena California courts have held under CCP Section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum See eg People ex rel Dept of Public Works v Younger CalAppd My research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting Govt Code et seq Therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the Enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate Enron documents Here are the threshold questions A Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt Code Section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action B Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing subpoenas generally ie CCP et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie CCP et seq This is a tossup and the answer may well be both The Government Code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to CCP et seq subpoenas generally However the deposition subpoena provisions CCP et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the Senator seems to be undertaking Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to a California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents It is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from nonCalifornia Enron entities This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq Additional threshold question If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the State is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect Enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the case should be removable to federal court In People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Statutes Cal Bus Prof Code and The District Court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the State of California Id at Therefore for the purposes of the Unfair Competition Claims the Court found that the State of California was the real party in interest The Court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action Id Specifically the Court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant Eg Strawbridge v Curtiss US Cranch LEd Here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the State of California is not a citizen of any state Id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution The Eleventh Amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court It is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar Defendant relying on the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the United States because the State is the plaintiff However since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant Id internal citations removed However the Court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim Id If a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against Enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Generally in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the District Courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals the Ninth Circuit has said Our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution While it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see United States v Pacific A Ry Navigation Co US United States v Yellow Freight Sys th Cir Fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases We said in a related context We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States In general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney General In re Subpoena of Persico Fd d Cir quoting United States v Cox Fd th Cir Wisdom J concurring Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility See Case v Bowles US SCt LEd Nader v Saxbe USAppDC Fd n DCCir FTC v Guignon Fd th Cir But to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will United States v Morgan US SCt LEd United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd th Cir cert denied US SCt LEdd United States v General Dynamics Corp th Cir Fd The General Dynamics Court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses Id In another context the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the Attorney Generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the Act On the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry DDC FSupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected Therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against Enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act are relatively limited In addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the Federal Power Act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to the Power Commission FERCs predecessor Pennsylvania Water Power Co v Consolidated Gas Electric Light Power Co th Cir Fd I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments In other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by FERC would State law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded Further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive Also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the Federal Power Act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in

<18114421.1075853226549.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mlk@pkns.com,2001-06-11 07:53:00,Union Tribune Editorial Sunday June Lynch President California Public Utilities Commission June Lynch was appointed March Previously she was director of Gov Gray Davis Office of Planning and Research Question What is this summer going to be like in terms of blackouts What is the economic impact going to be Answer I dont think anybody can predict They are wild guesses or at least estimates based on assumptions that we dont know Three factors influence the level of blackouts One is how hot its going to be The second is conservation and whether folks will really step up to the plate both business and residences and conserve their hearts out and load shift to nonpeak times We reduced the load to percent in March and April and slightly more percent in May Were going to have to do better than that to avoid blackouts The third factor is making sure that the generation that can run does run and right now were doing an abysmal job of that We have record levels of unplanned outages at generating plants This week megawatts were out of megawatts megawatts including municipal utilities in state capacity Historically there has only been to megawatts off at any one time Does the PUC have no control over when utilities take a plant off line Utilities yes private generators no Since November the unplanned outages have been three four times what history would show over a year period Exactly what explains that is the heart of one of our investigations What can the PUC do about it We have been in the plants since midJanuary In January we had days of stage alerts two days of stage in days We started going in those plants although weve had lots of difficulty getting into plants on time and most importantly getting the operations and maintenance logs Why dont you get an injunction from a judge to tell the private companies they have to give the PUC everything it wants Frankly because in this last day period I was trying to not be that aggressive I was trying to work it out with these generators And we have made significant movement with some of those generators Is it illegal for a privately owned power company to shut down in order to drive up prices Isnt that the multibillion dollar question Thats where you match you legal theories Is the PUC joining in any of these legal actions against FERC and the private power generators You know we actually asked for help from FERC in getting data from generators because FERC has wide access to all sorts of market data I talked to former chairman James Hoecker directly in September He said No problem You just send us your data request and well make sure they comply But we had no informal help from the FERC and so we filed a motion in November I believe for FERC to compel those people under its jurisdiction to give us basic documents FERC has yet to move on those motions to compel Is the PUC is joining in any of the civil actions At this point we havent joined in the private civil lawsuits What else can the PUC do Well theres a ton of stuff that the PUC does in front of FERC We appear on electricity and natural gas issues and we continue to file formal complaints to that administrative agency For instance it was the PUC that brought the complaint at FERC against El Paso Corp three weeks after I became president of the PUC We complained about anticompetitive activity We have brought all the motions at FERC to prevent the generators from reupping their market price authority If FERC does nothing and allows this marketbased rate authority to continue what would you do California is experiencing the real time consequences of justice delayed is justice denied Eventually the administrative procedure act would allow us to go to court but frankly a variety of utilities and other folks have been trying to kick it up to either the DC Circuit or the th Circuit Preliminary responses from the courts have been that they have failed to exhaust administrative remedies Whats in store for San Diego in terms of price hikes Bottom line its unrealistic to think that San Diego can continue to be charged in the to cent range when everybody else now is being charged in the to cent range But I cant prejudge the level because were just starting to hear the evidence How do you think the escrow accounts our individual charge accounts with SDGE are going to shake down eventually Frankly thats an issue thats also before the commission What the legislation clearly says is that theres this balancing account that San Diego is billing things into as a regulatory accounting matter but thats not the end of the inquiry They put the money in and they charge it to a regulatory account and then they come to the PUC Then the PUC judges the reasonableness of those charges And the separate watch dog component of the PUC the Office of Ratepayer Advocates has done some preliminary analysis on SDGEs charges up through I believe August of and has questioned a large percentage of those charges as unreasonable because of SDGEs failure to hedge when they had hedging opportunities Utility executives criticize the PUC on two major counts They say only half the utility plants had to be divested but the PUC set the rate of return and other restrictions in such a fashion that it really encouraged utilities to dispose of the other half Second they say that when the PUC eventually allowed them to enter longterm contracts it did not spell out procedures in case the contracts turned out to be unfortunate moves How would you respond The first part wasnt on my watch in terms of the rate of return That was set by the prior PUC However on that question of rate of return and percent versus more I think SDGE is a little separately situated because I do think there were some encouragement of SDGE selling off in order to be able to merge The rate of return may have been lower than the utilities wanted And the criticism about longterm contracts I think the longterm contract issue has been painted in simplistic terms and its not a simplistic question When the utilities came to the commission in seeking permission the commission acted faster than it usually acts On July of last year PGE and Edison came to the commission and said they wanted authority to enter into direct bilateral contracts By Aug we said yes But they claim that you did not give them the ground rules Oh we certainly did We applied the historic reasonableness test But they wanted an upfront guarantee that they would not be secondguessed and my concern on that was heightened because they have all these unregulated subsidiaries Because theyre now energy trading in the market The facts are they did enter contracts and we can show you the contracts they entered into in August September October and November of last year When Californias deregulation law was being shaped why was nobody concerned about abuse of market power by the private generating companies It is truly astonishing and I believe its because of an ideological bias from my predecessors who said Well we will have a flood of competition into this market because its just a commodity But in fact this commodity is uniquely situated to not have a flood of competition because you have high capital barriers to entry You have long lead times to increase supply Its a fundamental economic necessity which cant be stored and you cant choose not to buy it theres no effective substitute Other states such as Texas and Pennsylvania appear to be doing deregulation right Do you believe it can be done right I think the jurys out on that question Texas started from a position of supply and is energy independent and does not report to the FERC in terms of its own intrastate transmission grid Pennsylvania already had an integrated utility sharing relationship with other states The utilities had buyback contracts with the plants that they sold so that they got longterm contracts at the time of sale The utilities also sold a much smaller percentage of their plants I say California went the farthest fastest with the least amount of safeguards In retrospect what was the central flaw in this deregulation plan The central flaw was not to realize the market power would be exercised by the sellers of a fundamental economic necessity for which there is no effective substitute In the current argument over temporary price caps the Bush administration says this might diminish shortterm pain but in the long term would discourage new supply Whats your reaction to that My reaction is price caps or costbased pricing is an absolute economic necessity for California The market is broken Regardless of who broke it and how it broke its broken maybe irrevocably Until we can make a market work here we must have some protection for our economy We really are going back a hundred years and reaching back these companies are recreating the kinds of trust that led to trust busting The economy cant withstand this and in terms of the supply argument yeah supply is a state issue Gov Davis is streamlining and we have all these plants being built and plus we are conserving like never before We have supply coming on line its being built its not being abandoned and if it were abandoned in the unlikely event the people that sunk in hundreds of millions of dollars into an investment decided to walk and abandon their investment which isnt rational economic behavior then the utilities could take those over and build it at costbased building or the power authority or whoever Most of those plants entered the permitting process when the price cap was a megawatt Talking about rational behavior its certainly in the political and economic interest of the Bush administration not to see Californias economy go in the tank not to see the economy of the whole West Coast be hammered and suffer accordingly If you presume rational behavior on their part youd have to presume that theyre doing what they think is the right thing But once again its a question of are you going to stand on your ideology regardless of all facts to the contrary or are you going to try and fix given the actual facts that are at play in that market I think even the most committed free market person if theyre principled recognizes that you need a market cop in any market This markets being gamed in a myriad of ways Are you getting anywhere with the FERC in making the arguments that youre stating here The question right now is who is the FERC I have not met formally with the two new FERC commissioners since theyve been confirmed which just occurred last week I look forward to a transition period where the FERC gets off its ideology and gets back to practicality and doing its job as a regulator Will that happen as long as George Bush and Dick Cheney are saying quite the opposite California needs to do what it needs to do to protect itself but I do think we may have an opportunity in transition We cant count on it but we shouldnt close the door to it The new electricity plants coming on line for the most part are natural gasfired Would we still be in a crunch if natural gas prices remain high The PUC has been doing everything it possibly can in the last two months and will continue to do it in the next several months to encourage utilities to add natural gas infrastructure The other thing is they have to inject natural gas into storage right now even though we know that the price of natural gas is too high California is being gouged on natural gas Isnt everybody else being gouged on natural gas prices No God no Prices at the California border are two to three times higher than anyplace else in the country The problem here is the El Paso line is the market maker for the price of gas coming in to California because of anticompetitive behavior which I believe was intentional to raise prices That evidence is being heard at the FERC right now Are you expecting anything from that administrative law judge at FERC We have to be hopeful The astonishing thing here is that we California cannot count on the federal government

ContentDisposition inline IS TRADING AN INSIDERS GAME Buying selling of electricity is a growth business but some say deck is stacked against consumers By Craig D Rose STAFF WRITER June While Californians decry deregulations failure to deliver a competitive market electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly growing business of buying and selling power among themselves The deals take place on hightech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere around the country as well as on Internetbased trading systems Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising consumer power prices yet its largely unregulated Electricity trading is like buying stock when you have ability to change the stock price said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor and member of the state grid operators market surveillance group Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power provides risk management allowing plant owners to presell their electricity lock in prices and avoid fluctuations The rough and tumble of the free market they add is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like electricity But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm In their view its a means of communication a way for energy insiders to collude and raise prices under the guise of competition To be sure the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars in an industry where profit surges of percent or percent are not uncommon The transactions shrouded in secrecy can leave ownership of a critical commodity in unknown hands Consider the case of power generated by AES Corps California plants In AES made a bold move Immediately after purchasing power plants that gave it control of percent of the states electric generating capacity the company sold the output from its plants for the next years to Williams Cos Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons The Tulsa Okla company soon sold percent of what it bought It is difficult to say who owns that power now Some might be owned by Sempra Trading a sister company of SDGE Or some could be owned by Enron Corp the nations biggest electricity trader A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased some of the electricity it sold earlier But trading companies closely guard their positions This much can be said with certainty Electricity that AES sold for less than cents per kilowatthour to Williams changed hands perhaps times in the wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for consumers that was percent higher Williams trading profits increased by percent in the first quarter this year Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companies such as Duke Energy operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and others in the state frequently note that they sell most of their electricity far in advance But they acknowledge less often that their trading units may also be buying power which could boost the companys electricity inventory Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits which soared percent in the first quarter to million It is a companys power traders who frequently direct plant operators to increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits One of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production side of the business For one thing electricity is a commodity power from one company is indistinguishable from that generated by others More important nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built by a handful of manufacturers The result Modern plants owned by different companies produce power at nearly identical cost The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil onethousandth of a dollar said Michael Peevey an adviser to Gov Gray Davis and former president of Southern California Edison So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on trading Traders profits rise when prices are volatile plunging or even better rising sharply Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market the burgeoning electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from energy traders but these often provide incomplete information or at least little that has been of concern to FERC In fact although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold from to FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a trader After the onset of the California crisis last year FERC has acted once That was against Williams which agreed to pay million without admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up prices FERCs record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations But William Massey a FERC commissioner says the agencys effort is still inadequate Electricity can be flipped stripped and chopped up Massey said Its an extraordinarily complicated market The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us Were kind of horse and buggy in our approach and theyre out there in rocket ships flying around The problem is that sophisticated traders dont necessarily produce reasonable prices They produce profits Before deregulation electricity trading was a lowkey affair Regulated utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill electricity shortfalls in their control areas There was little trading for profit until the mids after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened the market Major traders include large energy companies sister companies of Californias major utilities and Wall Street firms Market volatility In many ways the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities But there are important differences Because it cannot be stored and its use is so fundamental the price of electricity is the most volatile of all When supplies are tight a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to budgetbusting levels as evidenced by Duke Energys recent admission that it charged California nearly for a megawatthour of power a quantity that probably sold hours earlier for onetenth of that sum or less Wolak the Stanford economist and state Sen Joseph Dunn DGarden Grove who is investigating the state power market say trading allows companies to collude under the guise of competition Instead of wringing out lowest costs the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices they say As I trade to you and you trade to me we communicate to each other what price we would like to get said Wolak Its not collusive Its just communicating price Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron the nations biggest power trader said Californias problem is not the result of trading Its a result of shortages Palmer said Underscoring its emphasis on trading Enrons new headquarters tower in downtown Houston rises from a sixstory block of new trading floors including expanded space for electricity trading Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims to be the most active computerbased trading market The Houston company argues that consumers wont fully benefit from power trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their power supplier And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access to transmission lines which would allow traders to move power around the country To that end Enron has lobbied hard for President Bushs plan for a national electricity grid Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is traded is mistaken The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity Palmer said Dunn the California state senator says his investigation found a different function for trading At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of demand he noted companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about how high to set their price The trader is a pawn in the generators game to drive up prices said Dunn Trading develops a level of trust You my alleged competitor will bid in the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a complimentary pattern The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up without being undercut by competitors This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test of market power the technical term for manipulation or price fixing But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in court He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of antitrust violations it remains anticompetitive and devastating for the California economy To Harry Trebing a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at Michigan State University wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of what took place in

<5838298.1075853244305.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mlk@pkns.com,2001-06-11 07:53:00,Union Tribune Editorial Sunday June Lynch President California Public Utilities Commission June Lynch was appointed March Previously she was director of Gov Gray Davis Office of Planning and Research Question What is this summer going to be like in terms of blackouts What is the economic impact going to be Answer I dont think anybody can predict They are wild guesses or at least estimates based on assumptions that we dont know Three factors influence the level of blackouts One is how hot its going to be The second is conservation and whether folks will really step up to the plate both business and residences and conserve their hearts out and load shift to nonpeak times We reduced the load to percent in March and April and slightly more percent in May Were going to have to do better than that to avoid blackouts The third factor is making sure that the generation that can run does run and right now were doing an abysmal job of that We have record levels of unplanned outages at generating plants This week megawatts were out of megawatts megawatts including municipal utilities in state capacity Historically there has only been to megawatts off at any one time Does the PUC have no control over when utilities take a plant off line Utilities yes private generators no Since November the unplanned outages have been three four times what history would show over a year period Exactly what explains that is the heart of one of our investigations What can the PUC do about it We have been in the plants since midJanuary In January we had days of stage alerts two days of stage in days We started going in those plants although weve had lots of difficulty getting into plants on time and most importantly getting the operations and maintenance logs Why dont you get an injunction from a judge to tell the private companies they have to give the PUC everything it wants Frankly because in this last day period I was trying to not be that aggressive I was trying to work it out with these generators And we have made significant movement with some of those generators Is it illegal for a privately owned power company to shut down in order to drive up prices Isnt that the multibillion dollar question Thats where you match you legal theories Is the PUC joining in any of these legal actions against FERC and the private power generators You know we actually asked for help from FERC in getting data from generators because FERC has wide access to all sorts of market data I talked to former chairman James Hoecker directly in September He said No problem You just send us your data request and well make sure they comply But we had no informal help from the FERC and so we filed a motion in November I believe for FERC to compel those people under its jurisdiction to give us basic documents FERC has yet to move on those motions to compel Is the PUC is joining in any of the civil actions At this point we havent joined in the private civil lawsuits What else can the PUC do Well theres a ton of stuff that the PUC does in front of FERC We appear on electricity and natural gas issues and we continue to file formal complaints to that administrative agency For instance it was the PUC that brought the complaint at FERC against El Paso Corp three weeks after I became president of the PUC We complained about anticompetitive activity We have brought all the motions at FERC to prevent the generators from reupping their market price authority If FERC does nothing and allows this marketbased rate authority to continue what would you do California is experiencing the real time consequences of justice delayed is justice denied Eventually the administrative procedure act would allow us to go to court but frankly a variety of utilities and other folks have been trying to kick it up to either the DC Circuit or the th Circuit Preliminary responses from the courts have been that they have failed to exhaust administrative remedies Whats in store for San Diego in terms of price hikes Bottom line its unrealistic to think that San Diego can continue to be charged in the to cent range when everybody else now is being charged in the to cent range But I cant prejudge the level because were just starting to hear the evidence How do you think the escrow accounts our individual charge accounts with SDGE are going to shake down eventually Frankly thats an issue thats also before the commission What the legislation clearly says is that theres this balancing account that San Diego is billing things into as a regulatory accounting matter but thats not the end of the inquiry They put the money in and they charge it to a regulatory account and then they come to the PUC Then the PUC judges the reasonableness of those charges And the separate watch dog component of the PUC the Office of Ratepayer Advocates has done some preliminary analysis on SDGEs charges up through I believe August of and has questioned a large percentage of those charges as unreasonable because of SDGEs failure to hedge when they had hedging opportunities Utility executives criticize the PUC on two major counts They say only half the utility plants had to be divested but the PUC set the rate of return and other restrictions in such a fashion that it really encouraged utilities to dispose of the other half Second they say that when the PUC eventually allowed them to enter longterm contracts it did not spell out procedures in case the contracts turned out to be unfortunate moves How would you respond The first part wasnt on my watch in terms of the rate of return That was set by the prior PUC However on that question of rate of return and percent versus more I think SDGE is a little separately situated because I do think there were some encouragement of SDGE selling off in order to be able to merge The rate of return may have been lower than the utilities wanted And the criticism about longterm contracts I think the longterm contract issue has been painted in simplistic terms and its not a simplistic question When the utilities came to the commission in seeking permission the commission acted faster than it usually acts On July of last year PGE and Edison came to the commission and said they wanted authority to enter into direct bilateral contracts By Aug we said yes But they claim that you did not give them the ground rules Oh we certainly did We applied the historic reasonableness test But they wanted an upfront guarantee that they would not be secondguessed and my concern on that was heightened because they have all these unregulated subsidiaries Because theyre now energy trading in the market The facts are they did enter contracts and we can show you the contracts they entered into in August September October and November of last year When Californias deregulation law was being shaped why was nobody concerned about abuse of market power by the private generating companies It is truly astonishing and I believe its because of an ideological bias from my predecessors who said Well we will have a flood of competition into this market because its just a commodity But in fact this commodity is uniquely situated to not have a flood of competition because you have high capital barriers to entry You have long lead times to increase supply Its a fundamental economic necessity which cant be stored and you cant choose not to buy it theres no effective substitute Other states such as Texas and Pennsylvania appear to be doing deregulation right Do you believe it can be done right I think the jurys out on that question Texas started from a position of supply and is energy independent and does not report to the FERC in terms of its own intrastate transmission grid Pennsylvania already had an integrated utility sharing relationship with other states The utilities had buyback contracts with the plants that they sold so that they got longterm contracts at the time of sale The utilities also sold a much smaller percentage of their plants I say California went the farthest fastest with the least amount of safeguards In retrospect what was the central flaw in this deregulation plan The central flaw was not to realize the market power would be exercised by the sellers of a fundamental economic necessity for which there is no effective substitute In the current argument over temporary price caps the Bush administration says this might diminish shortterm pain but in the long term would discourage new supply Whats your reaction to that My reaction is price caps or costbased pricing is an absolute economic necessity for California The market is broken Regardless of who broke it and how it broke its broken maybe irrevocably Until we can make a market work here we must have some protection for our economy We really are going back a hundred years and reaching back these companies are recreating the kinds of trust that led to trust busting The economy cant withstand this and in terms of the supply argument yeah supply is a state issue Gov Davis is streamlining and we have all these plants being built and plus we are conserving like never before We have supply coming on line its being built its not being abandoned and if it were abandoned in the unlikely event the people that sunk in hundreds of millions of dollars into an investment decided to walk and abandon their investment which isnt rational economic behavior then the utilities could take those over and build it at costbased building or the power authority or whoever Most of those plants entered the permitting process when the price cap was a megawatt Talking about rational behavior its certainly in the political and economic interest of the Bush administration not to see Californias economy go in the tank not to see the economy of the whole West Coast be hammered and suffer accordingly If you presume rational behavior on their part youd have to presume that theyre doing what they think is the right thing But once again its a question of are you going to stand on your ideology regardless of all facts to the contrary or are you going to try and fix given the actual facts that are at play in that market I think even the most committed free market person if theyre principled recognizes that you need a market cop in any market This markets being gamed in a myriad of ways Are you getting anywhere with the FERC in making the arguments that youre stating here The question right now is who is the FERC I have not met formally with the two new FERC commissioners since theyve been confirmed which just occurred last week I look forward to a transition period where the FERC gets off its ideology and gets back to practicality and doing its job as a regulator Will that happen as long as George Bush and Dick Cheney are saying quite the opposite California needs to do what it needs to do to protect itself but I do think we may have an opportunity in transition We cant count on it but we shouldnt close the door to it The new electricity plants coming on line for the most part are natural gasfired Would we still be in a crunch if natural gas prices remain high The PUC has been doing everything it possibly can in the last two months and will continue to do it in the next several months to encourage utilities to add natural gas infrastructure The other thing is they have to inject natural gas into storage right now even though we know that the price of natural gas is too high California is being gouged on natural gas Isnt everybody else being gouged on natural gas prices No God no Prices at the California border are two to three times higher than anyplace else in the country The problem here is the El Paso line is the market maker for the price of gas coming in to California because of anticompetitive behavior which I believe was intentional to raise prices That evidence is being heard at the FERC right now Are you expecting anything from that administrative law judge at FERC We have to be hopeful The astonishing thing here is that we California cannot count on the federal government

Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Monday May PM To Michael L Kirby Email Cc Molland Michael E Smith Amanda D Subject Draft Research Memorandum on Senator Dunn Issues Mike Here is the draft research memo that Amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding Senator Dunns investigation some of this you saw before Legislative Committee Subpoena Power Government Code Section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate Assembly or a committee may be issued by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Govt Code Section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the Senate Assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt Govt Code Section If the contempt is committed while the Legislature is in session Govt Code Section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or Assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or Assembly If the Legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled Govt Code Section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested It is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company Motion to Quash Subpoena California courts have held under CCP Section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum See eg People ex rel Dept of Public Works v Younger CalAppd My research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting Govt Code et seq Therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the Enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate Enron documents Here are the threshold questions A Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt Code Section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action B Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing subpoenas generally ie CCP et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie CCP et seq This is a tossup and the answer may well be both The Government Code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to CCP et seq subpoenas generally However the deposition subpoena provisions CCP et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the Senator seems to be undertaking Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to a California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents It is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from nonCalifornia Enron entities This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq Additional threshold question If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the State is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect Enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the case should be removable to federal court In People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Statutes Cal Bus Prof Code and The District Court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the State of California Id at Therefore for the purposes of the Unfair Competition Claims the Court found that the State of California was the real party in interest The Court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action Id Specifically the Court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant Eg Strawbridge v Curtiss US Cranch LEd Here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the State of California is not a citizen of any state Id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution The Eleventh Amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court It is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar Defendant relying on the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the United States because the State is the plaintiff However since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant Id internal citations removed However the Court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim Id If a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against Enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Generally in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the District Courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals the Ninth Circuit has said Our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution While it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see United States v Pacific A Ry Navigation Co US United States v Yellow Freight Sys th Cir Fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases We said in a related context We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States In general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney General In re Subpoena of Persico Fd d Cir quoting United States v Cox Fd th Cir Wisdom J concurring Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility See Case v Bowles US SCt LEd Nader v Saxbe USAppDC Fd n DCCir FTC v Guignon Fd th Cir But to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will United States v Morgan US SCt LEd United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd th Cir cert denied US SCt LEdd United States v General Dynamics Corp th Cir Fd The General Dynamics Court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses Id In another context the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the Attorney Generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the Act On the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry DDC FSupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected Therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against Enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act are relatively limited In addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the Federal Power Act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to the Power Commission FERCs predecessor Pennsylvania Water Power Co v Consolidated Gas Electric Light Power Co th Cir Fd I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments In other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by FERC would State law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded Further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive Also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the Federal Power Act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in

Government Code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to CCP et seq subpoenas generally However the deposition subpoena provisions CCP et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the Senator seems to be undertaking Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other

commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their

duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to a California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents It is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from nonCalifornia Enron entities This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq Additional threshold question If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the State is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect Enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the case should be removable to federal court In People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Statutes Cal Bus Prof Code and The District Court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the State of California Id at Therefore for the purposes of the Unfair Competition Claims the Court found that the State of California was the real party in interest The Court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action Id Specifically the Court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant Eg Strawbridge v Curtiss US Cranch LEd Here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the State of California is not a citizen of any state Id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution The Eleventh Amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court It is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar Defendant relying on the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the United States because the State is the plaintiff However since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant Id internal citations removed However the Court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim Id If a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against Enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Generally in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the District Courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals the Ninth Circuit has said Our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution While it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see United States v Pacific A Ry Navigation Co US United States v Yellow Freight Sys th Cir Fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases We said in a related context We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States In general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney General In re Subpoena of Persico Fd d Cir quoting United States v Cox Fd th Cir Wisdom J concurring Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility See Case v Bowles US SCt LEd Nader v Saxbe USAppDC Fd n DCCir FTC v Guignon Fd th Cir But to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will United States v Morgan US SCt LEd United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd th Cir cert denied US SCt LEdd United States v General Dynamics Corp th Cir Fd The General Dynamics Court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses Id In another context the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the Attorney Generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the Act On the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry DDC FSupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected Therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against Enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act are relatively limited In addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the Federal Power Act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to the Power Commission FERCs predecessor Pennsylvania Water Power Co v Consolidated Gas Electric Light Power Co th Cir Fd I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments In other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by FERC would State law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded Further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive Also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the Federal Power Act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in analogous situations This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential
