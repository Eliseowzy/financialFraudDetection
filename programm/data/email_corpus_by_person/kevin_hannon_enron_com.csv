Communications Subject Cornell Ken and Jeff As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their companys strategies for defining leadership in business today I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enrons recognition of Cornell as being a Core School in the MBA recruiting process The event as outlined below is scheduled for March th I appreciate your consideration Kevin Forwarded by Kevin HannonEnron Communications on AM AM To Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications cc Subject Kevin Just a quick followup on my November email regarding Enrons participation in the Johnson Schools March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken I know you have lots on you plate Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go Below is the earlier email I sent to you Thanks for the help Hope all is well with you Nov email text We at Cornells Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic unpredictable markets of the next decade One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two First we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson Schools Leadership Week in March As described in the attached materials Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty leadingedge corporations and students We very much would like Enron to present what we call a live case study at the corporate conference on underlineMarch underline You of course are an obvious candidate to do this Alternatively this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose President and COO of Corning Ken Chenault incoming CEO of American Express Marty Coyne just announced President of Kodaks new Commercial Group Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fastchanging marketplace We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week including Ken Blanchard and we think Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes but these are still long shots The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story this would be a good one If they cant do it hopefully we could convince you to do it Again the date is March The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines In fact if we started working on the teaching case soon it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron What kind of management philosophies systems and practices make this possible I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in and around As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way Kevin we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward As always thanks for your great personal support Dick

regarding Enrons participation in the Johnson Schools March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken I know you have lots on you plate Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go Below is the earlier email I sent to you Thanks for the help Hope all is well with you Nov email text We at Cornells Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic unpredictable markets of the next decade One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two First we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson Schools Leadership Week in March As described in the attached materials Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty leadingedge corporations and students We very much would like Enron to present what we call a live case study at the corporate conference on underlineMarch underline You of course are an obvious candidate to do this Alternatively this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose President and COO of Corning Ken Chenault incoming CEO of American Express Marty Coyne just announced President of Kodaks new Commercial Group Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fastchanging marketplace We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week including Ken Blanchard and we think Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes but these are still long shots The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story this would be a good one If they cant do it hopefully we could convince you to do it Again the date is March The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines In fact if we started working on the teaching case soon it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron What kind of management philosophies systems and practices make this possible I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in and around As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way Kevin we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward As always thanks for your great personal support Dick
