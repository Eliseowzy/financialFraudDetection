November AM To undisclosedrecipients Subject POWER POINTS Does Dynegy Know What Its Getting Into POWER POINTS Does Dynegy Know What Its Getting Into By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesIf I were an executive with Dynegy Inc DYN I would want to know who was buying up my stock Thursday and Friday encouraging me that Enron is a steal at a share After all the markets initial reaction to the DynegyEnron Corp ENE talks was negative Dynegys share price fell to on the Wednesday the day that Dynegy was negotiating a possible acquisition of Enron were disclosed by CNBC But Dynegys stock rebounded sharply Thursday to recover that loss and then some and its up another to near Friday Is this a case of average investors approving Dynegys steal of formerly formidable Enron Or were Wall Street banks holding a lot of Enron debt trying to encourage Dynegy to do a deal About of the million Dynegy shares bought Thursday were purchased in a few hundred large blocks Some usually talkative Wall Street bank sources refuse to say a word about Enron or Dynegy even off the record Wall Street may be biting its collective lip in the hopes that Dynegy signs the contracts to buy Enron and brings in a critical injection of cash That cash would come from ChevronTexaco Corp CVX which owns about a quarter of Dynegy According to the Wall Street Journal the terms of the deal call for ChevronTexaco to inject billion immediately and another billion into the combined companies if the deal goes through Wall Street holds billions in Enron debt which Dynegy is fully aware of But Dynegy might be getting more than its bargaining for particularly regarding Enrons numerous obligations to deliver its own shares in the future at minimum values SEC Probe Complicates Deals Based On Stock Any company that acquires Enron may have to make good on those commitments to issue stock pegged to values much higher than a share or perhaps to make up the difference in cash In a publicly disclosed example an Enron offbalancesheet financial affiliate Whitewing Associates owns shares of Enron convertible preferred stock which are good upon conversion in January for million shares of Enron common stock at a guaranteed minimum value of a share Enrons stock is currently trading below a share According to the terms of Whitewings convertible preferred holding Enron would have to deliver far more shares at current prices for each of the convertibles But Enron cant issue new stock now because its under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission so it would be obliged to come up with the pershare difference in cash Since Enron owns of Whitewing it could tear up most of the convertibles but not all of them A rough estimate is that Enron or Dynegy would still owe the dozens of mutual funds that invested in Whitewing around million cash Dynegy is surely familiar with that deal but highly leveraged Enron has similar sharesettled arrangements floating around that havent been so fully disclosed The lesserknown deals are similarly troublesome due to the combination of Enrons stockprice crash and its inability to issue lots of new stock to make up the difference Another Enronrelated partnership the Marlin Water Trust II is part of Enrons disastrous venture into water companies through its Azurix affiliate and the later refinancing of huge losses related to the water investments Enron has marked down the value of its direct holdings in Azurix but not the assets of Marlin even though Marlins primary asset is supposed to be its half of Azurix Prominent Enron shortseller Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management has asked Enron why Marlins assets are still valued at billion when of Azurix would seem to be a worth a fraction of that amount Enron has declined to answer Grubmans question fully Is Wall Street Short Fitch credit rating agency said this July that Marlins debt is ultimately supported by an equity commitment from Enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock Neither the number of shares nor the guaranteed minimum value for those shares has been disclosed If Enron cant deliver those shares it is obliged to make up the difference in cash Fitch said In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes Enron is required to deliver additional shares Fitch said If Enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron representing a general unsecured claim In another partnership disclosed in Enrons annual report but not named Enron invested the right to receive up to million shares of outstanding Enron common stock in March subject to certain conditions Do those conditions include a share value much higher than Did Enron prudently purchase puts on its own stock from Wall Street to cover some of its positions As part of that same deal Enron paid million to purchase unspecified options on million shares of its common stock Because these deals are done through private placements of debt Enron doesnt have to answer questions and it has declined to do so Dynegy also refused to answer questions on the issue One Wall Street equity derivatives trading manager indicated that all the banks have found themselves unexpectedly short inthemoney puts on Enron Unexpectedly perhaps not just because Enron stock has fallen so far but because the SEC investigation prevents Enron from issuing additional shares Wall Street has been sweating for weeks and millions dont make Wall Street sweat Billions do and the concern has to do with liabilities beyond Enrons fully disclosed traditional debt The banks have told Enron they dont expect to get clobbered on a technicality that wouldnt have arisen without the SEC investigation Enron brought on itself a person at a bank involved in the talks said Enron agreed in principle but the negotiations to make Wall Street whole were put on hold for the Dynegy talks If Dynegy buys Enron it may be stepping into the middle of those arrangements letting Wall Street off the hook Dynegy competitor El Paso Corp EPG and ChevronTexaco rival Royal DutchShell RD reportedly took a look at acquiring Enron last week and passed Is Dynegy smarter than El Paso Is Chevron smarter than Shell True Dynegy believers better hope so

about a possible structure It is because the new FERC cap is making it difficult to figure out how a project like this is going to operate A few thoughts I CDWR Dispatch Issues It remains unclear to me how the communication with GWFCDWR will work each day What time will we get an indication of the volume they want If the communication occurs late it will be difficult to obtain much value from the capacity they do not need Even if the communication occurs late with the current cap there is little value in the extra MWs at your heat rate given the current FERC cap and gas prices Given that there could be very little value on the extra MWs we would ask for a monthly fee in the neighborhood of to schedule the CDWR volumes To fine tune this number we need to clarify a few things Will we be invoicing CDWR What is the scheduling timing What is the Enron liability for failure to submit the schedule Do you want us to submit supplemental bids for your extra capacity on your behalf to abide by the FERC order What happens if you are dispatched at a loss when we forget to put in Supplemental Energy Bids Gas Pricing Here is a summary of possible gas pricing for you GWF pays demand charge equal to Maximum Daily Quantity MDQ times MMBtu GWF schedules gas each day with the Enron up to the MDQ The Daily Contract Quantity DCQ is the amount GWF schedules each day Quantities above the DCQ can be made available on a mutually acceptable basis GWF pays variable charge equal to DCQ times Gas Daily MidPoint for PGE City gate plus MMBtu GWF can substititue for the Gas Daily price with a NGI PGE City Gate Price or a Fixed Price upon mutual agreement GWF responsible for any imbalance charges resulting from using a volume different than the DCQ Enron responsible for imbalance charges when they deliver a quantity other than the DCQ The Monthly Consumption Quantity MCQ is the sum of daily usage If GWF does not want to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool GWF will be responsible for managing imbalances between the DCQ and actual usage If GWF wants to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool differences between the MCQ and the sum of the DCQs shall be cashed out as follows provided Imbalance Charges are not incurred EPMI will purchase the volume by which the sum of the DCQs exceeds the MCQ at the average of the highest days Gas Daily MidPoint and sell the volume by which the sum of the DCQs is less than the MCQ at the average of the lowest days Gas Daily Mid Point If Imbalance Charges are incurred then either or would apply In conclusion I recognize that you might think kMonth is steep However Scheduling Coordination is labor intensive and risky particularly with the FERC cap and the political quagmire That said I definitely think we can help you guys optimize your generation but At a minimum we can buy your energy from time to time We can also set you up with Enron Online for no cost providing the most transparent price information available in the industry today For these reasons I want to get Master Agreements in place The first step in this process is for you to provide financial statements Can you send those to me Something that might work for you guys is to use the APX to be your SC This will require more work on your part but it is a low cost option Another thing is to watch out for firms offering low prices for SC services without giving you a clear indication of what they will pay you for your extra MWs They will make their somewhereDo not limit yourself to one counterparty IN this age you need multiple trading

the talking points we have prepared for what we are looking for with an SCGas SupplierEnergy Marketer We are in the process of establishing a confidentiality release with California Department Of Water Resources CDWR so we can share aspects of our contracts with Enron Until then I can only be vague But in a nut shell we are in the process of installing LM in the Hanford California area that will be operational Phase I Phase II is also in the Hanford area again LM s Phase III is located near Tracy California and this will consist of GE EAs Initially all of these units are simple cycle There is an option for Phase III to be converted to a combined cycle unit The combined MW capacity of the simple cycle is MW If we close the loop at Tracy this will increase by approximately MWs CDWR has dispatch rights of so many hours per year and they have first pick In a rough cut assume we will have about a year in hours for the first three phases that could be in the market The option we are exploring is can we establish a winwin relation ship with a company like Enron that would supply our gas needs be able to schedule our power both for CDWR and our own account and be able to market our power outside of CDWRs requirements Potentially a incentive feetiered structure would be workable We are open to ideas Based on our initial conversation it sounded like you may be interested We would like to get together to discuss our options with you As I said in my voice mail I will be out of the office until next Thursday Thursday afternoon or Friday or would work for us to have this first
