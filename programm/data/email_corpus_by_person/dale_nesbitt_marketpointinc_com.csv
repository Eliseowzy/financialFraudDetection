<22742536.1075856311669.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dale.nesbitt@marketpointinc.com,2000-07-12 17:03:00,Thoughts on Last Fridays BreakfastThanks for breakfast last Friday I have been reflecting on a couple of your thoughts and very much want to take the steps forward you suggested Let me take a shot at articulating what we said to make sure I have it right and let me take a shot at making comments and suggestions Firstly thanks for agreeing to bring MarketPoint to the attention of your outside equity people once again I understand that you are a go between and I recognize and appreciate whatever efforts you are able to make I also recognize as you admonished that there are no guarantees here and that you can only do your best Thank you for that no matter what the outcome Secondly your suggestion that our short term gas and electric models shoul d be click throughs my words intended to reflect the sentiment you expressed on the enrononlinecom website are absolutely consistent with th e MarketPoint business concept and right up our alley I unequivocally want to move forward with that All that remains for MarketPoint to do so is to secure the venture capitalization to create the website delivery system to accommodate such click through and browser access We have the hard part done the enabling technology and we only lack the internet delivery system That should take a few months time after we secure the capitalization we need However in the meantime we would be prepared to put Excel spreadsheets with our scenarios in a web location where they can be clicked through from enrononlinecom and that could be done a bit soone r if you and your enrononlinecom people might be interested in providing the capitalization We already offer our North American electric plant data base on a click though basis through eacumencom so that part of our infrastructure is already available or imminent I believe they are goin g commercial with our data product any time now Please let me know how we can consummate an agreement here Thirdly I am surmising there might be a lot of value to Enron from applyin g and demonstrating MarketPoint in the more nascent areas of your business where there are clearly few or no credible comprehensive preexisting proprietary fundamental modeling tools eg metals telecommunications MIPS agricultural commodities water I would jump at the chance to work under your sponsorship to build an inherently new previously nonexistent forward market model of a commodity such as copper silver gold phosphate aluminum potash grain or some other commodity you want to attack That would give you an objective kick at the can unfettered by the fact that there are previously existing models you might want to compare against each other or against your own or that you have ongoing internal capabilities in those areas You have the prospect to get immediate value from such a mode l in your embryonic metal or other trading business and to evaluate MarketPoint people and MarketPoint technology in a real life setting I should mention that I have a relationship with what I consider to be the premier miningmineral processing group in the world Michigan Technologica l University Working with their metalsmineral processing professors we could build a world scope forward copper gold silver aluminum or simila r model in several weeks time that considers every facility in every supply chain in the world Most metals have no more than several tens or a few hundreds of facilities in the world total and those facilities are well known and accessible over the Internet or from trade associations or the government Our United States Geological Survey contacts should be very useful here I really respect the Michigan Tech people I know They know the metal supply chains all the way from the geology and resource considerations at the extreme upstream end the existing and prospective ways to mine and process that resource into such intermediate goods as pregnant leach solution copper sulfide concentrate gold cyanate blister copper solvent extractionelectrowinning intermediate product and ultimately into final goods such as tubing sheeting wires and other fina l forms I would be prepared to send you a brief proposal and consulting contract to undertake such an effort and I am confident I can get Michigan Tech to subcontract the data and domain expertise at modest cost They hav e strong incentives to do something like this for it connects them even more closely to the industry they covet If you access the Michigan Tech website you will see a Dr Carl Nesbitt my brother there as a mining and minerals processor person He has recognized world class skills in that field and is an Altos associate as well as a tenured Michigan Tech professor Fourthly I agree with your sentiment that Enron has been quite success ful with what we have been doing and that We lean toward our own techno logy I have the utmost respect and admiration for Enron and the technology and thinking you have operationalized in the past Notwithstanding that comment I am sure Enron would not consider writing your own spreadsheet code to replace Excel or writing your own C compiler to replace Microsoft s or writing your own LP code to avoid purchasing one commercially There is simply no economic impetus to redo what comes from the commercial market better and cheaperEnron buys rather than builds technology that augments your productivity as you should as long as it does not compromise confidentiality or competitive advantage Vince MarketPoint is technology that augments Enrons productivity and allows you to do what you want to do in the fundamental modeling area rapidly and accurately MarketPoint does not substitute for or devalue your internally developed technology it augments and extends your people data and fundamental market insight MarketPoint already has over man years of cumulative development effort embedded within it and it is just now becoming a custom tinkertoy set approach that Enron can use to enhance your productivity and accelerate wha t you want to do in the fundamental modeling arena Like Excel it has passe d the market test for almost twenty years across the entire industry including Enron itself There are people in Enron today who I believe hold MarketPointNARG in high esteem in part because they are aware of its formidable and notable success over the past many years I hope you and your people can come to view MarketPoint in that wayan automated productivity tool that can help Enron build and monitize proprietary conten t faster cheaper and more accurately than you otherwise might and than your competitors can MarketPoint might save you a lot of time and money and i t might allow you to redirect your resources toward even more productivity an d profitability just as Excel and Microsoft C have done With the advent of ecommerce your business is ultimately more up for grabs than i t once was I must say I admire your early success and your early strong lead However barriers to ecommerce entry are smaller than barriers to traditional business entry and branding is harder to hold You need to continue and in fact accelerate the first mover advantage and branding yo u have so successfully built in the past decade and a half and I believe tha t top quality high barriertoentry rapid deployment technologies such as MarketPoint might help you do so I would even go one step further In th e coming ecommerce era technology such as MarketPoint will play even more o f a role and labor centric activities will be risky and statistically less successful We are pleased MarketPoint is emerging at the start of todays intervertical competition era because we believe all the winners such as Enron will ultimately need to use it if they are to be successful Increasingly the not invented here approach is likely to be supplanted with the cobble together elements of technology to make metatechnology because first mover advantage and branding will accelerate in value MarketPoint enabling technology is perfect for that Fifthly I should mention that if any people in your traditional gas and electric and other businesses want to use MarketPoint or Altos please feel free to contact me with the opportunity We are eager to serve their or your immediate business needs as they encounter them in our traditional consulting mode That was the point of the earlier meeting Kim Watson organized and that objective hopefully has not fallen by the wayside durin g our private discussions After you have had a couple of days to think about the foregoing five points lets talk I think if you get the chance to work with me and MarketPoint you will see that we are what we aspire to bethe Enron of the fundamental forward pricing worldthe best in class A partnershi p between two bests in class certainly makes sense I know you have no basis to believe that MarketPoint is best in classit is new and you and I have not worked together in close proximity I am eager to provide you a low cost high value opportunity to determine whether that might be true Let s communicate by email or by phone in a week or ten days and see if we might get something going Dale Nesbitt

respect and admiration for Enron and the technology and thinking you have operationalized in the past Notwithstanding that comment I am sure Enron would not consider writing your own spreadsheet code to replace Excel or writing your own C compiler to replace Microsoft s or writing your own LP code to avoid purchasing one commercially There is simply no economic impetus to redo what comes from the commercial market better and cheaperEnron buys rather than builds technology that augments your productivity as you should as long as it does not compromise confidentiality or competitive advantage Vince MarketPoint is technology that augments Enrons productivity and allows you to do what you want to do in the fundamental modeling area rapidly and accurately MarketPoint does not substitute for or devalue your internally developed technology it augments and extends your people data and fundamental market insight MarketPoint already has over man years of cumulative development effort embedded within it and it is just now becoming a custom tinkertoy set approach that Enron can use to enhance your productivity and accelerate wha t you want to do in the fundamental modeling arena Like Excel it has passe d the market test for almost twenty years across the entire industry including Enron itself There are people in Enron today who I believe hold MarketPointNARG in high esteem in part because they are aware of its formidable and notable success over the past many years I hope you and your people can come to view MarketPoint in that wayan automated productivity tool that can help Enron build and monitize proprietary conten t faster cheaper and more accurately than you otherwise might and than your competitors can MarketPoint might save you a lot of time and money and i t might allow you to redirect your resources toward even more productivity an d profitability just as Excel and Microsoft C have done With the advent of ecommerce your business is ultimately more up for grabs than i t once was I must say I admire your early success and your early strong lead However barriers to ecommerce entry are smaller than barriers to traditional business entry and branding is harder to hold You need to continue and in fact accelerate the first mover advantage and branding yo u have so successfully built in the past decade and a half and I believe tha t top quality high barriertoentry rapid deployment technologies such as MarketPoint might help you do so I would even go one step further In th e coming ecommerce era technology such as MarketPoint will play even more o f a role and labor centric activities will be risky and statistically less successful We are pleased MarketPoint is emerging at the start of todays intervertical competition era because we believe all the winners such as Enron will ultimately need to use it if they are to be successful Increasingly the not invented here approach is likely to be supplanted with the cobble together elements of technology to make metatechnology because first mover advantage and branding will accelerate in value MarketPoint enabling technology is perfect for that Fifthly I should mention that if any people in your traditional gas and electric and other businesses want to use MarketPoint or Altos please feel free to contact me with the opportunity We are eager to serve their or your immediate business needs as they encounter them in our traditional consulting mode That was the point of the earlier meeting Kim Watson organized and that objective hopefully has not fallen by the wayside durin g our private discussions After you have had a couple of days to think about the foregoing five points lets talk I think if you get the chance to work with me and MarketPoint you will see that we are what we aspire to bethe Enron of the fundamental forward pricing worldthe best in class A partnershi p between two bests in class certainly makes sense I know you have no basis to believe that MarketPoint is best in classit is new and you and I have not worked together in close proximity I am eager to provide you a low cost high value opportunity to determine whether that might be true Let s communicate by email or by phone in a week or ten days and see if we might get something going Dale Nesbitt
