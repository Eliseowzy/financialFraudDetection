<22381387.1075852936877.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,barkerde@nmenergy.com,2001-07-30 08:23:27,Something to writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Having worked the same shift schedule that the ISO uses I have something new to ponder Assuming Senior Shift Operator A was on day shift MonTues and SSO B was on day shift for WedThurs The results of the Real Time prices uplift were dramatically different from SSO A to SSO B Mon and Tues were very similar and Wed very different If all things being nearly the same could the operating philosophies of the two SSOs contributed to a very divergent economic results When the ISO does its post mortem bad choice of words on the high load days do they look at the operating philosophies of the operators to see if they impact economics When I say philosophies I am NOT referring to the security decisions only on how the solving of the security constraints could be different enough to have two totally different economic impacts Further back pedaling without knowing the outages or Bid stacks etc I am only asking if the ISO looks at this kind of thing when they do their evaluation Ponder away
