<25107858.1075840064555.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sean.crandall@enron.com,2001-07-10 16:45:13,RE Request for clarificatiobn of FERC order Cc comments I wouldnt agree the caps have hurt liquidity In fact in the Northwe st at least they have actually increased liquidity Any decrease in liqui dity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things uncertainty abou t the level of the cap and when the dayahead prices trade above the ca p removing marketers as sellers I would propose the following cap timelines First of all I think its im portant that FERC realize the spot market really is two separate markets what we call the dayahead cash markets and dayof realtime markets The hour designation doesnt dovetail with the current market timeline s and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and disp atch of power plants For example dayahead cash typically trades from am to approximately am for next day deliveries However on Thursd ays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries and on F ridays we trade for Sunday and Monday all of this can be adjusted for var ious reasons but this is the typical schedule If we held to the hour spot cap literally then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the da yahead market but would not apply to Saturday and Monday This obviously cannot be an intended consequence I recommend the cap timeline be consis tent with the dayahead WSCC OTC trading timelines In addition there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the dayahead market What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that realtime markets will be trading above the thr eshold Assume that stage I II or even III is a certainty It seems prud ent that a higher dayahead price cap be established still consistent with FERCs guidelines Why Because you would want units prescheduled to ha ve high reserve margins going into realtime rather than scrambling to dis patch units realtime It seems like it would be prudent for some independ ent board to set the dayahead price cap equal to either the or Stage I limit prior to trading time This board would have to have regional repre sentatives in order to be truly effective Establishing the cap does not h ave to be cumbersome or time consuming in fact it should be fairly easy The cap governing realtime transactions is clear However what isnt cle ar is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the exis ting of stage I cap For example during the first couple of days in J uly the realtime cap was operating under the of Stage criteria appr oximately The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually f ell to the s This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldnt happen As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwe st for a few hours across the peak It seems odd that prices should fall r ealtime as reserve margins decrease One could argue this is a good reaso n why caps should be tied to daily gas prices but assuming that isnt an o ption I propose something like this The DAY BEFORE around the CAI SO or preferably an independent body would determine the realtime nonSt age cap as well as a Stage minimum While in a stage I II or III the hou rly price would be the HIGHER of the nonstage price cap OR the recalculate d Stage price If the Stage I price turned out lower then the nonstage p rice would be used for that hour but the recalculated Stage I cap and cor responding price would apply for the NEXT operating day and for daya head cash trading for the next trade day This provides information before the trading period enhancing liquidity and eliminates strange price move ments during realtime It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm Marketer prices I think there is a clear bias against marketers in th e order But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketer s there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recov er costs that are easily demonstrable First would be losses at a tie into California If we sell at the cap and incurr losses then we cant sell a t the cap Second would be the credit premium Credit issues apply wh ether youre a marketer or generator Third would be call options It see ms if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option that a party should be able to exercise and sell Im not sure what the difference between a peaking plant and a call option is Original Message From Comnes Alan SentMonday July PM ToYoder Christian Hall Steve

Thursday May AM To outhstreamcom mailto outhstreamcom mailto mailto mailto mailto mailto mailto mailto Subject spoke too soon Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes quickly at meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and had i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends ensuring his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge now dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but stare into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives A member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp this morning Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i think of this mountain now i think only of death Russ is quite experienced in higaltitude rescues but this is the first time he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly strong Many stories of heroism over last hours and many to come The guide and the client spent the night on the ridge meters incoherent and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second time in hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes reaching top camp metersstill incredibly dangerous at pm It was a relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen moving space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could not stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above meters are epics and you are sure to read about this Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available bodies and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba and Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace and the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is inches across for stretches dropping feet on either side When i gazed down nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there for over hours now have been gathering oxygen for the meter descent to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a doublerescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back by mem daywe have to get these people down The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower and slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh oh Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a burning building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is literally cut in half I am praying for these twoand the russiansand its hard to think f anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have messages from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its really sad I am sure they are also severely dehydratedill explain the process when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp was when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razorthin this whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a tenyearold knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here is that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line we used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the mountain And its so hard to do that Is a quarter tank enough Half Or do you need even more because in truth you are dying from the moment you leave camp not even top camp I will pass this info only when the word is outsorrybut will keep you updated from there once i talk ro russ Its hard watching friends die but were helpless down here

it was Basically I am certain I will make a minimum of Kyear with either company worst case Im looking at Kyear excluding incentive Incentive would be in addition to My offer would have to be in that ballpark If I worked the year assuming a base salary in the to range I would get less Also Im not trying to be vague Essentially Im working with moving partsnon of which has become crystal clear yet At this point lets look at this year contract with an out after year base salary signing bonus retention bonus after year If I take it Im done for another year Participation in the incentive package

a pain but I have a simple style when it comes to hiring I just need to know exactly how everything fits together If you do not wish to reveal that it your choice I tried to get the best package put together so there is not a lot of games Im not sure we can match those numbers and ultimately Tim McCabe will have to make that call but it helps if its a clear as possible It sounds like you have a lot of great opportunities We are having meeting today to discuss the trading situation I will keep you posted Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday May AM To Subject RE Hey Bruce The and are guaranteed yes I didnt mean to imply Cinergy wouldnt pay out I meant more im basically comparing startup prospects with established companyoperations prospects Startup prospects are I think more risky

Bruce ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESSukalyCBruceCbruceEsukalycinergyEc omE NRONcom Sent Wednesday May PM To Crandall Sean Subject RE Thanks for the update I will forward this information I assume that the low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the company you will receive the min amount Is that true As far as Cinergy having a payout record it does The bonus plan pays out of profits I dont think there is any other company paying that kind of money They paid on it last year However the PL has to be there but the money was distributed Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesnt enter into performance I think that is unique as well As far as Houston goes I can show you parts of the city that are beautiful and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous value Im minutes from every venue sport education theatre musuems in the fourth largest city in America In addition your family will not be trapped to one employer I lived in a few places and visited numerous others I think its the best value city in the country In addition with the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas And being in the energy trading business it has no peer Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday May PM To Subject RE Down to brass tacks eh This is always the interesting part Quite frankly Bruce its a pretty good job market Basically Im looking at two other prospects The first will require me to sign a year contract the second will not The base component with the first is going to be around year The second is going to be around year As far as incentive bonus goes Im looking at about a minimum of for the first to about a max of At the second Im looking at a min of about to about a max of So over a one year period were looking at about to M for prospect and To M for prospect In terms of location both prospect and are in attractive locations for me Prospect is in a VERY attractive location To be honest Im not a big buyer of Houston so I have to factor that into the equation Secondly both prospects are big well entrenched players so Im pretty confident of the above numbers While Im pretty excited about the prospects of being on the ground floor with Cinergy I also have to recognize Cinergy doesnt have a PL track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout For that reason I think I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year while still participating in Cinergys incentive program The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company Given what you guys have in mind I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly and with less risk I also think there is serious money to be made with the right teamIve seen it happen at Enron No matter what happens I appreciate you taking the time

named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsibl e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t he proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward Th e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho uld be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and pr oducing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments wil l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some area s we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR proce ss must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea d named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington

submit exp ert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be th e Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif ornia ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t o cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proc eeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr ent price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps i n an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaki ng season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will b e starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc ourage power
