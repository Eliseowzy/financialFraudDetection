Eric Subject FW Non US Locations Importance High Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject FW Non US Locations A few more details Again most of the EGA companies ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities Through further research we found a few more that dont totally fit that mold Elektro Electricidad e Servicos SA in Brazil of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities EPE Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris SC Ltda aka Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a direct ownership interest and one Board vote Energia Ltd another Brazil operation is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of Feb Again this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know Original Message From Davis Hardie Sent Wednesday December AM To Kean Steven J Subject RE Non US Locations Steve As stated earlier many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership We can assure you that for the most part you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ie Corp ENA EES etc There are a few however that may be incorrectly categorized as follows EA ECT Non US Payroll Company there is no such entity but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA Enron Capital Trade Resources in London UK may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited EBS Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd actually comes up to Corp through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance EEOS Enron Engineering Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe EES Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities ServicesLimbach companies EGA Heres where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with complicated multilayers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp ownership As you know all of the old subsets ie APACHI CALME etc have gone away and everything international is now EGA To the best of our knowledge all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed Following are the exceptions andor unusual organizational structure that should be noted Electricidad Enron de Guatemala SA actually reports up through ENA San Juan Gas Company Inc in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp owned Enron American del Sur SA is an Enron CorpEnron Transportation Services entity No entity called Enron Singapore more than likely Enron Capital Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company EIM No Stadacona Paper Company but it is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp as the general partner and a list of Limited Partners including ENA Enron Corp and a nonEnron entity Salomon Brothers Holding Company Inc ENW Enron Net Works LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp company EWC The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp which is owned by Smith Street Land Co an Enron Corp company but many of the names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas SA no Enron Wind UK no Enron Wind India but regardless they are all part of the EWCEREC family GLOBAL These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration Production Inc which is owned by Enron Corp but one has indirect outside ownership EP Enron Oil Gas India Ltd for instance is owned by Enron Asst Holdings which is owned by Enron Finance Partners which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one nonEnron entity Zephyrus Investments LLC with a small interest Again I hope this information is helpful For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance Hardie Angus H Davis Vice President Corporate Secretary Department
