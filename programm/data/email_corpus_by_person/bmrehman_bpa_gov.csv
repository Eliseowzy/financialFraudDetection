Miller Sharon R mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To Subject RE ESC Conference Call to discuss Business Practices I have to caution against copying the SCP or the closely related Order into the OASIS Phase business practices They should merely be reviewed to avoid missing anything Copying in parts of Order have already created direct conflict between some of the business practices Its important to remember that the SCP is the solution to business needs that existed years ago and that were a much smaller subset of the business needs of OASIS Phase Slapping an old solution onto a new problem is rarely if ever advisable There is a lot of technical implementation detail in Order that should be avoided in the new business practices Instead the BPs should focus on WHAT business requirements The HOW design implementation should be covered by the new SCP For instance instead of covering the specific state change of COUNTEROFFER cover the general business processes of negotiation Nothing in the BPs even says that negotiation can occur much less what can be negotiated Is it just price or is it capacity and time as well or is it something else Id suggest you start by defining what the transmission products are The existing definitions dont fit some of the BPs Then cover the processes for obtaining them For instance Buyers submit requests for what and to whom source to sink submitted to many sellers all at once or partial path to one seller at a time What data is required or optional Can they agree in advance to accept the current posted price Can they agree in advance to accept whatever capacity is available Sellers do what with the request negotiate terms approve request reject request according to what rules etc Buyers do what during negotiation process accept terms suggest other terms match another buyers bid reject the terms etc Buyers do what with their transmission right use them as they are dont use them use them on a different path sell part or all of them to someone else reassign part or all of them to someone else defer them to a later time period extend them beyond their original time period etc If these types of what questions are answered thoroughly then the OSC will be able to define the right architecture communication structure state transitions etc to meet the business needs Sharon Miller IBM representing Xcel Energy Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday January AM To Cc Subject Re ESC Conference Call to discuss Business Practices Patt I think many of your questions about Business Practice could be resolved by including the definitions and state diagram from the OASIS SCP Order I pulled out a copy of the definitions but could not grab the diagram from the pdf file so I attached the entire document The definitions appear on pages and the state diagram is on page I also threw out my responses for whatever they are worth to your questions in the body of your email Mike Although the wording for these standards in BP is taken directly out of Order in looking at the State Diagram it appears to me that SUPERSEDED should be included in Standards and and that DECLINED and SUPERSEDED should be included in Standard VI Is there a reason that we are trying to make this our standalone document instead of just endorsing the Standards as they appear in Order taking exception or recommending changes where necessary Using Patts email as an example it seems like we are taking a big risk of missing something if we just take bits and pieces of a document John Calder Dominion Virginia Power See attached file OASISSCPrmfinalpdf The possible STATUS values are QUEUED initial status assigned by TSIP on receipt of customer services purchase request INVALID assigned by TSIP or Provider indicating an invalid field in the request such as improper POR POD source sink etc Final state RECEIVED assigned by Provider or Seller to acknowledge QUEUED requests and indicate the service request is being evaluated including for completing the required ancillary services STUDY assigned by Provider or Seller to indicate some level of study is required or being performed to evaluate service request REFUSED assigned by Provider or Seller to indicate service request has been denied due to availability of transmission capability SELLERCOMMENTS should be used to communicate details for denial of service Final state COUNTEROFFER assigned by Provider or Seller to indicate that a new OFFERPRICE is being proposed or that CAPACITYGRANTED is less than CAPACITYREQUESTED REBID assigned by Customer to indicate that a new BIDPRICE is being proposed SUPERSEDED assigned by Provider or Seller when a request which has not yet been confirmed is displaced by another reservation request Final state ACCEPTED assigned by Provider or Seller to indicate the service request at the designated OFFERPRICE and CAPACITYGRANTED has been approvedaccepted If the reservation request was submitted PRECONFIRMED and CAPACITYGRANTED is equal to CAPACITYREQUESTED the OASIS Node shall immediately set the reservation status to CONFIRMED Depending upon the type of ancillary services required the Seller may or may not require all ancillary service reservations to be completed before accepting a request DECLINED assigned by Provider or Seller to indicate that the terms and conditions such as the BIDPRICE are unacceptable and that negotiations are terminated SELLERCOMMENTS should be used to communicate reason for denial of service Final state CONFIRMED assigned by Customer in response to Provider or Seller posting ACCEPTED status to confirm service Once a request has been CONFIRMED a transmission service reservation exists Final state unless overridden by DISPLACED or ANNULLED state WITHDRAWN assigned by Customer at any point in request evaluation to withdraw the request from any further action Final state DISPLACED assigned by Provider or Seller when a CONFIRMED reservation from a Customer is displaced by a longer term reservation and the Customer has exercised right of first refusal ie refused to match terms of new request Final state ANNULLED assigned by Provider or Seller when by mutual agreement with the Customer a confirmed reservation is to be voided Final state RETRACTED assigned by Provider or Seller when the Customer fails to confirm or withdraw the request within the required time period Final state Forwarded by John CalderESVANCPOWER on wrte amcom To Mike McElhany Sent by cc owner e Subject Re ESC Conference Call to discuss Business Practices rccom Mike I wont be able to join the conference call on the st due to being on night shift I have a couple of questions on BP and Regarding Business Practice I dont see where theres an option to PreConfirm a transmission request Are we still going to have this option Does it need to be specifically addressed I would think yes Is this supposed to be implied in Standard The customer doesnt actually change the status to CONFIRMED but maybe its just semantics as in if there computer is doing the CONFIRM behind the scenes and not actually changing the status manually Preconfirmed is not mentioned because it does not effect the timing requirements When the tag is submitted it is QUEUED and then must be acted on by the TP within the specified time frame All preconfirmed does is remove the obligation of the PSE to respond after the TP ACCEPTS the request since preconfirmed automatically takes it to CONFIRMED In Standard there is a state of INVALID But this is never described and there doesnt seem to be any further reference to it Should we describe what would be designated as INVALID What is supposed to happen when the request is in this state Should there be a statement included such as if a request is found to be INVALID the only way to have further consideration given to the request is by submitting a new valid request Per the definition INVALID is a Final State for the Request What is the distinction between DECLINED and REFUSED Should this distinction be included in this document Is DECLINED a refusal of a REBID as implied in Standard See Definitions Refused is for lack of ATC Declined says TP does not accept your terms Depending on the answer to shouldnt Standard include DECLINED In addition to ACCEPTED COUNTEROFFER and REFUSED No The TP can DECLINE a request because the price is incorrect whether or not there is ATC available In Standard it talks about RECEIVED But RECEIVED isnt mentioned anywhere else How does the request get to the RECEIVED state And what happens to it from there And how is it different from QUEUED RECEIVED is a placeholder state that simply means the TP has received the request The paths from Queued and Received are identical Standard says that the TP can move the request to RETRACTED Shouldnt this be included in Standard RETRACTED should not be included in because you cannot go from QUEUED to RETRACTED Again depending on the answer to should REFUSED be included in Standard In addition to DECLINED ACCEPTED and COUNTEROFFER Again the answer is NO because you cannot go from REBID to REFUSED HOWEVER SUPERSEDED should be included in this list Regarding Business Practice Under Detailed Practice Reassignment Im not sure that I understand the distinction between all rights and rollover rights Or wouldnt all rights include rollover rights It states in the first paragraph that by default rollover rights remain with the original rights owner This seems to contradict the rest of the paragraph which states that the original transmission purchaser is removed from all obligations and that all rights transfer to the secondary purchaser Wouldnt that include the rollover rights Should the statements say with all rights and obligations with the possible exception of rollover rights transferring to the secondary transmission rights owner The first paragraph states that rollover rights can be transferred by explicit contractual determination How would this be conveyed to the TSP Will the manner of communication be standardized such as including it in the notification of reassignment of transmission rights Thanks
