Players As we head down the home stretch identifying those players movi ng up or down can be the difference betweendominating the playoffs or watchi ng from the sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these player s its inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or downg rade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players th at are moving In other words a player like TE Ricky Dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Like wise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he s still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Aaron Brooks NO We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up yards and TDs as h e went for The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it appea rs Brooks will continue to air the ball out Yes hell make some young QB mistakes and Id be surprised if he didnt throw as many interceptions as he does TDs I expect him to throw a lot of both I almost started him over Peyton Manning in my local league but didnt pull the trigger Manning wa s solid but Brooks was better QB Kordell Stewart Pit Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here he sits again It took a few years but hes showing folks that maybe was no fluke He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked out with a bad knee or calf depending on whether you listen to coach Bill Cowher or Stewart The TD rush was highlight material His problem all along seems to have been confidence and hes surely brimming with it now Kent Graham was so bad I wont even mention him in the downgrades but he p ut on a horrid display when he was in the game Hes awful QB Jay Fiedler Mia Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks ago that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler was as pretty as anything Dan Marino ever threw Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair ly often against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going to have an advantage in their cold weather Didnt play out that way Fiedler looks pretty darn good QB Jeff Garcia SF We had him high in week like we have all year and he didnt disappoint WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently Jerry Rices wifeharping on the radio had some sort of positive effect The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded them QB Brett Favre GB I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu y just does what it takes to get the job done Hed be much better off if W R Antonio Freeman earned of his paycheck but in the meantime Bill Schroeders doing a great job QB Jeff George Was Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to keeping his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday George looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year Although tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch Im a Jeff George fan though and he does give the team a big arm Well see how it goes but at least it looks as if hell get his shot RBs Moving Up RB Mike Anderson Den Like you need me to tell you this The fact that he ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the more impressive He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to be good for Sunday Clearly the Denver OL is the star on this team so if you own Anderson its probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t he stretch run RB Fred Taylor Jac For all the earlyripping Ive done to Taylor hes performed just as we predicted he would lately like a madman You dont need me to tell you hes been awesome RB Warrick Dunn TB Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike Alstott Ive got a couple hundred reasons that says yes Ok rushing for against Dallas is nothing special its happened in of the Cowboys games this year but you have to admit Dunn looked great Sunday RB Corey Dillon Cin One can only salivate about what he might do if he played for a team like Denver The fact he can continue to roll up huge yardage on this team is amazing New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as he looks like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili Smith RB Ahman Green GB Greens a guy thats finally living up to his potential You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to be catching up mentally as well He showed a nice nose for the endzone Sunday with the TDs RB Lamar Smith Mia So much for the cold weather hamstring worries Smith carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great It look s to me like hes picking up right where he left off RB Terrell Fletcher SD Its not exactly the same as earning the startin g RB job in Tennessee or Indianapolis but Fletcher does seem to have nailed down the RB slot in San Diego And thats worth something You have t o decide how much RB Fred Beasley SF We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up TDs He got back in the mix Sunday with carries and a TD The FB for S an Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth th e roll of the dice if youre thin at RB RB Shawn Bryson Buf Finally Bryson does something besides make me look bad for hyping him He rolled up yards on just attempts Sunday and looks to take advantage of Sammy Morris ankle troubles RB Terry Allen NO Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore and Chad Morton failing to astound anyone Allen could get more looks Whether hes got anything left in the tank remains to be seen WRs Moving Up WR David Boston Ari Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be considered an upgrade Hes a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total non factor Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummers attention these days And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind he could do some damage WR Darrell Jackson Sea Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had cooled of late He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center Its tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort h a shot WR Curtis Conway SD Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf resurgence He caught passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues to improve WR Willie Jackson NO Jacksons officially moved past the flash in the pan stage with another solid day Aaron Brooks continues to look good at QB Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no w hes looking good WR Joe Horn NO Again QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime recipient Joe Horn is one of the better stories of and he should continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesnt get untracked WR Bobby Shaw Pit Shaw may still be available in your league as the starting WR opposite Hines Ward He found the endzone again and continues to make some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking WR Terrell Owens SF The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a solid day from Terrell Owens Hes a huge boost to the offense when he ca n go and it looked like hed made progress with the toe Keep an eye out fo r how he responds after the game but I liked what I saw WR Shockmain Davis NE Ok Ill be honest Im pretty much just includi ng him here because hes the owner of the coolest name in the league TEs Moving Up TE Dwayne Carswell Den Carswells finally starting to emerge as the TE of choice in Denver His yards Sunday were second only to San Diegos Freddie Jones You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I d have no trouble starting Carswell each week TE Reggie Kelly Atl One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th e play of Kelly He caught passes for yards Sunday with a TD New QB Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in TE Mark Bruener Pit Bruener makes the list not only for having another solid game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a s he piggy backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t he yard line TE Andrew Glover NO Obviously the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve l of play for all the Saints receivers Glover made a couple of nice plays Sunday including a good looking TD catch Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Shane Matthews Chi Take a seat Shane Cade McNown likely makes his return Folks can hardly wait QB Troy Aikman Dal Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem strange to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro m a huge deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt Clearly the team has zero faith in Aikmans ability to throw the ball QB Shaun King TB I know hes had trouble with the back but passing yards Thats a joke Hell be better but Ive seen enough QB Brad Johnson Was Its the Jeff George show At least untilGeorge looks bad for a few series QB Rob Johnson Buf In leagues that penalize for interceptions youd ha ve been better off starting yourself this weekend than you wouldve Rob Johnson Once again he starts the game but finishes holding a clipboard RBsMoving Down RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons not playing too badly but the team is in shambles After QB Chris Chandler was benched Anderson vented some frustrations saying for all he knew he might be punting this week I dont think well see that but I also dont think well see the days of him seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year RB Shaun Alexander Sea RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an ideal playmate refusing to share the ball Actually hes played so well that Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o f his star When the team is struggling as badly as it is you dont mess with the one thing thats working Philadelphia RBs Forget about them This team will live and die by Donovan McNabb RB Jermaine Fazande SD Evidently Fazande is the nd choice behind Terrell Fletcher now Thats gotta hurt WRs Moving Down WR Joe Jurevicius NYG This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu s as hes been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto r when he returns Hes no lock to go this week but he may be close WR Terrance Mathis Atl Mathis continues to struggle on a team thats in a tailspin New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso n which could spell more bad things for Mathis WRs Torrance Small Charles Johnson Phi Forget about it Donovan McNa bb can be a solid QB without WRs WRs James McKnight Wayne McGarity Dal These guys just arent very McGood QB Troy Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self WR Marcus Robinson Chi Robinsons back troubles were apparently more serious than many had expected It was announced Monday that hell likely miss the rest of the season with a bulging disk in his back It appears h e can get by without surgery but hes certainly not looking good TEs Moving Down TEs Marcus Pollard Ken Dilger Ind Neither of these guys did much Sunday This offense clearly isnt in the same groove it was earlier this year TEs Jackie Harris David LaFleur Dal More bad news associated with Tro y Aikman Neither of these guys were much value Sunday and I dont see that changing very quickly TE Pete Mitchell NYG One of the bigger disappointments at TE this seaso n he just cant get untracked To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

buddy Bob Harris from the TFL Report For more info on subscribing check out flashupdatecfm Enjoy Joe BLEDSOE NOW APPEARS READY TO START VS CHIEFS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to reports out of Foxboro New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe took his regular turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid ay and all indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as usual against the Chiefs Monday night Of course that hardly means Bledsoe is percent healthy hes anything but And whether its jammed bruised sprained fractured broken or just plain old sore the real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th e thumb on his throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability to throw the ball Not surprisingly head coach Bill Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off than hes been the previous three weeks This is the th week of the season There will be a lot of players out there on both teams who will be less than percent and Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac is one of them said Belichick Same thing wit h our quarterback Thats football in the th week of the season Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in Detroit on Thanksgiving day but regressed as the game progressed throwing two crucial fourthquarter interceptions that kept the team from mounting a realistic comeback And even though Bledsoe continues to insist the thumb isnt affecting his throws youd be hardpressed to find any evidence backing that contention The bottom line here says a lack quality depth at the key offensive skill positions around him make it very difficult to rely on Bledsoe for consistent production Other items of interest Michael Felger of the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with the weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at lessthanfull speed coaches would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs The question is whethe r injuryprone JR Redmond will be up to the task If not look for Belichi ck to spread the load between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass Reserve tight end Chris Eitzmann ribs was placed on injured reserve for the season leaving the Pats with one roster spot to fill Starting wid e out Troy Brown leg was the only player not to fully participate at practice and his availability is likely to be determined by a dreaded game day decision MITCHELL REMAINS ON TRACK TO RETURN AS BENGALS STARTER IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals head coach Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as probable to star t at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals tomorrow Mitchell missed last weeks game against Pittsburgh because of a sprained left knee This week his mobility was better as he took percent of the practice snaps and Akili Smith took percent I think probables a good word LeBeau said Were gonna see h ow Scotts knee responds but he looks better every day Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Fridays practice I dont see any reason why I shouldnt be able to go he said LeBeau said Mitchell probably wont need a Sunday morning test as he did last week before the Pittsburgh game I dont think that will be necessary unless some complications develo p between todays workout and Sunday LeBeau said According to those who follow the team closely the Bengals would like to use the teams remaining games to evaluate Mitchell before attempting to resign to the veteran signal caller to compete with thirdyear mantobe Smith for the starting QB job next season Team president Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his first practice in days Thursday Other items of interest Browns continuous and vehement denials havent stopped the speculation regarding his future role with the team SportsLinecom jumped on the bandwagon this week when the reported that the man I like to call the Neanderthal GM is thinking seriously about reducing his own role and bringing in a football man along the lines of former Steeler director o f football operations and current ESPN NFL maven Tom Donahoe to handle the daytoday front office duties Browns response to another report stating that a handful of close friend had advised him to step down and let somebody else handle the teams football operations was classic I dont have five friends he stated flatly And finally Rookie wide out Peter Warrick said his skipping a teammandated eye appointment last Tuesday was an oversight But if he ski ps another one it will cost him Team officials set up the checkup because they believe Warrick needs conta ct lenses Receivers coach Steve Mooshagian felt strongly enough about it to levy a fine if Warrick goes AWOL again GROH UPBEAT AS MARTIN CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ESPNs John Clayton reported last night that New York Jets halfback Curtis Martin took all of his regular snaps Friday and should be fine for Sunday s game against the Colts Martin still has a bruised gluteus maximus but hes in better shape than last week The fact that he opened the week listed a probable rather than starting out as questionable like last week has to be a good sign And if you asked me head coach Al Groh seemed to be quite a bit more upbe at this week at one point responding to a reporters request that he assess Martins current condition by saying Fine fine Thats about as indepth detailed and upbeat reply Ive heard him utter this season But seriously folks The soreness in Martins booty could linger but it wont keep the former Patriot out of the lineup And with Bernie Parmale e emerging as a legitimate threat in a relief role the Jets seem to be capable of getting the job done Also of interest this morning Rookie tight end Anthony Becht now has a neck injury to go along with the sore knee thats bothered him the last two weeks However the youngtster is expected to start and play as usual at this point Fellow rookie Laveranues Coles will miss his second straight game with a knee sprain and his absence has clearly left a void in the teams vertical passing game th e last two weeks On a more postive note Coles was able to get some light work in during practice late this week and could return at or near full speed sometime next week In the meantime Windrell Hayes will continue to come off the bench as the numberthree man until Coles return Former Steeler wide out Malcolm Johnson is becoming part of the Jets syste m as expected Groh said The newcomers biggest challenge is simply learnin g how the Jets operate Hes getting more comfortable with the plays and the words Groh said Every team has a different language and you have to adjust to that He seems to be a quick student he just needs to get through all the lessons And finally While the Jets obviouly have some kind of plan in mind for implementing Leon Johnson its too early to tell when he might be able to follow through on such a plan We saw some of the skills that made him a good player in the past Groh said of Johnsons first workout with the team on Wednesday But you also saw that he started training camp Wednesday After blowing out his left knee in the Jets season opener last year Johnson is eager to work his way back into the mix Some guys take two days to get ready in training camp Groh said Some guys take days or two weeks Thats where we are with Leon Im feeling good Johnson said Its just real good to be back out ther e Thats really all Im concerned with right now The Jets would love for him to return to form quickly so he can resume kickreturn duties soon and relieve Dedric Ward who has not been impressive BIAKABUTUKA OUT HOOVER TO START VS RAMS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Friday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to reports out of Carolina tonight the Panthers will hit the field this Sunday without Tim Biakabutuka who is struggling to overcome a painful turf toe injury for the third week in a row According to ESPN NFL insider John Clayton the Panthers deactivated the former firstround draft pick because they didnt want to ruin his chances of playing the fin al three weeks of the season Brad Hoover an undrafted rookie from Western Carolina will continue to line up as the starting halfback His yard oneTD performance in Monday nights win over the Packers added exponentially to the sudden celebrity status Hoover attained after h is first game as the starter This whole thing has just been crazy he said Ive never gotten this much attention before and Im still trying to figure out how to handle it Count St Louis signal caller Kurt Warner among Hoovers fans I always like that stuff its always good to see guys that were never given much of a chance to come in and really make a name and do well for themselves the former Arena League star noted Heck Biakabutuka even admitted to mixed emotions as he stood on the sidelines watching fans respond to Hoover in a way theyve never responded to him However the former University of Michigan star also realizes just how hard Hoover has worked in almost total obscurity prior to gettin g this break all of which made it hard not to be happy for his teammate But Biakabutuka also found himself just a little bit worried after teammat e Michael Bates told him the story of fella named Wally Pipp who played first base for the New York Yankees Or at least he did until the day this new kid named Lou Gehrig came along and filled in for him I dont want to be Wally Pipp Biakabutuka said earnestly Other items of interest Wide receiver

see thecheatsheet onlineweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just becau se one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is mea nt to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Jamal Anderson Atl vs Seahawk Defense If youve learned anything t his season its start RBs facing the Seahawk defense Fo the year they ra nk in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Over the last four week s theyve really tailed off ranking in rushing yards allowed per gam e Theyre playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a statement Warrick Dunn TB vs Cowboy Defense The Cowboys havent gotten any b etter against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For the year theyre ranked in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs Dunns athletic style will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner d id earlier the season Fred Taylor Jac vs Brown Defense Cleveland struggles against most any RB but especially tough physical rushing teams Taylor and the Jaguars fi t that bill This season has seen some rushing performances of historical significance this year You might see another one this week On paper i t s a dream matchup Tyrone Wheatley Oak vs Steeler Defense I know its hard to believe but the numbers show that over the past four weeks Pittsburgh ranks in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre allowing yards rushing on the ground Granted Fred Taylor Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into that number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isnt too far down below thei r class Hes healthier now than he has been in a while Ricky Watters Sea vs Falcon Defense Ive been a Ricky Watters fan since the er days One of the best combinations of rushing and receiving in some time Hes had an age defying season and the roll should continue against a Falcon unit thats been awful defending the run lately For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For th e year theyre in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Eve ryone keeps wondering when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets blown out here which I have hard time seeing I think youll see plent y of Ricky Watters Corey Dillon Cin vs Cardinal Defense Like Fred Taylor vs Cleveland this one looks almost too good to be true on paper They dont always t urn out that way in reality but youve got to be drooling over this game if you re a Dillon owner His running in the lack of a real passing game threat is an amazing feat Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be effective throwing the ball which will help even more Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Tony Richardson Kimble Anders KC vs Patriot Defense Our support o f Christian Okoye last week for a Chief RB didnt garner much support fro m the KC coaching staff so it looks like another week of Richardson Anders Anders actually got plenty of carries last week and promptly did very litt le with them Richardson appears to be the better back right now but who know s how this will play out Its hard for me to advocate either But if y ou do go with one know that theyll be facing a pretty soft New England rush defense that ranks in rushing yards allowed per gameover the last fo ur weeks Tshimanga Biakabutuka Brad Hoover Car vs Rams Defense Biakabutuka found there was no rehabilitation method quite as effective as folk s chanting Hoooooover on Monday night Amazing how that consis tently works Biakabutuka has been upgraded to probable but Im not convinced Hoover just takes his place back on the bench Youll likely see both go The Rams still give up a good bit of yardage on the ground lately averagin g yards per game over the last four weeks That ranks them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB JR Redmond NE vs Chief Defense The Patriots are a tough team to figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny But if he can hold them together Ive got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here Th e Chiefs rank over the past four weeks in rushing yards allowed per gam e For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing R B Keep an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he cant go all bets are off b ut if he can keep the defense honest I like Redmonds chances here Of cour se you have to know the risks that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong way Edgerrin James Ind vs Jets Defense The NFL is the ultimate game of watching to see what others do You can bet the Colts are aware of the success Chicagos James Allen had last week rushing and fumbling the ball against New York I think youll see a steady diet of Edgerrin doing t he same thing hopefully not fumbling though James is a no brainer star t him against virtually any team unless youre so loaded at RB its no t fair Eddie George Ten vs Eagle Defense Philadelphia isnt quite as tough vs the run as their reputation might have you believe Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB But you can pretty much throw those numbers out when its Eddie George Hell ge t his yards the hard way Id be very surprised if you dont see George e xhibit some leadership here and put together a solid effort Curtis Martin NYJ vs Colts Defense It sounds like Curtis Martin is ju st going to have to play with the strained buttocks youve heard enough jokes by now Ill spare you The Indy defense is definitely vulnerable to the rush For the season they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs This game will be in New York and the Colts are soft when it s cold outside so Martin could have an edge James Allen Chi vs Green Bay Lets give Allen the benefit of the d oubt and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced although I didnt see Curtis Martin fumble three times and he was there too If he can fin d the handle on the ball hell be fine as he actually ran very while when he managed to hang on to the football Green Bay proved Monday night they can t stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears and for Allen Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Travis Prentice Jamel White Cle vs Jaguar Defense This is one of those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper Jacksonville has yielded an average of yards rushing per game over the last four weeks That ranks them They also rank for the year i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs But theyre playing better than that now I believe And the Browns are just playing out the season And the bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel White has looked impressive Its a decent matchup for Cleveland but Id probably shy from these guys if it were me Michael Pittman Ari vs Bengal Defense A case of both sides being bette r than what many people think Michael Pittman is a player Since Vince Tobin left its been pretty much Pittmans show on the ground much to the chagrin of Thomas Jones owners And on the other side of the ball the Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for On the ground they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB S o this once could truly go either way Id feel ok with Pittman if he was my guy but I wouldnt be overly excited Robert Smith Min vs Lion Defense This isnt the best matchup in the world for Smith but you have to start him If nothing else than to get an early lead on your opponent with a Thursday night game Cmon that s worth something Seriously Smith is one of the elite RBs right now bu t Detroit is playing pretty tough against the run ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Hes a starter though just play him Ahman Green GB vs Bear Defense Find a nice toasty place to watch this one Chicago in December At night Thats football With Dorsey Lev ens likely gone for the year the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man Chicago has a tough run defense led by all world rookie Brian Urlacher I told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him Vanilla Freak and now youre seeing why I love this kid These guys are professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy with the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature keeps dropping Lamar Smith Mia vs Bills Defense Smith practiced Wednesday and while it s awful early to make a definitive call it looks like hell start Sund ay The Bufallo defense is solid against the rush They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Although for the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Although if Smith can return to his awesome form before the injury hell be a load The Dolphins will rely on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus not that good to begin with Marshall Faulk StL vs Panther Defense Lets hope Faulk gets back to his old form And lets hope the Panther defense gets back more their old rushing defense form Over the last four games Carolina ranks in rushing yards allowed per game But for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB It sounds to me like coach Mi ke Martz wont make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best we apons in Faulk Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Shawn Bryson Sammy Morris Antowain Smith Buf vs Miami Defense Believe it or not the Dolphin Defense ranks just in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Granted of those games don t factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have thought The Bills rushing game is a mess The team is calling Morris ankle questionable so well have to wait and see Bryson has done very little with the opportunity and we know Smith didnt produce or we woul d have never seen so much of Bryson and Morris With a healthy Zach Thomas Id probably shy a bit from any of these guys Emmitt Smith Dal vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith said hed never been knocked out in his career but thats what happened Thursday Hes bo unced back quickly and says hell certainly be the starter Sunday The Bucs are tough but not invincible Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game giving up yards per game on the ground Emmitts made a living running the ball against tough defenses over his career so Im not overly concerned with the matchup Hes a gamer and Id say hes probably a starter for most owners this week even facing Tampa Bay Stephen Davis Was vs Giants Defense Be very leery here Stephen Dav is demonstrated last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of salt Players are notoriously optimistic about their chances for recoveri ng from injury Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I w as sure hed start Id think very hard about going elsewhere this week Its not like hes facing Seattle and this is a dream matchup or something The Giants are tough against the run ranking for the year in Fantasy Point s allowed to the opposing RB So unless you know for sure hes going I d strongly consider my other options Terrell Fletcher SD vs er Defense Fletcher is probable with a rib fracture which must sound worse than it is Either that or hes one tou gh guy The problem is that San Francisco is playing much improved defense lately Against the rush over the last four weeks they rank in rushi ng yards allowed per game Thats a marked contrast to their year long numbers where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Adding Fletchers ribs to the improved Defense I dont see much fro m San Diego on the ground Sunday Ron Dayne Tiki Barber NYG vs Redskins To me Barber is looking muc h more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I dont see New York taking a lead where they can grind out the clock If youre a Dayne own er youre painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in favor of Barber when his team trails The Giants are a good team but I d on t see them jumping all over Washington Plus the Redskins play very good rush defense For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to t he opposing RB and over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game James Stewart Det vs Viking Defense Stewarts great game against Ta mpa Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but hes go t a surprisingly tough situation here Minnesota over the last four weeks ran ks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Part of that has to do with the Vikings explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up but part of it is that the Vikings are just improved there LB Dwayne Rud d should miss the game with a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but Im still not overly excited about the matchup Still though Stewart is one of the better backs and Id think hes likely a starter for your team unless youre loaded with RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Darnell Autry Stanley Pritchett Phi vs Titan Defense The Eagle RBs have been very little factor and I dont see them all of a sudden emerg ing against a very tough Tennessee defense Especially one in a foul mood afte r another last second loss from the kicker Its a tough job but QB Don ovan McNabb carries this team almost solely on his shoulders He could be the teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs For th e year the Titans rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Mike Anderson Den vs Saints Defense I like Mike Anderson and hes a great story but hes got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans The Saints rank for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last four games they rank in rushing yards allowed pe r game Theyve just averaged yards per game allowed rushing Anders on is still probably worth a start unless youre really deep at RB but just b e aware hes facing a tough defense Charlie Garner SF vs Charger Defense With a week off to prepare Garne r comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first victory Theyre playing rush defense like were accustomed to seei ng from San Diego ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Garner isnt your normal back but hes facing a tough game h ere I d still start him as hes got that big play potential with the ability to go the distance at any time but Im not excited about the matchup Jerome Bettis Pit vs Raider Defense Jerome Bettis was built for grinding down defenses in the December cold but hell have a tough match up this week against Oakland The Raiders rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Thats partly why their passing defe nse is so bad teams cant run so they go to the air I like Bettis and I t hink hell be able to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a difficult matchup here Jerald Moore Chad Morton NO vs Bronco Defense Assuming Moore is ok with his neck stinger hell be running behind his outstanding OL but t his is a tough matchup against the Denver Defense thats remained tough vs the run Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing an average of yards per game Ricky Watters and Seattle only managed to post against them Sunday Moore looks to get the majority of carries and goalline work so hes the better option at this point assuming he can go But even healthy hes got his work cut out for him To unsubscribe from this group

still in the hunt this late in the year you have to call a successful campaign Enjoy it Its an intense time and you cant slack off n ow but its also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens in t he next few weeks Its tough enough just to get to this point Great w ork From my perspective its interesting in that the actual number of folks who read the material drops way off this time of year But the other side of the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading shoots throu gh the roof There may not be as many folks reading as there were in September but the ones that are here are into in a big way Ill do my dead level best to keep up my end of the bargain and provide the best info I can all the way to the week games Lets get at it Joe Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Passing Game Matchups Heres how I see the matchups this week Please note see the cheatsheet online will be availablelate Wednesday evening atweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be mor e favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more too l in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software f or more info The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position numbers are from ESPNcom Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Bronco Defense I stuck my neck out a bit last week with QB Aaron Brooks but he came though for me This week he draws a great matchup with a Denver defense thats not been able to sto p anyone through the air Over the last four weeks they rank in passi ng yards allowed per game Denver has averaged giving up yards passing p er game over that span With CB Ray Crockett out with a torn hamstring Jim my Spencer will fill in for him again this week He and Terrell Buckley can definitely be beaten Brooks will focus on WR Joe Horn his primary weapon but Willie Jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option RB Chad Morton catches the ball pretty well out of the backfield TE Aaron Glove r still is total non factor for Fantasy purposes Im doing my best to not get carried away with Brooks Keep telling yourself the young man has exactly games of NFL experience On the other hand there comes a time when you take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes This gu y isnt playing like a game rookie and the Denver defense is awful St Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense I want to believe I believe in Kurt Warner and I believe hell get his Rams back on track As much as anything I believe youll see Marshall Faulk at least see more action than he saw last week Warners an MVP but I think its Faulk that make s this team go He creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commi t safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game If the defense plays the pass then Faulk can kill them with the run or short passes After last week Id be shocked if coach Mike Martz doesnt get back to utilizinghisstar RBmore Kurt Warner makes his return and I m guessing he picks up where he left off Thats not what youd expec t to happen but Warners made a career of exceeding expectations If he s on your roster I think you have to go with him Especially against this defense Carolina ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For WRs its always tough to pick Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are the sure guys but honestly Ricky Proehls been on fire lately AzZahir Hakim is always worth a shot too Any one of these guy s can go off TE Roland Williams suffers with so many good receivers but he s a decent producer too Atlanta Passing Game vs Seattle Defense This one is a pure matchup play as Dan Reeves makes the move for startingQB Doug Johnson over the fading Chris Chandler Im not a big fan of either but if you find yourself f aced with the prospect of starting a Falcon QB this is the week to do it if yo u re ever going to The Seahawks defense is less like a hawk and more like an albatross around Mike Holmgrens neck Theyre awful Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Good luck picki ng the WR as Terrance Mathis has been invisible lately while Shawn Jefferson is making a resurgence A few weeks ago it was Mathis who was hot while Jefferson faded If you made me pick one Id reluctantly go with Jefferson TE Reggie Kelly did catch passes Sunday but Im not count ing on him for too much Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Raider Defense KorDELLKorDELLKorDE LL What brought this guy back to life I dunno but you can bet coach Bill Cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling Kordell Stewar t looks to be playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much o f the game at this level is mental No one ever doubted his physical skills The obvious spark seems to have been the benching of WR Plaxico Burress and the inspired play of Hines Ward I think its ironic that W ard was very much a Kordelllike Slash player in college at Georgia Bobby Shaw is getting into the act and producing from the WR slot and wonders of wonders TE Mark Bruener caught a TD Sunday You know things are changin g when Bruener gets in the endzone The Raiders are an extremely good football team but stopping teams through the air is their Achilles heel Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Another interesting aspect o f writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December ar e stocked with the obvious stars QB Scott Mitchell likely doesnt fall into that star category and I doubt many folks are faced with the decis ion to start him this week but if hes your best QB this might be your lucky week First of all lets assume he gets the knee ready to go This e arly in the week thats honestly a shaky assumption Well know more l ater But if he can go he could do some damage against an awful Cardinal defense WR Peter Warrick could be a decent play too although Aeneas Williams is a solid cover guy Hes hard to count out though just beca use of his home run ability Funny how I dont see many people complaining about his times now RB Corey Dillon is the only other starter on this team but well catch up with him in the rushing Matchups Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Lets be clear Im no Jake Plummer fan but the truth of the matter is hes got a pretty decent matc hup this week Hes reportedly making good progress and should start Sunda y Partly because hes better partly because Dave Brown was just awful Worse than Plummer has a nasty ring to it But this Bengal pa ss defense is pretty bad Over the past four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game WRs David Boston has the physical tools to do some damage and Frank Sanders has the experience to make an impact Remember this is the unit that made Pittsburgh look like the Rams last week New York Jets Passing Game vs Colts Defense The Jets have been up and do wn a bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling Indianapolis defense The pathetic Colt pass rush only has sacks in th e last games QB Vinny Testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup with yards and TD WR Wayne Chrebets been in a funk lately but in their week he went off catching passes for Sure some of it was late but garbage stats count too Dedric Ward caught just yards worth of passes but he scored in that game Hes come on lately after fadin g early Rookie WR Laveranues Coles will miss another game it appears RB Curtis Martin still is struggling to get healthy and that will hurt a little TE Anthony Becht is a bright spot as hes beginning to contrib ute December in New York will make a difference to this soft Colt team which doesnt play as well in the cold Detroit Passing Game vs Viking Defense Charlie Batch continued to look good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his well deserved candybone label with a gutsy performance on Thanksgiving His ribs are reportedly better and he had a nice practice Tuesday throwing the ball The Viking secondary could have matchup troubles with WRs Johnnie Morton a nd Herman Moore Over the last four weeks Minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs The Vikings are tough on TEs ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to TEs for the year but TE David Sloan has played very well of late He ranks in Fantasy Points among TEs over the last games and is well worth a start here Denver Passing Game vs Saints Defense For all the hype generated by New Orleans defense they give up tons of yards passing Over the last fo ur weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game They do sack the QB a ton over the last four weeks but they still give up the yards I t s kind of unusual to see that Theyll be facing Gus Frerotte and a Den ver team thats trying to find their way Frerottes been up and down after his monster week game The Saints continue to drop like flies and the loss of CB Fred Weary will definitely hurt Both WRs Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey are solid plays as always And as crazy as it sounds either one of the headed TE monster in Dwayne Carswell and Desmond Clark are decen t options too Byron Chamberlain normally makes it a headed TE monster bu t hes nursing a bad Achilles tendon and didnt play last week As no ted above Denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a hig h scoring affair I doubt you could have predicted a shootout between Aaron Brooks and Gus Frerotte months ago but thats why they play the games Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Chicago Passing Game vs Packer Defense Im torn here You probably saw how weak the Packer defense looked Monday night They couldnt do muc h of anything But on the other hand the Bears will likely go with Shane Matthews and hes been just awful lately Like worse than Dave Brown kind of bad One would think hed improve against this defense but hell have to make great strides just to get reach average Owners of WR Marcus Robinson feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately wit h Matthews at the helm Still though theres some hope On a brighter spot Matthews does seem comfortable throwing to Eddie Kennison who had passes thrown to him Sunday compared to Robinsons Ive hear rum ors that Chicago may start a TE but that news is unconfirmed at this time In t he for real rumor department QB Cade McNown is making noise about wanting to start this week but I think its still a week early New England Passing Game vs Chief Defense Kansas City and New England ar e two once proud teams that are struggling This week a banged up Drew Bledsoefaces a pass defense thats been vulnerable Over the last fou r weeks Kansas City ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year KC ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs Bledsoe bruised a knee in Thursdays game but played through it and should be o k Keep an eye on him though as he was added to the injury report this week a s Questionable As long as Bledsoe plays WR Terry Glennshould be a good option as hes clearly the guy in that offense over Troy Brown TE Rod Rutledge caught passes last week so he may start to make some noise With all those productive years throwing to Ben Coates you know Bledsoe would love to have a solid TE Carolina Passing Game vs Rams Defense Even if you want to pin Carolina s Monday Night performance on a weak Green Bay defense credit still must be given to Steve Beuerleinand the Panthers The immobile Beuerlein hung in there and delivered Hes facing a Rams defense that even with Bud Car sons help still ranks in passing yards allowed per game Granted that s a big improvement Beuerleins numbers may be helped by the return of Ram QB Kurt Warner as theres nothing like the other team rolling up points to get your QBs arm loose WR Muhsin Muhammad had the dominating game we all know he can and looked overpowering The hamstring injury was supposed to be with him all year but he looks good to me Another boost for Beuerlein will be if WR Donald Hayescan get back on the field as early reports are hoping for Even TE Kris Mangumbe the one guy in your leag ue that doesnt say magnum like the gun has been looking good For the year St Louis ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the TE so he could be worth a shot Jacksonville Passing Game vs Browns Defense This one really is a case of misdirection as QB Mark Brunellisnt as good as many people think and the Browns pass defense isnt as bad as most people assume Cleveland rank s in passing yards allowed per game And for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs which really surprises people The reason is that their rush defense is awful and teams choose to run instead But all you really care about are the stats Brunell should be ok but not great here as the Jaguars look to take out a seasons worth of frustrat ions on the Browns Jimmy Smithand Keenan McCardellare solid choices as usual Even the much maligned by me anyway rookie R Jay Sowardproduc ed last week Soward could actually be bad news for McCardell and Smith as there were times when Brunell really seemed to force the ball his way T E Kyle Bradyis solid But honestly I think this will be the Fred Taylor on the ground show against a weak rush unit Washington Passing Game vs Giant Defense Brad Johnsonmakes his return this week taking over for Jeff George Its interesting to watch how t he Redskins spin this transition According to Washington Johnson starting has nothing to do with Jeff Georges less than spectacular play or reco rd Johnson was the starter all along regardless of how George played yada yada This type of talk makes it easier to sell the fans Jeff Geor ge as the starting QB next year Well see for the record Im a George fan and have been for a while Myself and other guys are pretty much it Like most players in this could go either way category Johnson has good and bad points this week On the upside the Giants defense has shown itself to be vulnerable to the pass The Redskins also hope to have RB Stephen Davisthis week His presence does a great deal for the passing game On the downside Johnson will likely be rusty He may still be feeling some lingering effects of the injury Secondly his best WR Albert Connellmay play but hes nowhere near full speed James Thrashfilled in admirably for Connell and looks to be a good play this wee k as well It looks like Irving Fryarwill get the start opposite Thrash The ageless wonder might do something if Jason Sehorn stays with Thrash as Dave Thomas is by far the weaker CB TE Stephen Alexanderis a steady performer although FB Larry Centerssteals too many of the short passes th at could go to Alexander New York Giant Passing Game vs Redskin Defense A good defense takes on a good passing offense I guess thats why this matchup is in this colu mn Over the last four weeks Washington ranks in passing yards allowed p er game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing Q Bs so theyre pretty tough QB Kerry Collinshas quietly played extremely well over the last month Hes thrown for yards and TDs over the last games That puts him at in Fantasy Points among QBs over that time span WR Amani Toomercontinues to play great football and is definitely worth a shot Joe Jureviciusfills in for the injured Ike Hilliard again and hes a solid choice as Collins didnt hesitate to throw him the ball often TE Pete Mitchell is tough to depend on as he gets more catches but Dan Campbellgrabs the TDs it seems Im not too excited about ei ther guy San Diego Passing Game vs er Defense My Charger buddies have cautioned me about jumping on the Ryan LeafBandwagon That was right after Id se nt a group email at halftime of the SD KC game to some friends boasting about my QB Leaf Of course we know the nd half didnt go quit e as well as the first and I came back to reality But theres some truth to the i dea Leaf is becoming an NFL QB I personally had doubts if wed ever see i t but I think its starting to happen And this week against a San Francisc o defense he could make some more strides It should be noted the ers ar e much better on pass defense than they had been Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game which is a huge upgrade from where they had been For the year though they still rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Leaf has some extremely solid receivers TE Freddie Jonesis his best target but veteran WRs Jeff Graha m and Curtis Conwayare more than capable Youd think that San Francis co will score some points so there could be some fireworks Id shy away f rom Leaf but Jones in particular could be a very nice play San Francisco Passing Game vs Charger Defense The Charger defense held Kansas City down last week but I think that had more to do with Warren Moo n s senior citizen status than it did the Charger D Granted theyre improving but I think San Francisco should be able to move the ball Ove r the last four weeks San Diego ranks in passing yards allowed per game QB Jeff Garciais coming off a bye week and should be rested and prepared His biggest problem will be the toe injury to WR Terrell Owens Owens was unable to complete practice Monday and its now looking like it could be later this week before he sees the practice field Coach Steve Mariucci didnt sound too optimistic Although I can imagine worse scenarios for a WR than having Jerry Riceas your best WR Owens will definitely be missed but JJ Stokesand Tai Streetswill fill in just fine There had been some talk from Mariucci about resting Garcia to see how the rookie QBs Gio Carmazzi and Tim Rattay would fare in game situations I think this is just talk at this point I dont really see the Chargers blowing out San Francisco to the point Garcia could be pulled If Garcia gets San Francisco such a lead that he could be pulled he would have probably earned a great day of stats by then anyway At least for this week Im thinking hell be fine in the playing time department Minnesota Passing Game vs Lion Defense Ok this is tough matchup for the Vikings Detroit ranks in passing yards allowed per gameover the last four games But the Lions are dealing with several injuries in their secondary including Safety Ron Rice leg probable Kurt Schulz ankledoubtful and nickel back Marquis Walker wristout Still though youre crazy if you dont start QB Daunte Culpepperand WRs Randy M ossand Cris Carter Theyre just too good Kansas City Passing Game vs Patriot Defense Its early to make a call but its looking like QB Elvis Grbacwill be back this week Thats gr eat news for Chief fans and Fantasy Owners The Patriots rank in passing yar ds allowed per game over the last four weeks but those numbers are a little skewed as Detroit Cincinnati Cleveland and Buffalo were the opponents Its not like they shut down the Rams or ers Grbac will look to ge t his target TE Tony Gonzalezback on track after he was shut out by the Chargers I dont think youll see that again with Grbac under cent er WR Derrick Alexanderis an excellent target too Rookie Sylvester Morrisseems to be fading instead of getting better He may be hitting th e infamous rookie wall Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Dallas Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith seems recovered from his knockout slap Thursday and says hell start That s good news for all aspects of the Dallas offense QB Troy Aikmansquares off again st a Tampa defense thats bark is worse than its bite Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Although they have registered sacks over that span which is towards the top of the league Theyre solid though WRs Wayne McGarityand James McKnighta re showing theyre not anything exceptional TE Jackie Harriswas injure d last week and David LaFluerwoke up with a great game Cleveland Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense One has to ask if anyone really cares whether QBsDoug Pedersonor Spergon Wynngets the majority of the snaps I think I can say fairly confidently that neither of these guys ha ve been figuring heavily into your plans The Jaguar defense has improved significantly of late They rank in passing yards allowed per gameover the last four weeks and they should be plenty good enough to contain the Browns This team never really had a chance once Tim Couch an d Errict Rhett went down Kevin Johnsonand David Patten handle the WR duties but I cant advocate either with a clear conscience TE AaronSh ea will start for the Browns but probably not for your FF Team Green Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense Its hard to know what to thin k about Green Bay One game they look like the Packers of old with Favre working his magic and the next they look like a shell of their former selves as they did on Monday Night against a Carolina team that had no business handling them as they did Brett Favreis still a decent bet t o sling a few TDs on any Sunday but hes sadly become just an average Fan tasy QB Lately the Bears have been tough against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Although for th e year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Favre will have the very disappointing Antonio Freemanto throw to although Bil l Schroederis putting up better numbers the last few weeks He has another advantage in that while Freeman will likely draw CB Thomas Smith Schroede r likely goes against Jerry Azumah Remember Schroeder came up huge in the week matchup with TDs in the th quarter For a TE Id go with Bu bba Franksalthough whenever I say that it seems Tyrone Daviscatches a TD Seattle Passing Game vs Falcon Defense This is an interesting game as tw o proud coaches in Dan Reeves and Mike Holmgren lead teams that are floundering The one bright spot for the Falcons is that theyve yield ed few yards passing although the glass is half empty crowd will poin t out that the reason for that is the weak rush defense Why throw the ball whe n you can run on Atlanta Regardless of the reason teams dont throw mu ch against the Falcons and I dont look for QB Jon Kitnato completely bre ak that trend Hell be looking to quiet producers Sean Dawkinsand Derric k Mayes Dawkins in particular has been exceptional over the last few weeks and is probably worth a start Indianapolis Passing Game vs Jets Defense I love Peyton Manningbut he s a guy that doesnt always post the Fantasy Football numbers to match hi s hype Hes a solid producer wholl very rarely burn you but hes also not too subject to the yard TD day With that said I think youll see another good solid day from him against a Jet defense thats tough Ov er the last four weeks New York ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Manning will try to jump start his team thats floundering a bit The y know they need a win and a team like this can be tough when cornered Im not heeding the grumblings about WR Marvin Harrison Hes fine He ca ught TDs last week and has stated he needs to get on a mission althou gh he needs some help Jerome Pathonhad some horrendous drops EG Greenhopes to be back this week from a knee injury and that will be good news Terrenc e Wilkins and Pathon just arent getting it done TEs Marcus Pollardand Ken Dilgerboth catch just enough to make neither guy very valuable Oakland Passing Game vs Steeler Defense QB Rich Gannonis garnering lots of talk about the league MVP Could be But hes got a tough matchup th is week against a Steeler team playing with confidence Pittsburgh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the seaso n they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB so thats strong WRTim Brownis the clear cut target of choice and that makes thing s great for Brown owners You know hell get his touches Andre Risonand James Jettwill get the scraps left over TE Ricky Dudleyis a guy who you play totally at your own risk Hes just as liable to go catchless as he is score TDs Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Miami Passing Game vs Bills Defense Lets seeJay Fiedlercoming back from a shoulder injury in what will likely be horrible weather conditions against the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Thats what youve got in this game and its e nough to have me looking elsewhere if Ive got Dolphin passing game players I d start who ever you did last week if Fiedler is your QB If you have to start a Miami WR Id roll the dice on the unheralded Leslie Shepherdw hos catching more than anyone thought he would Slim pickings with this matchup after that Buffalo Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense Lets seeRob Johnsoncom ing back from his latest injury in what will likely be horrible weather conditions against the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks This sounds familiar Seriously this game ought to be a defensive struggle as two dominant defenses square off in the snow against mediocre offenses Rob Johnson will get the start but as usual wont finish the game Eric Mouldswill gather the majority of catches and is probably too good not to start just because hes so talented and he doe s grab the lions share of passes thrown TE Jay Reimersmais fast regaining his place as one of the best TEs in the game and depending on the weather here he could be the best receiving choice Philadelphia Passing Game vs Titan Defense Understand that this is a bad matchup for Donovan McNabband the Eagles but so was last week against Washington And all McNabb did was win Offensive Player of the Week honors Outside of McNabb and TE Chad Lewis I cant recommend any oth er players as starters Neither WRsCharles Johnsonor Torrance Smallscare anyone The Titans are an athletic and physical unit that youd think would give McNabb trouble And truthfully the Washington game would have likely been different if spy LaVarr Arrington hadnt been hurt early The lack of a passing game threat really hurts as Tennessee will likely be able to handle the WRs with man coverage and commit more personnel to the run and McNabb Still if hes by far your best QB Id roll the dice with him as hes made a season out of proving people wrong Tennessee Passing Game vs Eagle Defense Steve McNairranks among QB s over the last games in Fantasy Points per game Thats not real solid I dont see him suddenly improving his play against an Eagle defense that ranks in passing yards allowed per game And for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB The Eagles have sacks over the last games and while McNair is tough guy to sack its obvio us the Eagles will pressure him His WR corps in Derrick Masonand Chris Sandersarent the greatest As usual his best option will be TE Fran k Wycheck Wycheck struggled last week with some uncharacteristic drops bu t this week he could be an asset as McNair likely wont have a lot of tim e to throw Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Who knows where the Shaun KingRoller Coaster Ride will take us this week Hes nursing a back s train but practiced Wednesday and looks good to go The Cowboys surprisingly hav e played decent pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game Of course thats largely because no team feels the need to throw the b all when they can run at will King will spread the ball between WRs Keyshaw n Johnsonand Jacquez Green Im not especially excited about either bu t it s very hard to turn your back on Keyshawn TE Dave Mooreis a fine produc er and Id feel comfortable starting him To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

and Cats in the scoring box was one of the more annoying moves theyve made this season Cats Thats so lame Enough of that lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head down the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from th e sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these players it s inevitable that some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players th at are moving In other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on t he downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league I t just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewi se a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he s still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make a ll the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Kordell Stewart Pit Time to give props where props are due Kordel l looks like a new man Actually he looks like the old Kordell The GOOD old Kordell Over the last three weeks he ranks as the QB in my Performance TD system based on FF points per game Gotta hand it to Bi ll Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting WRs like that but Hines Ward has delivered Its probably not the best thing for Jerome Betti s owners but Stewarts rushing TDs over the last weeks are huge QB Aaron Brooks NO Brooks made my upgrade list last week and I put my money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league to pick him up last week as a free agent I said last week that wed see how he does with the pressure on all week Obviously this is one cool kid If y ou saw the footage of him in the tunnel before the game he looked like he was ready to go out and play a game of flag football or something He made some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times The obvious comparison is a young Randall Cunningham Hes skinny and has a littl e bit of those Cunningham crazy legs Plus hes got a big arm with that whipp y motion But the biggest thing that impresses me about Brooks is his poise Grab him if hes available in your league I asked my friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks Tony had him ranked higher than Shaun King before the draft Heres wha t the TFY Draft Preview had for Brooks AARON BROOKS Virginia Fifth year senior who completed of his passes throwing for yards touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the ball times for yards averaging yards per carry with five more scores Led the ACC i n passing efficiency two seasons ago throwing for Go od athlete who has shown great improvement in his quarterback skills the last season and a half Smooth and fluid sets his feet in the pocket shows good strength and stands his ground when being rushed Has a live arm ca n thread a needle throws ropes and his deep passes have speed Effective throwing on the run squares his shoulders and quickly releases the ball Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers pulls the ball down running betwee n the tackles While he has improved his accuracy and places his passes wel l he often overthrows receivers The further down the field or out to the flanks he must get the ball the more his accuracy struggles Must do a better job reading and recognizing defenses stop staring down his primary target and not hold the ball so long while in the pocket A player who turned himself into a good prospect with a solid senior campaign Mid to late Sixth Round Thanks Tony Be sure to check out Tonys great info at wwwTFYDraftPreviewcom QB Kurt Warner StL Warners chomping at the bit and has been named the starter this week relieving Trent Green Keep an eye out on how he looks in practice Coach Mike Martz said last week he was concerned about Warner s grip strength and ability to put rotation on the ball Im thinking he ll be good to go QB Donovan McNabb Phi What else can you say about this guy Take awa y his running game No problem Give him WRs that would struggle to make a division I team No problem He finds a way to get it done He looks to me like hes beginning to reach the level of dominance he enjoyed at Syracuse where he was unstoppable Its especially impressive as team s know what hes going and still cant stop him It should be noted th at LaVarr Arrington was injured early and he was the designated spy b ut still it was an impressive performance against a very good Washington defense I see little reason why he wont continue although he really needs help at WR QB Trent Dilfer Bal I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer might pla y the late season Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives anothe r struggling QBs career Dilfer seems very comfortable with what Bill ick is asking him to do and brings a little fire and attitude to the offense that had been missing I like what theyre doing and dont see why it wont continue Although dont forget theyre off this week QB Brad Johnson Was Jeff George yields to the young man from Florida State His knee is reportedly good to go and hes been cleared by the trainers as fit to start Considering the troubles the team endured with George at the helm Johnson has already been named the starter Hell be working with a nicked WR corps so well see how he fares QB Ryan Leaf SD Kordell Stewart Trent Dilfer and Ryan Leaf You gott a be kidding me But after another solid outing you cant deny Leaf is making plays Granted he still throws the ugly interceptions and he ge ts hurt almost as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for you if you need a spot QB Hes got one of the top TEs in the game with Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are veterans who can make a difference This win will have to buoy the spirits and enthusiasm RBs Moving Up RB Mike Anderson Den Once is a coincidence Twice is a trend Youv e got to start handing credit to Mike Shanahan Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia k and that offensive line Like everyone else I marveled at the way Olandis Gary was able to run last year when Terrell Davis went down What a great job of scouting we all thought But hey Gary was a pretty highly touted back But Mike Anderson Andersons a fine back but Ive got to believe its a team deal here The good news is that Andersons team isn t going anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell Davis recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment Watch this during the week b ut it wouldnt surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game And as l ong as Anderson rolls up rushing yards a game like he did Sunday you won t see Shanahan crying over TD being out Granted of those yards came on one big run but he had a great game any way you slice it RB Jamal Lewis Bal Ive been eating crow Raven for a while now a s I was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at this level after a very disappointing season at Tennessee Lewis is running like he did as a Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have the best blend of speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George Coach Brian Billick has the Raven offense firing on all cylinders and Lewi s remains a huge part of it His only down side is that hes off this we ek with a bye But that week matchup against Arizona is looking very tasty RB Corey Dillon Cin Considering what he does with that surrounding cas t I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back in the NFL There have been few passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the Bengals yet Dillon continues to pound out the yards when defenses know exactly whats coming at them Its amazing to watch I dont k now how long he can keep it up but hes got the woeful Cardinals this week and you have to like that RB Warrick Dunn TB Dunn made the upgrade list last week in the wake of Mike Alstotts knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his owners Sunday with total yards including TDs There was some talk about him sharing carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the ball for Tampa Bay Look for more of the same from the Bucs and new offensive coordinator Warren Sapp Seriously Dunn showed he could hand le rushing attempts and I think youll continue to see them go with what s working RB Michael Pittman Ari Pittman may be the lone bright spot on the Arizona team I told you last week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and you saw the results last night as Pittman rambled for yards on only carries ypc Like Corey Dillon the surrounding team kills his value but if he ran for a team that held a lead hed be awesome Unfortunate ly I dont see Arizona turning into such a team anytime soon so dont get too excited But overall I like the guy a lot RB Richie Anderson NYJ Each year there are always unheralded guys who post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners Many tim es they are RBs who quietly post yardage and FF points receiving the ball Anderson is a prime example of one such player this year asare Tony Richardson and Stanley Pritchett Hes caught passes over the last games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus that trend wil l likely continue RB Robert Holcombe StL It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see th at Marshall Faulk isnt Red flags went up across the country when M ike Martz elected to give Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday weeks ago that would have been Faulks carry all day long Holcombe looks to benefit if Faulks workload continues to be decreased RB Brad Hoover Car Aside from having one of those cool names the fans can yell whenever he does something good Hoover has shown to be a capable replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka He doesnt have the physical tools of a Biakabutuka but you cant deny he hasnt been effective It wouldnt surprise me a bit to see Hoover continue to see action WRs Moving Up WR Marvin Harrison Ind Harrison stated before Sundays game that he needed to get on a mission Looked like he started towards that e nd with TD catches and he could have had another Yes youd like to see mo re than catches but Ill take TDs any week Harrisons biggest worr y is that Peyton Manning can stay calm enough not to strangle Jerome Pathon for dropping easy balls Harrison is fine and actually looking better in my eyes WR Hines Ward Pit Does anyone else find it interesting to see Kordell Stewart throwing the ball to another slash type player in Hines Wa rd Ward doesnt have the name of a Plaxico Burress but hes certainly m ore productive If Im Burress Id be for finding a baseball cap that I was comfortable with WR Amani Toomer NYG Toomers back in a big way He had us worried t here for a stretch earlier but hes playing very well right now especially with Ike Hilliard out QB Kerry Collins has settled into a nice rhythm and coach Jim Fassell is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a playoff slot Look forToomer and Collins to be a big part of making that happen WR Sean Dawkins Ind With his size Ive always wondered why he isnt better Hes showing over the last few games that mayb e he is Over the last games he rates as the WR in Fantasy Points per game It doesnt seem to make a great deal of difference to him whethe r it s Jon Kitna or Brock Huard throwing the ball he just delivers WR Peter Warrick CinGarbage time or not he scored another TD this week and hes a great gamble if you need to roll the dice for a home run Y es hes as liable to go for as he is score a TD but sometimes those are the kinds of gambles that pay big The team reportedly was forcing him t o see an eye doctor for contact lenses This could be like Charlie Sheen in Major League with the new glasses Seriously if hes had bad vision t hats been limiting him look out once he gets the contacts WR Joe Jurevicius NYG With Ike Hilliard out Jurevicius got all he eve r wanted a chance And hes making the most of it Hes clearl y the WR behind Toomer but when this offense is clicking the guy has definite value Keep an eye on Hilliards return but he could be a nice sub if you re in a pinch WR Willie Jackson NO Jackson is looking less fluky with each g ame He put together a nice day Sunday with catches for yards Like Jurevicius hes the clear cut receiver but hes certainly valua ble QB Aaron Brooks has surprised everyone and Jackson should continue to benefit WR R Jay Soward Jac Ill be honest I really dont like Soward much but you cant dismiss the fact Mark Brunell seemed to almost be forcing the ball to him on the long throws Hell draw the weaker coverage and rightly so when Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are in the lineup so he could have some mismatches TEs Moving Up TE Freddie Jones SD Jones is still under the radar of a few owners as he plays for the Chargers Truth is hes one of the better receivers i n the game and definitely the best receiver in San Diego Hes a nice big tar get with soft hands for new QB Ryan Leaf Hes had receptions over the last games TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersmas returning to the player we knew he could be With receptions for yards Sunday hes a vital part of the offense With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel not doing much it s pretty much Eric Moulds and Reimersma TE David LaFluer Dal With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained knee LaFlu er seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with catches f or yards and a TD Keep an eye on Harris but this could be a trend TE Anthony Becht NYJ Becht earns the upgrade just for the beautiful diving TD catch Sunday At this point in the season rookies arent re ally rookies any more as most have enough experience that theyre learning t he ropes Becht appears to be a fast learner and could give this team a huge boost with solid TE play QBs Moving Down QB Jeff George Was Audition time is over Didnt you have the feeling owner Danny Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild befor e Brad Johnson sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year i f they ever do that Instead he looked very average and even a little bit old Brad Johnson will get the start this week You never know with knee injuries so George certainly still has value just nothing like he did as a starter QB Trent Green StL Chris Berman made a great point last night on ESPN s Prime Time Trent Green is a nice player but lets forget this talk ab out him being the same player as Kurt Warner Another loss for the Rams pretty much guaranteed well see Warner this week The Rams are sudden ly fighting for their lives and it wont be Green behind center QB Shane Matthews Chi The University of Florida has a great program an d always places a large number of players at the next level but Matthews loo ks to be another shot putting QB that simply cant deliver the ball at thi s level Its a testament to coach Steve Spurrier that he can devise sys tems to make guys like Matthews and Danny Wuerffel look great in college becaus e they clearly lack the talent Put it this way Matthews has Bears fan wishing Cade McNown will get back soon QB Drew Bledsoe NE Whether its the thumb or the WRs or the play calling Bledsoe is struggling I used to blame this on Bill Belichick coming up with a Jets defense that shattered Bledsoes confidence and t hrew him into a tailspin this time of year but now Ill have to start lookin g for other theories As Terry Glenn said it felt like the defense knew exactly what we were going to do Thats bad for a Thursday game RBs Moving Down RB Emmitt Smith Dal As you probably saw Emmitt was knocked out for a moment during the Thanksgiving Day game Check his status this week Ev en he faces a tough stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa Bay Washington New York Giants and Tennessee RB JJ Johnson Mia Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early indicatio ns are that Lamar Smith will be ready to play this week and that means Johnso n takes a seat RB Jamal Anderson Atl It looks to me like the Falcons are very close t o packing it in He may be worth one more start against the porous Seattle defense this week but after that hes got a bye and then New Orleans RB Marshall Faulk StL Understand hes still a top RB but I think h is value is clearly falling a bit He looks less than but the most telling indicator by far was the Robert Holcombe goalline carry weeks ago no way does Holcombe get that carry Hes still a must start and Warner will likely help his stock but Im a little worried RB Curtis Martin NYJ The weather conditions made it tough to get a tru e picture of Martins health but it was pretty easy to see he wasnt Sunday Between Bernie Parmalee and Richie Anderson coach Al Groh has plenty of options and he doesnt hesitate to go with them RB Jermaine Fazande SD The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher and look s to have lost his starting job Not a huge loss as I doubt you were counti ng on him for too much anyway WRs Moving Down WR Yancey Thigpen Ten Drop this guy if you havent already He mis ses games with a myriad of injuries and when he does see the field he manages to drop key passes WR Marcus Robinson Chi One has to wonder what could have been with Jim Miller healthy Shane Matthews managed to get the ball to his best WR a whopping one time Sunday That will not do WR Sylvester Morris KC Morris has been especially disappointing as one usually expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be going the other way Over the last weeks he ranks as the WR in my TD Performance system Part of that can be attributed to Elvis Grbac Warren Moon but hes not playing well right now WR Terance Mathis Atl Mathis ranks among WRs over the last game s in my TD Performance system Thats not what youre looking for fr om a WR even if it is the Falcons Eagle WRs These guys are just not very good I had especially high hopes for Charles Johnson this year but hes not getting it done WR Wayne Chrebet NYJ As sick as I was of Keyshawn Johnson whining abou t Chrebet not being a WR it looks he may have had a point Chrebet just doesnt have the speed or physical size to make a consistent impact w hen defenses choose to take him out of the game I love the guy and admire his grit and determination but he struggles against double coverage And most WR face double coverage TEs Moving Down TE Andrew Glover NO A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats but nobody told Glover about that little axiom The Saints continue to roll in spite of a virtually non existent TE TE Jackie Harris Dal Keep an eye on Harris as he sprained a knee Sunda y and gave way to David LaFluer catching a ton of passes TE Ricky Dudley Oak Hes maybe the most frustrating player in the g ame As soon as you bench him hell catch TDs but I dont know how man y more reception days I can take from this guy To

Thats something to be prou d of You have to be a little bit lucky to get this far but dont hesitate to pat yourself on the back as skill plays a huge part Judging from the emails tons of you are still in mix Dont forget about our Wall of Champions feature where well showcase league winners Stay tuned for mor e details Its crunch time so lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head down the final weekend for many teams identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference betweendominating your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in the money As we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what wer e talking about is players that are moving In other words a player like T E Ricky Dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough t o be a starter in your league It just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make t he upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs I ts all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Jeff Garcia SF Cheatsheetsnet Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to roll No coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this we ek QB Donovan McNabb Phi Mixed emotions here as Ive been hyping McNabb fo r weeks as the guy carrying the Eagles offense But seeing him on my opponents roster in the FanEx playoffs yesterday was less than heartening throwing for TDs and yards Just be aware the Eagles are off this week and wont return till week QB Jon Kitna Sea Like Mike Holmgren maybe Ive been too critical of Kitna He continues to play well and while it likely wont be in Seattle he looks like a starter for some team in QB Aaron Brooks NO A telling mark of a great QB is how he performs when he comes with less than his A game Brooks looked much less in synch Sunday and clearly struggled at times making a few bad throws and missing open receivers Yet he hung in and still posted outstanding numbers His rushing yards quietly add to the points Hes a player Im starting him with few reservations QB Kerry Collins NYG You have to believe his confidence is sky high H e obviously benefited from the return of Ike Hilliard who looked very good This team is looking very tough and very balanced right now The running game is just good enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so dominant that it hurts the QB QB Mark Brunell Jac Its really weird When the hype finally subsides about this guy he starts delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype Go figure QB Kurt Warner StL This may have been the greatest QB performance in th e history of the league without scoring a TD The guy was incredible completing of his passes of Completing with an average pa ss of yards is sick The TDs will come as Warner looked as good as Ive ever seen him placing the ball perfectly and directing his offense QB Ray Lucas NYJ Keep an eye on Vinnies groin Better yet watch the injury reports for news on Vinnies groin Thats better We should know more soon but if its serious Lucas will get the start RBs Moving Up RB Marshall Faulk StL I know you dont need me to list him here but it s worth noting I think he may be the best player in the league right now Martz fed him the ball times and he delivered RB Eddie George Ten George showed outstanding pass receiving skills and added receiving TDs to go with his rushing TD He reinjured his sore to e but looks to be ok Keep an eye on it though RB Fred Taylor Jac What a shocker Taylor runs wild again as we predicted He did tweak a knee so watch that but if he can go full speed hes a no brainer starter against just about anyone RB James Allen Chi If departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was dead dont get excited Bears fans hes not hed be spinning in his gra ve to see Allen garner carries Sunday Be a little leery though as a ypc carry average only works when you carry the ball a ton RB Travis Prentice Cle After fading badly Prentice comes roaring back with a TD performance He only had yards on attempts but the TDs are huge The Brown offense featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson occasionally at QB but they looked much better RB Mike Anderson Den What else can you say The Denver OL is having another Pro Bowl season Anderson is a must start vs any team right now RB Ahman Green GB Im very nervous if Im Dorsey Levens right now Greens been an offensive stalwart carrying the load week after week Everyone always knew he had the potential to be this good but now hes delivering RB Emmitt Smith Dal As was mentioned on the broadcast yesterday Someo ne forgot to tell the Redskins this game is a rivalry You know the Cowboys and Emmitt in particular had to enjoy humiliating the Redskins It would be a bold move even for him but I wouldnt be surprised in the least to see Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie before his obligatory three games are up RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes me look bad for dissing him this Summer Against the Cardinals this wee k he has the chance to be even better RB Warrick Dunn TB If Dunn had any help the Bucs would scary Right now hes doing it all by himself Which probably isnt a bad thing for Dunn owners RB Tony Richardson KC Richardson netted ypc on carries Donnell Bennett looks to have cartilage damage to his knee so Richardsons workloa d should increase Its a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther Cunningham to give Richardson more looks RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka Car Dont hold your breath but Biakabutuka is making noises about returning to the lineup this week Well see RB Terry Allen NO In a lesser version of Denvers OL it appears most anyone can run effectively behind these guys Allen looked rejuvenated Sunday and should only get better as he gets familiar with the system RB Chris Warren Phi Remember that hes off this week but if your league runs through week he could be a factor WRs Moving Up WR Sean Dawkins Sea Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong numbers As is Jon Kitna Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could continue his roll WR Torrance Small Charles Johnson Phi Look what QB Donovan McNabb can do when his WRs decide to show up If they can continue to play well thi s team could be scary Remember theyre off this week but return in week WR Amani Toomer NYG Of the resurging Giants Toomers leading the charge Hes making plays all over the field and even had a nice run agai n WR Terrell Owens SF The scary part is he could have been even better th an the yard TD performance Sunday He looked very good coming back from the toe injury and should only get better The ers are trying to nail down their WR corps for and Owens is making a statement WR Ed McCaffrey Den Its easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod Smith but the truth of the matter is that theyre both excellent WRs I love McCaffrey and his th grade shoulder pads Hes the antiEric Dickerson when it comes to pads or lack thereof Easy Ed goes with prett y much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder pads and thats it Oh yeah hes al so a great WR WR Darrell Jackson Sea Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and delivered I see few reasons why he wont continue to shine WR Torry Holt StL Its tough to predict which Ram WR will catch the passes from Warner but as I said several weeks ago Holt may be the best W R on the team And thats no sleight to Isaac Bruce Holts that good WR Terry Glenn NE Glenns putting together one of his most complete seasons And Bledsoes continuing to play pretty good football which help s WR Willie Jackson NO catch TD You gotta like a guy who gets rig ht to the point Joe Horn is the clear threat but Jackson is a serious option too WR Germane Crowell Det This didnt look like a guy returning from a broken leg He should continue to get better as he becomes more involved in the flow of things WR Bobby Shaw Pit It seems hard to believe but Bobby Shaw is a legitimate starter in many leagues Hes getting lots of looks and the Steeler are throwing the ball WR Ike Hilliard NYG Hilliard looked well rested as he roared back onto the scene An sprained knee suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa se Hilliards playing time even further WR Donald Hayes Car Hayes looked better as expected and turned in a nic e game catching passes for yards The Panthers need to remain focused but if they can Hayes could contribute TEs Moving Up TE Johnny McWilliams Min McWilliams again was active catching passes for yards I like any receiver on this team TE Andrew Glover NO Glovers starting to become a very integral part of the New Orleans passing game Its hard to imagine this team losing RickyWilliams Jeff Blake and Cam Cleeland TE Kris Mangum Car Hes no Wesley Walls but hes more than adequate TE Greg Clark SF He only had yards but the receptions were a nice bonus QBs Moving Down QB Scott Mitchell Cin The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the guy we remembered This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential QB Jeff George Was Ive gotta say Im really surprised George didnt post some great numbers Albert Connell isnt nearly as good as he thinks he is and that may be part of the problem QB Steve Beuerlein Car Its clear to everyone that was a career year Hes still subject to a great game here and there but hes just too streaky to lean very heavily on QB Shaun King TB This guy just isnt very good QB Charlie Batch Det Ive never been a big Charlie Batch fan although hes certainly had his days He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and possibly losing Herman Moore wont help Although German Crowell is back QB Troy Aikman Dal I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve Young a call A sore back is one thing Not remembering your kids names is an entirely different matter Its not worth it Guy QB Ryan Leaf SD Part of it was Baltimore A large part of it was Leaf QB Jay Fiedler Mia Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non throwing shoulder The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely whether itll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB QB Vinnie Testeverde NYJ Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may not be serious Hes not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this one RBs Moving Down RB Ron Dayne NYG Its just hard to get excited about starting this guy as hes such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan Hes always liable to grab that short yardage TD but you just dont know when or where theyll happen RB Jerald Moore FA Things change quickly in this league A few weeks ago Moore looked to be the RB Now hes unemployed RB Darnell Autry Phi Id expect that Chris Warren will cut into his time when they return RB Jamel White Cle Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched this week RB Brad Hoover Car He came back to reality this week On top of that it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to t ry and return this week WRs Moving Down WR Herman Moore Det Moore suffereda neck stinger Sunday He could likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good returning from his injury WR Tai Streets SF Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action a s the ers tried to see what they had for but with the return of Terrel l Owens it looks like Streets will be limited WR Courtney Hawkins Pit Hes losing time to Bobby Shaw The Steeler W Rs seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw WR Danny Farmer Cin Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot alongside Peter Warrick but it doesnt look like its going to make any difference WR JJ Stokes SF Like Tai Streets Stokes suffers from the return of Terrell Owens WR Sylvester Morris KC Morris continues his regression which should se nd red flags as owners look towards WR Keyshawn Johnson TB With Shaun King struggling I dont see a brigh t future for Keyshawn ahead He sounds like a politician conceding when he speaks of the team finding its identity in running the ball TEs Moving Down TE Anthony Becht NYJ In the up and down season from Anthony Becht it looks like hes headed down a bit The injury to Testeverde affects his stock in a negative way TE Tony McGee Cin Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he suffered a broken ankle TE Jeff Thomason Phi Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the primary TE TE David LaFluer Dal Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Joe Lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head dow n the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Gus Frerotte Den You have to love Frerotte stepping in and performin g like he did Of course when you throw the ball times good things oft en happen When you throw the ball times with a completion percentage great things happen Look for more of the same QB Kerry Collins NYG The Giants may be struggling but Collins continues to put up excellent Fantasy Football numbers With guys like Kurt Warner and Daunte Culpepper its easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs come from great teams Not always the case as Collins is showing Often times its teams with vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco that provides the QB motivation to play catchup Collins looks comfortab le in the pocket and if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard healthy for four quarters who knows what might happen QB Brett Favre GB Hes baaaaack I said last week that Favre coming ba ck on the bad foot would be storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an d Favre delivered TDs and yards have the Packers riding high and believing they canmake some noise WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an excellent WR and RB Ahman Green is filling the void left by Dorsey Levens QB Aaron Brooks NO I may be in the minority imagine that but I was very impressed with Brooks taking over for Jeff Blake He was not a QB like Jim Miller in Chicago that knew hed be inserted any minute Brooks was thrust into the game and responded very nicely Hes skinny at b ut tall Big league arm and nice mobility Of particular note was hi s tendency to throw to WR Willie Jackson Well see if that continues Sur e hes a long shot but if youre desperate for a QB he could be a nice surprise QB Ryan Leaf SD Hold the presses Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade list Seriously hes an easy target and Ill admit to taking my share of shots but you cant deny the guy has skills Yes there were some fluky plays with Crockett injuring himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw although the TDs on completions did make for a wild looking box scor e for Leaf Hes got some weapons in Jeff Graham Curtis Conway and his bes t receiver TE Freddie Jones Hes as flaky as they come but he might be worth a look if youre dying at QB RBs Moving Up RB Fred Taylor Jac Taylor put together one of the best performances of the year Sunday night The fact that he did it against the very tough rus h defense of the Steelers makes it even all the more impressive This isnt like rolling up yards on the Cowboys or Cardinals Clearly theres reason for huge hope as if he can do this against Pittsburgh he can do it against anyone RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis ran hard Hes got to be consider ed one of the better RBs in the game right now I still worry about how durable hell be but hes looked great lately averaging yards per carr y Sunday for yards If it werent for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin g a TD here and there hed be even higher RB Darnell Autry Phi Autry refuses to hand over the RB job to Stanle y Pritchett or anyone else Hes not very flashy but he gets the job done both rushing and receiving The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in the standings and Autry figures to be a large part of that success RB Ahman Green GB Id be a little worried right now if I were Dorsey Levens Green averaged yards per carry Sunday as he rolled up tot al yards Most importantly was his number of fumbles Zero No ones ever doubted his incredible physical skills but now he seems to be bringing th e mental game to go with it RB Mike Anderson Den I hate to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea t impression of Isaac Bruces maddening on again off again season As you know Davis missed another game and once again Anderson stepped in nicely By now you know its tough to predict what Davis is going to do each week so it looks to me as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons yards per carry reminded many of h is season Hes running with power and speed and finally appears to be over the knee injury I think hes been over it physically for a while no w but it seems hes handling the mental aspect too WRs Moving Up WR Willie Jackson NO New QB Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson responded well with catches and yards including TDs Often times youll see a backup QB favor the backup WRs as theyre familiar with them Well see if this continues I m guessing Brooks will get comfortable throwing to Joe Horn this week but Jackson is still definitely worth a shot WR Joe Jurevicius NYG As I mentioned above QB Kerry Collins is playing very well With Ike Hilliard set to miss some time Jurevicius should get a chance to show what he can do Hes long been a Fantasy Football tease showing flashes but never really having the opportunity for playing time Lets see what he can do WR Terry Glenn NE Ive beenhigh on Glenn since June He made me look good early on but had cooled midseason Hes now back warming up again an d for you Glenn owners your patience is paying off QB Drew Bledsoe didnt have a TD but he did roll up the yards Once again Glenn was the prime target WR Jimmy Smith Jac Smith looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as the Jags awakened their offenseSunday night Smith seems back in synch with QB Mark Brunell and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game There may not be enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug h for Smith WR James McNight Dal Yes hes a long shot considering the horrid play of Troy Aikman Sunday but you have to like a WR whos getting a ton of looks And McNights getting those looks from Aikman Cant make plays without t he ball TEs Moving Up TE Jay Reimersma Buf Weve been waiting for Reimersma to return to form and he looks to be on his way He was heavily involved and seemed comfortable with new QB Rob Johnson He can be a vital part of the offense and you have to think Johnson will continue to utilize him TE Kris Mangum Car Mangums no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a nice target catches for yards is an improvement from what theyve h ad at TE and it looks like hes back and healthy now Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Steve Beuerlein Car Theres only so much a QB can do by himself He lost Wesley Walls a couple of weeks ago I thought Beuerlein could handle losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur y proved too much His OL is less than stellar and hes just not having muc h time to throw QB Shaun King TB King swings back toward the side of mediocrity after a yard passing effort against Chicago It looked that bad too Even for a Les Steckel Offense Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a positive as teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson QB Steve McNair Ten Not all the turnovers Sunday were McNairs fault bu t he certainly had a hand in them His problem remains a lack of healthy WR s and a stellar RB in Eddie George who can carry the load Last year it wa s McNair vulturing TDs from George but it doesnt seem to be a problem this year QB Jake Plummer Ari If youre a regular reader you know Im not a Plummer fan Im especially not a fan now that hes hurt as well He may get back soon but it wont matter for this team thats in shambles offensively RBs Moving Down RB Thomas Jones Ari Jones was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but still you like to see a better yards per carry average than negative RB Kevin Faulk NE Either Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is not a very good football player How else do you explain Faulk earning on e carry while his RB partner JR Redmond was inactive Patrick Pass got th e bulk of the work but was ineffective Im guessing its the fumbling tha t earned his spot in the doghouse RB Ron Dayne NYG As weve said so often in the past Ron Daynes productivity is tied directly to how well the Giants are playing If New York is leading youll see Dayne If theyre trailing its the Tiki Barber show Lately its been more Tiki than Dayne And if the Giants dont make some improvements on defense I dont see that changing RB Travis Prentice Cle Prentice got folks excited early in the year but hes been disappointing of late Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit e and that doesnt look to change anytime soon WRs Moving Down WR Marcus Robinson Chi Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it appears the QB rotation is affecting his play With Shane Matthews starting Robinson had receptions for yards While those numbers are certainly not horrible theyre not quite what we expect from Marcus He could improve with another week of practice but Im a little concerned rig ht now WR Joe Horn NO As I mentioned above I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but there is no way that hes anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff Blake Of special worry was the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable throwing the ball to Willie Jackson WR Donald HayesCar Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu s for next week is uncertain Hes a vital part of the offense and will be missed if he cant go WR Wayne Chrebet NYJ As the Jets have struggled so has Chrebet He turned in another small game Sunday with yards on catches These numbers just wont get it done for a WR WR Ike Hilliard NYG weeks ago it was Amani Toomer taking the hard shot Last week it was Hilliard with the highlight hit He looks like he may miss a game or two which is bad news for Hilliard owners but good news of Joe Jurevicius owners TEs Moving Down TE Reggie Kelly Atl Kellys just too up and down to rely on to any degree When hes featured in the gameplan hesa nice player and can be effective Its just that its so hard to guess what game that will be TE Anthony Becht NYJ Another Jet receiver thats struggling Becht is frustrating as hell show some nice flashes and then disappear for long stretches Im afraid to say hes starting to look likea Jets TE To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Tennessees Eddie George vs Brown Defense Assuming Eddie George can g et his injured toe healthy and I think he can he could have a monster game against a Brown Defense thats been terrible against the rush For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Th e Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the Ravens and I expect George to take out some frustrations on the Browns Miamis Lamar Smith vs Jets Defense Youll have to look awfully ha rd to find a hotter RB than Lamar Smith In their week matchup he ran for TDs and yards At the time it seemed like a fluke but Smith has maintained almost that pace since then Jay Fiedler and the passing game provide just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does the rest Over the last four weeks the Jets rank in rushing yards allowed per game New York Giants Ron Dayne Tiki Barber vs Lion Defense As you know by now the Giants running game is governed by how close they keep the game Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground game especially Ron Daynes role when the Giants start to trail Against a less than explosive Lions team the Giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of th e way Detroits been weak defending the run over the last four weeks wh ere they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Indianapolis Edgerrin James vs Packer Defense Green Bays allowin g yards rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them Jam es should continue to roll this week against a Packer Defense thats missi ng LB Brian Williams whos out with a knee injury DE Vonnie Holiday may be limited but he looks like hell play and thats some concern but I st ill look for James to romp Baltimores Jamal Lewis vs Cowboy Defense The Cowboys gave up their yard rushing days to quick slasher RBs Charlie Garner and Duce Staley but I m guessing power running Jamal Lewis whos almost as quick as those gu ys will be a great play against Dallas For the season Dallas ranks i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Look for him to catch the ball out of the backfield as well Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense San Diegos Terrell Fletcher Jermaine Fazande vs Bronco Defense Ov er the last four week Denver ranks in rushing yards allowed per game This game smells a lot like the Denver Bengal game to me Winless team comes into town with a big power back and nothing to lose We all rememb er Corey Dillons record setting day and many remember Jermaine Fazande s big day rushing in the last game of against the Broncos Terrell Fletcher is working his way into the mix and thats really muddying the waters Keep an eye on this one and if it looks like one of these guys will garner the bulk of the carries he could be worth a flyer Philadelphias Stanley Pritchett Darnell Autry vs Cardinal Defense T he Arizona defense remains pretty weak against the rush They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB The trick is determining which Eagle RB will get the carries I like Pritchett becaus e hes bigger and can bull doze his way through the Cards Ive been d own on Autry as I believe youre supposed to have the acting careerafter the football career not the other way around Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Eagle Defense Watch this one closely as Pittman is struggling to get healthy with bruised ribs If he can go I like the matchup this week Philadelphia ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Theyre stronger over the ye ar where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Thoma s Jones is in worse shape with pneumonia so Pittman has incentive to get out there Buffalos Sammy Morris Shawn Bryson vs Chief Defense Morris battli ng a bad ankle and looks to be a game time decision Bryson is plenty capable i f he cant go The Chiefs are an attractive matchup as they rank i n rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks They rank i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB for the year Watch this one closely to see if the Bills offer hints to wholl theyll go with Green Bays Ahman Green vs Colt Defense With Dorsey Levens out again Green will be asked to carry the load The Colts are vulnerable to the rus h ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks If Brett Favre can play thatll be a nice boost for Green as the defense wont be able to key on stopping the ground game Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Patriot Defense How much would you rely on Scot Mitchell if you were Dick LeBeau Me neither Whether its Aki li Smith or Scott Mitchell under center its still the Corey Dillon Show New England has shown itself to vulnerable against the rush ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Dillon knows he needs to carry the team and hell do his best His success will depen d on how effect Mitchell can be in drawing the defenses attention toward th e passing game Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way San Franciscos Charlie Garner vs Falcon Defense Charlie Garner continues his great season against a Falcon team thats playing better r ush defense than it had been For the year Atlanta ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB but over the last four weeks they rate in rushing yards allowed per game If theyre without WR Terrell Owe ns again Garner will be asked to carry a little more of the load something h e s gladly done all year Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Jaguar Defense With the WR shuffling go ing on in Pittsburgh I think Bettis is really the only Steeler worthy of starting in most leagues Hes a solid performer though that should h ave another good day grinding the ball out Jacksonville ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they ran k in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Itll be power foo tball as the Steeler just line up and try to run over the Jaguars New Englands JR Redmond Kevin Faulk vs Bengal Defense The Bengal s are tough to predict For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yar ds allowed per game and for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB But they absolutely shut down RB Emmitt Smith last week I look for Redmond and Faulk to have moderate success against this improving unit Redmond is questionable with ribs so keep an eye on this one Chicagos James Allen vs Buccaneer Defense As with the pass defense Tampa Bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing per game For the year they rate in Fantasy Points allowed to th e opposing RBs so its not like theyre invincible With Shane Matthew s behind center and scaring no one though it could be a long day Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Ram Defense As is so often the case th e Redskins could be forced to abandon their running game if the Rams jump out early Washington would dearly love to establish Stephen Davis on the ground but they may not be able to if theyre forced to play catchup The Rams rate over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they check in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Even with Bud Carson helping coach the defense they can be run upon Atlantas Jamal Anderson vs er Defense Jamal Anderson continues to make solid improvement and he seems close to his form to me Hell face a er Defense that can definitely be run on Over the last four weeks th ey rate in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Not unlike the situation wit h Washington the running backs success largely hinges on the ability of the defense to hang tough Anderson can be taken out of the game if the Falco ns cant hold Jeff Garcia and company down in the passing game Minnesotas Robert Smith vs Panther Defense Ive said for years I d love to see Robert Smith play a full season and now were seeing that could loo k like Hes having a great year and I think hell continue to have s uccess against Carolina Theyve been pretty strong lately against the rush ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks bu t for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB If the Vikings can control Carolinas Steve Beuerlein no small feat itll help Smiths chances immensely Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Jacksonvilles Fred Taylor vs Steeler Defense Fred Taylor is beginnin g to work his way out most Fantasy GMs dog house as he continues to be a br ight spot on a team without many bright spots Hes been running hard but this will be a real gut check for him as he squares off against a very tough Steeler rush defense thats only allowed TDs over the last four games Pittsburgh ranks for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposin g RB and Taylor will have his hands full Carolinas Tshimanga Biakubutuka vs Viking Defense Biakabutuka remain s very questionable with a bad toe and the Panthers dont sound very optimistic about him playing Sunday Keep an eye on it as he was able to play through the pain last week Although it seems to be worse this week than last If he cant go youll see undrafted rookie FB Brad Hoov er get the start Dont ask me how that happens Minnesota is decent against the run ranking over the last four games in rushing yards allowed per gam e and for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Bear Defense Most people including myself thought new offensive coordinator Les Steckel would invol ve Mike Alstott more in Frank Wycheck type roles Hasnt happened yet bu t it ll be interesting to see if they start getting the big guy the balls in creative ways Im sure his fumbling problems are still a huge concern but of course thats not something a guy like Tony Dungy talks very publicl y about The Bears are decent against the run ranking over the last fou r weeks in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they check in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Denvers Terrell Davis vs Charger Defense Davis scared everyone this week when it was reported he had a problem with his calf He says its overblown and was calling it just tightness below the knee He ll need to be as healthy as possible this week as the Chargers have been playing stro ng rush defense of late ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over t he last four weeks For the year theyre still ranked in Fantasy Po ints allowed to the opposing RB reflecting some of their earlier struggles Th e Broncos desperately need Davis to shoulder the load with Brian Griese out and itll be interesting to see how he responds Its a tough matc hup but I bet he does well St Louis Justin Watson vs Redskin Defense The good news for Watson is that he doesnt have to worry about Trung Canidate The bad news is Ro bert Holcomb saw a good bit of work at tailback this week and Marshall Faulk is even making noise about playing Monday Faulk did practice some Thursday but coach Mike Martz still remains pessimistic about him seeing much actio n this week Keep an eye on it as Im sure itll be a top story but r ight now he doesnt look to be a big factor The Redskin rush defense is solid ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game and for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Clevelands Travis Prentice Jamel White vs Titan Defense The Brown s catch Tennessee at an awful time as the Titans are coming off a frustratin g loss at home to Baltimore and will likely be looking to vent some frustrations this week Cleveland looks to bear the brunt of that situation Prentice and White have been unexceptional lately and I don t see them improving against a tough Titan Defense Over the last four weeks Tennessee ranks in rushing yards allowed per game They also ra nk for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB These guy s may do in a pinch on other weeks but I dont see it this Sunday Detroits James Stewart vs Giant Defense Stewart is still a starter i n many leagues but I dont like his matchup here Although you can t discount the time he ran wild on Tampa Bay with an awful matchup too The Giants rank for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Thats strong Having a healthy Jason Sehorn back will help the entire defense as it allows more safety help to commit to the run Oaklands Napoleon Kaufman vs Saints Defense Keep an eye on it but a t this point Tyrone Wheatley is looking very questionable with not one but t wo bad ankle sprains His most recent sprain is thought to be worse than th e first sprain on the other ankle that was limiting him already Kaufman struggles a bit as the sole RB and Saints are RB Killers For the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last fo ur games they check in at in rushing yards allowed per game One ray o f hope for Oakland is that DT Norman Hand is questionable with bone chips in his ankle although they believe he can play even though he hasnt pract iced this week Kansas Citys RB committee vs Bills Defense By now you probably know better than to risk starting any RB wearing a Chief uniform This week s a good week to follow that rule as the Bills are playing excellent rush defense They rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game and the rate for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB I shy away from Chief RBs against any team but especially a defense this tough If you dont have any choice Kimble Anders will g et the start but expect to see plenty of Tony Richardson and Frank Mo reau Richardson in particular does a nice job receiving the ball Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Raven Defense Lets put it this way Smit h was shut down by Cincinnati last week And the Ravens are a just a tad bit better than the Bengals when it comes to run defense If anyone can bounce back its Smith but last Sunday was very worrisome The Ravens are f lying high after a huge road win at Tennessee Hes still a solid RB but Smit h will have his hands more than full Sunday The Ravens rank in rushin g yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and for the year they rate in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Dolphin Defense I dont see a repe at of the week meltdown from Miami on defense Martin will have a tough day ahead of him against the Dolphin defense that ranks over the last fou r weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Over the season they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB The Dolphins were hopeful L B Zach Thomas could return but thats not looking too likely now It ll be even tougher for Martin if he does New Orleans Jerald Moore Chad Morton vs Raider Defense New Orleans catches a tough break as the new RBs are forced to make their first start facing the rush defense in rushing yards allowed per game over the las t four weeks For the year theyre not quite as tough ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Its tough to call right no w how the carries will be distributed as the Saints are understandably being tight lipped I expect Moore to carry most of the load to begin with Hes the more physical back and much more like Williams than is Morton who falls closer to the scat back rd down guy mold I can envision somethin g similar to the rotation New England is using with JR Redmond and Kevin Faulk For FF purposes youd of course like to see one guy take over but I dont see that now The other wild card is newly signed Terry Allen wh o sounds excited about football again Well see how quickly he can get comfortable To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

ha ve the Passing Game Matchups in this one and the Rushing Game Matchups will follow Good luck this week Joe Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Passing Game Matchups Heres how I see the matchups this week Please note see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank playersand to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software f or more info The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position numbers are from ESPNcom Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Raider Defense Gut check time for the Sain ts as they deal with life after Ricky Most folks know Im big on synergy which is just one of those words for depending on your teammates Everyone knows that RBs need a decent passing game to be effective on the ground Im beginning to think however that the effect isnt quite as pronounced in reverse In other words I dont believe losing Ricky Williams will hurt QBJeff Blakeas much as losing Jeff Blake would have hu rt Ricky Williams With RBs Chad Morton andJerald Moorein the backfield I look for Blake to air it out against a suspect Raider pass defense Basically like Donovan McNabb is doing in Philadelphia Over the last weeks Oakland ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB WR Joe Hornis by far the favored target while Keith Pooleand Willie Jacksonmay grab a few TE Andrew Gloveris worth a shot if youre in a bind but hes been very inconsistent Atlanta Passing Game vs er Defense The er defense squashed Elvis Grbac owners last week but Im not quite ready to appoint them QB Killer s Theyve been awful for the year up until then Over the last four week s they rank in passing yards allowed per game And they rank for t he year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB QB Chris Chandleris back among us now and the cobwebs seem to be cleared WR Terrance Mathisis by far the best receiving choice although its worth noting th at Shawn Jeffersonhad a great game against this er team back in week doesnt that seem like a long time ago TE Reggie Kellycould be wor th a long shot as the ers rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing TEs although Kelly has done very little of late Minnesota Passing Game vs Panther Defense Im running out of adject ives to describe the stellar play of QB Daunte Culpepper And I think hell keep it rolling this week against a Carolina team that ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Culpepper creates some matchup problems I dont think the Panthers can solve Of course he ll be throwing to the best WR tandem in the game and that never hurts Both Randy Moss and Cris Carterare sure starters in any league Both have a great chance every week of exploding Id even consider WR Matthe w Hatchetteif youre in the gambling mood in a very large league The T Es arent much of a factor here and when they are the receptions are spre ad around Washington Passing Game vs Ram Defense Jeff Georgegets another start i n place of the injured Brad Johnson after a less than earth shaking performance in week vs Arizona yards TD interceptions Fortunately he gets to face a St Louis pass defense thats still givi ng up lots of yards even with Bud Carson helping out They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks And for the year they ra nk in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB As much as the Redski ns would like to control the game with RBStephen Davis you just have to think theyll be forced to throw in order to keep pace with the Rams A bye week should help things WR Albert Connellhas been the source of great frustration for many Fantasy GMs but this should be a good week for him James Thrashis covering the WR job and he might be a good roll of the dice as well TE Stephen Alexanderdoesnt seem to produce the numbers you d think he would in this offense partly because FB Larry Centerscatches so many short passes that might have gone to the TE Carolina Passing Game vs Viking Defense Im looking for a uptick from QB Steve Beuerleinin this one Call it a hunch as he does have some negative s going his way with injuries to his supporting cast RB Tshimanga Biakabutukais iffy FB William Floydis out and center Frank Garcia abrasion to his eye and offensive lineman Matt Campbell thigh contusion also were injured during the New Orleans loss Coach George Seifert is hopeful both can go Sunday On the plus side hes got two physical W Rs in Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad that could give the vulnerable Viking CBs trouble He should have more time to throw this week against a Viking defense thats only recorded sacks in the last games For the year Minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game The TE situatio n is still shaking itself out as Kris Mangum looks to be healthy Only thin g for certain is no one has really stepped in to fill the Wesley Walls void Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Green Bay Passing Game vs Colts Defense First off this assumes Brett Favrecan get healthy If he can I like the matchup against a Colt team that seems to play just good enough to win For the year they rank i n passing yards allowed per game It should be noted theyve played be tter lately though ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Indy seems to jump out early and force the other team to pl ay catchup which they often come close to doing Favres struggled with his RBs his WRs and his own health but this could be a game he surprises He s kind of a storybook guy and this would be a great chapter in the b ook Well see RB Ahman Greengets the start but he must get his fumbling under control WR Antonio Freemanis a likely starter in your league although so rt of like Favre he hasnt produced like many thought he would Bill Schroedercovers the WR and he often sees more passes thrown his way than does Freeman Bubba Franksis coming on at TE and could be a nice play Buffalo Passing Game vs Chief Defense Most folks know Im not a big Rob Johnsonfan but hes got a good matchup this week against a KC defense th ats been awful defending the pass Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB although theres a chance DE Eric Hick s will be back this week after missing time with a bad knee and that will he lp the pass rush he didnt practice Wednesday though Johnson will be throwing to one of the games best WRs in Eric Moulds Not only is Mould s ultra talented but he draws by far the most targets on his team Sharing is great for kids but you like for your Fantasy WRs to be ball hogs Peerless Priceand Jeremy McDanielpick up the scraps RB Sammy Morrisis hobbled so watch that as hes a solid receiver as well TE Jay Reimers mahas been a real disappointment lately although the Chiefs are awful against TEs where they rank just in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE Miami Passing Game vs Jets Defense I dont know if this will be anot her shootout like they had in their matchup earlier this season but the potential for the Dolphins to score some points is definitely there The Jets rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks QB Jay Fiedlershould have plenty of options available as the Dolphins are finally getting WRs healthy Leslie Shepherdand Oronde Gadsdenhave bee n playing well but Tony Martinand OJ McDuffieare now in the mix Hes probably the least physical of the bunch but Ive got a pretty good fee ling for Shepherd here even though he may not start with Martin healthy The smashing success of Lamar Smith is carrying this offense so dont look for too much through the air for Miami Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense QB Shaun Kinglooks to continue t he roll against a Bear team that doesnt know which way its headed T he Bears are decent defending the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per ga me over the last four weeks but for the year they rank in Fantasy Point s allowed to the opposing QB Kings playing with confidence and will l ikely keep focusing on getting the ball to Keyshawn Johnson something I learned from Sporting News Dan Pompei this week about Johnsons num ber As you probably know Receivers have to wear numbers in the s As a Je t rookie all the s were taken so they allowed him to have It wa s such a hit with the fans and NFL Properties chaching that even when a number in the s came available the league granted Johnson an except ion to keep It is a cool number for a WR Ill admit This week Johnso n should continue to have success against a suspect Bear Secondary Jacquez Greenhas really dropped off with Kings new found attraction for Keyshaw n wasnt going near Johnson in that sentence RB Warrick Dunnis a nice threat catching the ball and TE Dave Mooreis a steady performer Philadelphia Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Arizonas offense is in shambles with injuries all around The trouble is these guys werent very good to start with now theyre hurt too What this means is that the Eagles could see lots of offensive action this week if the Cardinals can t do anything when they have the ball Arizona ranks over the last fo ur weeks in passing yards allowed per game But that number will probably worsen if QB Donovan McNabbkeeps throwing the ball times a game as he d id Sunday Philadelphia may be struggling to find a running game but they re making up for it through the air Aeneas Williams is a tough cornerback b ut he cant cover everyone Torrance Smalland Charles Johnsonshould see plenty of action RB Stanley Pritchettcatches the ball very well and I keep thinking TE Chad Lewiswill break out of his slump Indianapolis Passing Game vs Packer Defense Green Bays been pretty t ough of late ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks but for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Peyton Manningsnot a guy wholl go wild for you in the stat column but I like this matchup The Packers have a couple of defensive players either hobbled or out and Manning should have time to throw Thats dangerous WRMarvin Harrisondraws the majority of passe s from Manning and thats just the way we like it Jerome Pathonseems t o have taken the job away from Terrence Wilkins Both Marcus Pollardan d Ken Dilgerare solid TEs and Id feel ok starting either in leagues that required one Of course RB Edgerrin Jamesis a huge asset catching the ba ll out of the backfield Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way New England Passing Game vs Bengal Defense The Bengals are playing harde r for new coach Dick LeBeau but their pass defense and secondary is still fairly porous Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Although for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB This week the health of Drew Bledsoes ri ght thumb is on everyones mind He says hell play and is calling it not an issue Well see Troy Aikman hobbled onto the field last week a nd lit this Bengal team up If Bledsoes healthy he could do even better T erry Glenn and Troy Brown are the prime guys with Glenn still the main target He showed an upswing last week after a few worrisome games He just sign ed a nice contract so lets see if he can start earning it TE Eric Bjor nson fell quickly He was starting a few weeks ago and now hes unemployed Rod Rutledge is the new TE and would be a great pickup if hes available He caught passes last week including a TD Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense Its hard to get too excite d about Kordell Stewartthrowing the ball but this is a decent matchup for him Jacksonville ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Last week they let Seattle roll up the yards and Jon Kitna is hardly Peyton Manning WRs Hines Ward andCourtney Hawkinsare the new starting W R tandem and itll be interesting to see if benching st round underachiev er Plaxico Burressmakes any difference Truthfully youre reaching if y oure digging down for these guys though RB Jerome Bettisis the only viable starter on this offense unless youre in a really big league New York Jets Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense After the Indy loss last week coach Al Groh was giving votes of confidence to Vinny Testeverde Thats usually not a good sign But remember the last time these teams met Vinny went wild with yards passing and TDs Miami recovered nicely from that meltdown and has only allowed TDs in the last games The Dolphins boast two of the best corners in the game in Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain Madison can shut anyone down and Wayne Chrebetwill have his hands full although he had a great game in the first matchup Dedri c Wardis the WR but I like the rookie Laveranues Colesto do some nice things here Worth a shot maybe if youre strapped for WRs Miami has enough faith in theirCBs that they often leave them on the island in man coverage which can lead to a big play TE Anthony Bechtis showing some nice flashes Like Green Bays Bubba Franks it took a little while to get these big guys going Kansas City Passing Game vs Bill Defense Im guessing QB Elvis Grbaccomes out of the chute firing The Chiefs desperately need this game and its clear to see that Grbac winging the football gives this team t he best chance of winning The Bills play a solid pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and ranking i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year TE Tony Gonzalezremains the focal point of the offense although the Bills rank in the league in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year WRs Derrick Alexanderand Sylvester Morrismake a solid tandem and RB Tony Richardsondoes a nice job receiving out of the backfield although you never know what coach Gunther Cunningham will do with his RBs San Diego Passing Game vs Bronco Defense Remember that the Bengals spanked this Denver team so anything can happen This time of year I ge t a fair amount of email from owners with great rosterswho have to decide between QBs like Peyton Manning or Daunte Culpepper Thats great Think about poor Mike Rileyhes got to decide between Jim Harbaughand Ry an Leaf Harbaugh said hes ready to go and is calling his injury a mild hernia He was named the starter early in the week But with Rileys r ock solid management style hes now starting Leaf Im not sure it re ally matters TE Freddie Jonesis the only viable starter on that team but he s pretty darn good ranking in my TD Performance league over the last three weeks Denver ranks just in in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year so he could do some damage here Both QBs will throw to him so it really doesnt matter who gets the nod WRs Curti s Conwayand Jeff Grahamare too inconsistent to get excited about Oakland Passing Game vs Saints Defense Both these teams took a beating last week with the Raiders losing a heartbreaker to Denver and the Saints losing their star RB Ricky Williamsto a broken ankle The Saints have actually been pretty weak on pass defense lately ranking in passing yards allowed per game They are better for the year where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Itll be interesting Q B Rich Gannon will be scrambling and improvising as usual WR Tim Brownis the primary target but James Jettand Andre Risonwill see some action as well Hes up and down but TE Ricky Dudleymight have a chance as New Orleans ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year RB Tyrone Wheatleyis looking very questionable for this week with two sprained ankles which will probably force Gannon to throw more St Louis Passing Game vs Redskin Defense We see it every year it seem s yet so many teams fail to heed the wisdom of acquiring a solid backup QB Both real NFL teams and Fantasy teams need one to be successful Kurt Warner is getting antsy on the sidelines so you know QB Trent Greenwants to shine for another game or two before turning the keys to the car back over Make no mistake Green wants to win for the Rams but he knows hes play ing for a contract Green will be a starter somewhere in and with every TD his negotiating power is strengthened He should fare well even though Washington is a tough defense Partly due to the loss of RB Marshall Faulkwhere Green will likely be forced to the air often as if he needs a reason to pass Faulk made a bit of noise about returning for this g ame and he did practice some Thursday Even if he does play its hard to envision him as a real factor The trouble with St Louis is picking the WR s that will score each week Isaac Bruceand Torry Holtare the two best choices but AzZahir Hakimand Ricky Proehlare not bad options either An d just for good measure TE Roland Williamshas been effective Washington s secondary featuring Deion Sanders Champ Bailey and Darrell Green are a superb unit but theyll have their hands full with St Louis Baltimore Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Dallas shut down the Bengal passing game last week Now thats something to be proud of This week theyll face a rejuvenated Baltimore passing game thats flying high QB Trent Dilferis doing a great Tony Banks impression as coach Brian Billick breathes life into another troubled career His primary target i s TE Shannon Sharpeand I dont think that will change for this week Dal las only ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE so he could blow up For opposing QBs Dallas ranks in Fantasy Points allowed pe r game for the year WRs Qadry Ismailand Patrick Johnsonare decent plays a s well against a secondary that will be without Cheatsheetsnet honorary captain enforcer George Teague whos gone for the year That will be a factor as Teagues a leader on the fieldStill though as poor as the Cowb oy run defense has been youd have to think the Ravens will focus on runn ing the ball with Jamal Lewis Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Chicago Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Lets put it this way T ampa Bay held the Packers to yards passing last week Shane Matthews wil l start for the Bears Ive seen Shane Matthews play and hes no Bre tt Favre Hes not even a Matt Hasselbeck The Bears are in shambles lo sing another gameto Buffalo and losing another starting QB to injury Offensi ve Coordinator Gary Crowton is rumored to be headed to Brigham Young and many fans arent sad to see him talk about going In fact some wish he d stop talking about and just go already This could get ugly for Matthews Although it should be noted the Bucs have a tougher reputation than thei r numbers would support Over the last four weeks they rank just in passing yards allowed per game They rank in in Fantasy Points allow ed to the opposing QB for year Solid numbers but not quite as dominating a s Warren Sapp would have you believe Still though Id shy away from mos t all the Bears this week Id maybe roll the dice on Marcus Robinsoni f you needed a WR but its sketchy at best In fact Matthews seemed to loc k in on Eddie Kennisonlast week instead of Robinson when he was thrust into action Whether this is a real tendency remains to be seen but Id be hesitant to bank on any of these guys too heavily this week Detroit Passing Game vs Giant Defense I have never liked Charlie Batch I think it stems from the fact he looks like Otis Sistrunk but bottom line is Ive never been comfortable with the guy Im getting less comfo rtable with each week it seems Sunday Batch faces a tough Giants defense that has CB Jason Sehorn back They rank over the past four weeks in passing yards allowed per game Sehorn and CB Dave Thomas are both big players who give up very little physically to WRs Johnnie Morton andHerma n Moore Moore seems to be finally waking up Hell likely face Thomas who s not nearly as good as Sehorn TE David Sloanhas a shot as the Giants rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year but ke ep an eye on him as hes questionable hamstring back New York Giant Passing Game vs Lion Defense Detroit may be struggling to throw the ball but theyre doing a pretty good job defending the pass They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks I like QB Kerry Collinsbut hell need some healthy receivers to do anyth ing Ike Hilliardis good to go but both Amani Toomerand Joe Jureviciuswere talking gibberish on the sidelines Sunday after suffering concussions Bo th seem likely to play but you have to wonder how effective theyll be The Lions are much more vulnerable against the run so its conceivable the Giants could go with heavy doses of RBs Ron Daynewith some Tiki Barbermixed in for this one San Francisco Passing Game vs Falcon Defense Im still a huge Jeff G arcia backer but Im not too high on this matchup vs the Falcons Especially with WR Terrell Owenslooking less likely to play as the week progresses The good news is that Jerry Ricelooks to be ok for Sunday Atlanta ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so theyre solid The secondary ranks nd in the league with interceptions They re not as tough for the year though where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Atlanta has sacks in the last games so theyre getting decent pressure on the QB The key as I see it will be developing the running game with Charlie Garner Hes having a great y ear running and receiving the ball Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Cleveland Passing Game vs Titan Defense The worst thing that could hav e happened to the Browns was for the Ravens to spoil the Titans perfect record at home last week Im betting you see a fired up defense this week that could spell doom for QB Doug Pedersonand the Browns Tennessee ran ks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year Pederson s been painful to watch and it wont be any prettier this week WRs Kev in Johnsonand Dennis Northcuttwill see most of the work but Id have a t ough time feeling very good about starting either In fact you can pretty much just skip the Cleveland team this week Cincinnati Passing Game vs Patriot Defense I doubt youre still interested in Fantasy Football in week if you have many Bengals on your roster Heres all you need to know Scott Mitchellvs Bill Belichic k Belichick may have his faults but hes the master at confusing a QB It could get ugly On the flip side theres always that shred of hope Mitchell returns to his form and lights it up But I kinda doubt it Outside of Corey Dillon WR Peter Warrickis the only other possible FF starter on offense Warricks always worth a roll of the dice just for his big play potential Arizona Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This is almost unfair The Cardinals are already one of the worst teams in the league Now they hav e to deal with Center Mike Gruttadauria is done for the year WRs David Bostons hamstring is worse than it was last week when it was bad and Frank Sanders has a serious knee bruise RB Michael Pittmans ribs ar e killing him and Thomas Jones has walking pneumonia Good grief If someone goes to jail and has their wife leave them itll be a Country Western song Unless youre desperate Id avoid all the Cardinal s this week against just about any team Much less the Eagles who are playing very good defense right now Jacksonville Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The above three offenses Cleveland Cincinnati and Arizona make the Slam Dunk list because the offenses are awful The Jags are struggling with injuries still but they land here because the Steelers are playing excellent defense Pittsburgh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year Remember it was against the Steelers when QB Mark Brunell was benched for Jamie Martin back in week Brunell will throw to WR Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell but Im not looking for a lot from either guy The ga me is in Pittsburgh at night and thats a long ways from Jacksonville both in miles and more importantly temperature TE Kyle Brady has calmed down since Jimmy Smith is back healthy although hes a decent play against a tough defense Dallas Passing Game vsRaven Defense Troy Aikman will find the going tougher this week against a fired up Raven team than he did against the Bengals last week Baltimore ranks for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Over the last four games they rate in passing yards allowed per game Aikman will look for James McNight and Jason Tucker man that sounds weird but dont expect the same success you saw last week from these guys In case you were wondering Baltimore is also ranked in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year so Jackie Harris and David LaFluer dont look good either Tennessee Passing Game vsBrown Defense One of the cornerstone principles of Fantasy Football is you have to understand that the numbers rule It s easy to look at the Browns and dismiss them as awful but in certain areas such as pass defense theyre very good in the numbers department For the year Cleveland ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Over the last four games they rank in passing yards allowed per game The reasons for doing so are different but theyre putting up pass defe nse numbers very similar to what the Ravens are posting In Clevelands c ase teams are choosing to run the ball against their vulnerable rush defense Why risk a pass when the defense is begging to be run over QB Steve McNa ir will be looking to WRs Derrick Mason and Chris Sanders Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen could play but youve been burned enough by these guys already TE Frank Wycheck is still the primary receiver although McNair i s spreading the ball around a little more Denver Passing Game vs Charger Defense After a few weeks of flailing about the Chargers are back at the top of the defensive rankings Over th e last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game where th ey faced Miami Seattle and Oakland Granted thats not like shutting dow n St Louis but holding those teams to an average of yards passing per ga me is strong Theyll be facing new QB Gus Frerotte wholl likely tak e a bit to get settled WRs Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith are both solid Denver s still using the TE set with Desmond Clark Dwayne Carswell and Byron Chamberlain all producing I like all the Broncos and I can see them starting in many leagues Im just not too happy about the matchup this week To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Bob Harris from the TFL Report For more info on subscribing check out flashupdatecfm Enjoy Joe lNO MISTAKING WHO IS IN CHARGE OF REDSKINS IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Thursday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEAccording to the Associated Press out of sheer habit Terry Robisk ie almost forgot he was in charge during his first practice as interim coach of the Washington Redskins In fact the man really in charge wasnt there at all Dan Snyder was attending league meetings in New York and wasnt sitting in his usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday If he had been there th e owner would have seen Robiskie do a doubletake to keep from following the same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers under fired coach Norv Turner Today the whistle blew and I started going out with my receivers Robisk ie said And I realized I couldnt I had to go out and stand in the middle of the field and do whatever it is Norvs been out there doing And what did Robiskie do in the middle of the field I did what I usually do Robiskie said with a shrug Talking Robiskie made some changes He eliminated the morning walkthrough so players can rest their legs He simplified the offensive scheme He spent more time on special teams in part because new special teams coach Pat Flaherty is also trying to nail down a new routine Robiskie also said hell have the last word once the whistle blows and t he game begins Otherwise he made it clear that Snyder is the boss A lot of people want to separate us from Mr Snyder Robiskie said Mr Snyder owns the football team I know that I promise you theres very few things in the building Im going to say I want to change without calling h im to say I want to change it The subject arose when earlier in the day when disgruntled quarterback Bra d Johnson said Snyder not Robiskie made the decision to start Jeff George the rest of the season I think that decisions made from up top I think its obvious Johnson said I think Jeffs going to be the starter the rest of the way out In case something happens with him then Ill be ready to go Otherwise Im just going to finish strong up here and deal with my situation in the offseason Robiskie said the decision to go with George was a collective one made by the coaches and Snyder Turner had planned to go with George for this week s game against Dallas Turner was fired Monday a day after a loss to th e New York Giants If I wanted to change my desk Im going to call him and say I want to change my desk Robiskie said If I want to change quarterbacks Im goi ng to call him and say What do you think of me changing quarterbacks Its his football team To try to separate it were wasting our time Snyder was not available for comment His spokesman Karl Swanson said Robiskie makes all football decisions just as Norv did He doesnt need to ask anybodys permission Still Robiskies remarks might make it even harder for the Redskins to lu re a highprofile coach for next season One thing is for sure The quarterba ck who led them to their only playoff appearance since does not plan to return Johnsons relationship with Snyder has been frosty since the owner signed George to a huge contract in the spring and refused to negotiate a new one for Johnson While Turner preferred Johnson George was Snyders chosen catch Johnsons contract expires at the end of the season and he restated his intention to become a free agent I still stand by what I want to do Johnson said We tried to work out stuff a long time ago and it didnt work out on both sides And youve go t to move on The only way the Redskins can keep Johnson from becoming a free agent woul d be to designate him as a franchise player but that would require an upfro nt commitment of about million from a team with almost no salary cap room Johnsons career record as a starter is Georges is Johnson said he would not mind working with Turner again I wouldnt have a problem strapping it up with him again at all under different circumstances Johnson said Norvs a tremendous coach Hes going to go one way and Im going to go another way and you never know where that road leads in the end lSAINTS PK BRIEN ON THIN ICE IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEAccording to Ted Lewis of the New Orleans TimesPicayune this should be a happy time for Saints kicker Doug Brien For the first time since he was a rookie with the eventual Super Bowl champion ers in hes on a team that is zeroing in on a playoff berth But as so often happens to those playing the most precarious position on the team theres a little dark cloud on the horizon Unhappy with Briens misses of fieldgoal attempts in three of his last four games the Saints brought in freeagent kickers Michael Husted and Doug Pelfrey for workouts Tuesday although neither was signed First of all we wanted to see whos out there special teams coach Al Everest said And I would hope it makes Doug aware that he has a responsibility to the team and to himself and that security in this business is success Its the first time in Briens six seasons with the Saints that his job appeared anything less than secure But the working out of Husted and Pelfrey doesnt have him looking over his shoulder any more than he has in the past I was plenty motivated before said Brien who was told about the workouts by Everest on Monday So it doesnt increase my motivation And it doesnt affect my concentration either Theres always a long li ne of guys out there whether theyre here working out or in camp If you dont perform to a certain standard thats what happens By Brien standards he is not having a good year The fifth mostaccurate kicker in league history coming into the season percent is of The six misses are Briens most since when he was of in si x games with the ers and of in eight games with the Saints Since th en the most he has missed has been five Brien the numbertwo kicker from beyond yards in league history befor e this season has been allowed to try only two from that distance a nd both were blocked Ive been struggling a little bit said Brien who took extra kicks in practice Wednesday I havent been hitting the ball as well as I normally do Its very frustrating but at the same time the law of averages plays i n Ive been pretty consistent over the last five years here and I wouldnt say Im doing horribly I just expect to do better and the Saints expect me to be better Its not so much how many kicks Brien has missed but when he has missed them At St Louis he was wide right on a yarder with left that would have given the Saints a point lead Instead they had to sweat out two more possessions by the Rams that could have tied the score And last week against Denver he was wide left on a yarder in the firs t quarter that would have given the Saints the early lead Never mind that h e made three more after that That miss had Saints coach Jim Haslett visibly unhappy on the sideline last Sunday and again on Monday It wasnt the hold Haslett said then It wasnt the snap It wasnt protection He just missed it and it would have been nice to have had those three points But Wednesday Haslett took the unusual step of sitting with Brien at his locker for several minutes after practice engaging in what appeared to be lighthearted encouragement I have confidence in Doug Haslett said I cant get inside kickers heads but Doug will fight through this and everything will be fine Everybody goes through this in a point in their career Maybe so but kickers and punters are the only frontline players who can be replaced on a moments notice even this late in the season Right now kicking field goals and extra points is all Doug does since o ur kickoff guy is Toby Gowin Everest said But we havent seen anybody yet we think is better than Doug To be sure the Saints will bring in two more kickers next Tuesday Jeff Hall and Scott Blanton And to Brien who likes to think of each kick being of equal value no matter the distance or the situation it is a time to strive to do better Ive been pressing a little too much and trying to make things happen he said Im not way far off but it doesnt take too much I dont think Ive ever missed a kick at the end of a game thats cost t he team a game and I dont intend to start now Im doing what I can to get this fixed and just keep plugging along Also of interest ESPNs John Clayton reported that Terry Allen will probably get the start at halfback for the Saints because of the neck injury to Jerald Moore and the sore shoulder of Chad Morton Morton may play on his shoulder but Moore who has had three recent neck stingers probably wont However neither man was included on Fridays list of early inactives Ric ky Williams and Jake Reed were the only offensive skill players on that list As stated in USA Today WR Joe Horn had catches for yards against the Niners the last time the two teams met the thirdbest receiving yards game in club history He needs nine receptions to break the Saints singleseason record for catches in one year Eric Martin holds the team record of Last week Horn became only the fifth receiver in club histo ry to gain receiving yards Martin did it three times According to Pro Football Weekly the first person among a throng of wellwishers to meet Saints QB Aaron Brooks when he got off the plane following the Saints huge Week win in St Louis was an absolutely exuberant Jeff Blake While the Saints injured starting QB didnt travel with the team to the Rams game Blake continues to make his presence felt in a very highprofile and positive manner And finally PFW also advised against becoming too excited Hasletts announcement last week that Williams who underwent ankle surgery November is ahead of schedule in his rehab and could return for the teams regularseason finale vs the Rams Williams was expected to have the cast on his ankle removed late last week But Haslett has a tendency to be overly optimistic in his estimations on his players projected returns following injuries this season and it s hardly a lock Williams will be ready to rumble before a possible appearanc e in the playoffs if even then The report went on to say that while Williams has supposedly been diligently working out at team headquarters riding an exercise bike and lifting weights he has kept an extremely low profile making it hard for sources outside the organization to get a good read on his actual progress MCGINNIS NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PLUMMER IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGETim Tyers of the Arizona Republic reported this morning that Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummers injured ribs didnt allow him to practice on Friday and whether he plays on Sunday at Jacksonville will be determined by a dreaded gameday decision according to head coach Dave McGinnis He hasnt been able to practice for two days and thats not a good sign McGinnis said If hes not ready to go theres no reason to play him I m not going to risk him It makes no sense If Plummer cant go numbertwo quarterback Dave Brown who is still experiencing soreness in the left shoulder he injured in his only start t wo weeks ago against the New York Giants will start But McGinnis also guaranteed that if Brown does start numberthree man Chris Greisen will see extensive action Its the first Ive heard of it Greisen I have to be ready either way Dave will start but he still has that shoulder problem Its not really a problem its a nuisance and I know its hurting him a little bit but he can still play quarterback at a high level I just have to be ready Also of interest McGinnis said he will take three running backs with the team to Jacksonville Michael Pittman hyperextended big toe saw limited duty on Friday but will be available Backup Thomas Jones assumed a larger practice role this week but Clarence Williams is going for added insurance Thomas has been fine the last two days He seems to be getting a lot better McGinnis said And finally The Cardinals released tight end Derek Brown on Monday lNINERS OWENS MISSES FRIDAYS PRACTICE IMAGEWritten By TFL

mean he wont play He had a better week on his turf toe and he may start Sunday against the Saints Running back Garrison Hearst was the only player of interest included on yesterdays list of early inactives Other items of interest Quarterback Jeff Garcia who is ranked third in the latest results of fan balloting for the Pro Bowl would welcome a ticket to Honolulu for the February game If Im able to be selected to represent this team in the Pro Bowl Id definitely be honored and I think it just shows people Ive turned a long way said Garcia who threw for yards and two touchdowns Sunday ers offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg endorsed Garcias Pro Bowl candidacy Jeff threw the football in that game Sunday against San Diego as well as Ive seen him throw Mornhinweg said He was on time He was accurate His decision making was terrific That may be his best ballgame hes played here to date And finally Placekicker Wade Richey isnt afraid to talk about the hot streak hes been on in the past two games He just isnt sure how to expla in the way hes made all six of his fieldgoal attempts which have ranged between and yards Theyve been short kicks but theyve felt good said Richey who had missed four of five attempts before this stretch So far so goodIMAGE lWATTERS TO START VS DENVER IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Friday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE

Denver QB Brian Griese made my Downgrade list in the Upgrades Downgrade article According to John Clayton of ESPN Grieses shoulder injury is a separation of the AC joint in his right clavicle He took a pain killing shot and finished the game Unfortunately his status for this weeks game against San Diego is in doubt At this point coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will be a couple of days before they decide what theyre doing Ive copied the entire story below if youd like more details Sounds like this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket because he could hear the crowd hold its breath is classic Ill keep an eye on it for you as this shakes out Joe From the article nflnewshtml DENVER Brian Griese had a secret Mike Shanahan knew because he was the head coach Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of his right shoulder His teammates didnt know what went on behind closed doors in Mondays dramatic Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium All his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an illadvised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasnt missed The Raiders had an play fieldgoal drive that lasted six minutes Teammates saw Griese trot back to the field warm up and miss only five plays They didnt hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and needed a paindeadening shot to finish the final three quarters This is not a game I wanted to miss and I was going to do anything possible to get in the game and help my team win Griese said I was going to do it It was just the will to play and the will to win and I wasnt going to come out An hour after the game Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran their huddle had a busted wing His performance was John Elwaylike for courage but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese available as a starting quarterback for Sundays game against the San Diego Chargers We wont know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury but hes such a competitor Shanahan said Hes been like that since hes been here He wants to play and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure he doesnt further hurt himself Thats the kind of guy he is Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy Last year was different In the preseason it was supposed to be Bubby Bristers team but Shanahan named Griese the starter Veterans didnt feel totally comfortable with him Griese didnt feel comfortable bossing around a group of players who didnt take to him Brians the one to lead us Smith said I think it would have hurt him more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing with the shoulder the way it was Whatever he does he doesnt surprise me Hes the best quarterback in the NFL I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon is We think Brian is Griese told his offensive players that he didnt have too much zip on the ball They accepted it as just humility I wasnt throwing the ball as well I have been Griese said Some of the balls just died At that point it was just your will to play your will to win I wasnt coming out of the game Griese was of for yards with a separated shoulder Hed throw passes and hear as well as feel his shoulder popping in and out I knew there was something wrong with it but they assured me that I couldnt do any further damage Griese said It was just whether I could handle the pain Being injured didnt make Griese shy away from contact Several times he took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High Stadium grass Once cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the blindside Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high Believe it or not the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I heard the crowd and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that Griese said I said to myself Well somebody must be ready to hit me Talk about homefield advantage Griese has never had an injury like this He has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that requires surgery but this was much more painful Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big play He had to make just an armthrough pass It was agonizing He threw a skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the chin I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I didnt have any zip on the ball Griese said Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different We knew it was something that was hurting him we knew he was banged up fullback Howard Griffith said Thats how it is when youve got a job to do Still the story told after the game amazed them To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

rades Replacing Ricky Williams Contrary to published reports Ricky Williams bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to ESPN The wor d is that Jim Haslett will likely not go outside the team for a back Chad Morton and Jerald Moore will likely be the choices with Morton getting fir st shot Mortons a little undersized at and but so is Sa n Franciscos Charlie Garner and he manages pretty wellMorton came from a big time program at USC and averaged carries a game last year so it s not like he isnt used to carrying the load Well see Dont Count Out Brett Favre According to ESPN Brett Favres foot is much better and he may practice this week Even if he doesnt practice he thinks he may be able to play and keep his record streak of consecutive starts intact Akili Smith Benched Not just benched Benched for Scott Mitchell Tha t s gotta hurt Marshall Faulk Raring to Go With Trung Canidate out for the year with a broken wrist Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may be abl e to play this week Most think thats too optimistic but its nice t o see the desire there Jeff George to StartAccording to the Redskins Jeff George will start again this week at QB Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is BradJohnsons when heshealthy possibly inweek Lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head dow n the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Laveranues Coles may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairl y far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Mark Brunell Jac Im one of those guys who quickly points out Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he receives but you cant deny what Brunell has done lately Behind a beat up line hes standing in there while taking a beating and delivering th e ball Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and paired with Keenan McCardel l theyre one of the better WR tandems in the league QB Kerry Collins NYG A few weeks ago I took some deserved lumps for my early praise of Collins but hes kicking his game up a notch of late He looks more comfortable in the pocket especially in his footwork and drop backs Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing but when hes healthy T oomer and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps Asolid ground game in Ron Dayne a nd Tiki Barber continue to help the passing game QB Donovan McNabb Phi With Deuce Staley gone McNabbs had to shoul der the offense and this week he came through with flying colors The bad ne ws is he only completed of his passes Sunday The good news is he threw t he ball times When a QB airs it out times in one game it doesnt usually bode well for the teams chances of winning but its certain ly a plus for your FF team to see that many attempts With that many chances its like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake attempt s this week or Jeff Garcia attempts puts up Unless you have a really good feeling about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry Id think you ll see him continue to throw often QB Trent Dilfer Bal Remember this list is relative While he may no t be a starter Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and thats what this list is all about He actually looked very good at times in the huge victory over Tennessee Sunday He showed nice poise coming back after basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier Brian Billick did wonders with a marginally talented Tony Banks in and its conceiva ble he might do it here again with Dilfer They play Dallas and Cleveland ne xt but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December QB Troy Aikman Dal When Im bashing Mark Brunell as a Fantasy QB I usually compare him to Troy Aikman Great real NFL QB but not a much f or Fantasy GMs Notice a pattern here After being named the starter Sunda y Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked over t he last weeks Its hard to put too much faith in him but if youre desperate for a QB he could be worth a gamble Tough matchup this week vs Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week QB Jeff Blake NO You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is gone for weeks I hate it for Williams owners Im one but what s done is done All we can do now is look forward And looking forward I see Blake being forced to carry an increased load QB Donovan McNabb threw t he ball times Sunday in the wake of losing RB Deuce Staley and I could easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with Blake throwing a l ot more passes QB Rob Johnson Buf I make it a point to hold my tongue on coaching issues but Ive gotta say I think Mr Charisma with the Spiffy Sweaters Wade Phillips is wrong in going to Johnson In terms of roster management hes hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion But no ne of that really matters as Rob Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he s been named the starter for this week Dont get too excited though Johnson finishes roughly half the games he starts and the next three weeks vs Kansas City Tampa Bay and Miami could be brutal QB Matt Hasselbeck GB Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre this week Remember there was even some talk about trading Favre and starting Hasselbeck this summer when Favres elbow was a big concern Before yo u give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck you should know Brett Favre is reportedly feeling better and hoping to play this week Well keep you posted QB Shane Matthews Cade McNown Chi Again Im highlighting guys mov ing up With the injury to Jim Miller Shane Matthews will be thrust into the starting role The injury will also likely add a little fire under Cade McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have been if Miller was performing well Matthews looked very rusty but its tough to judge a QB when hes thrust into the game like that Id look for Matthews at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then well see RBs Moving Up RB Lamar Smith Mia You have to keep giving this guy his props after another great game Although if youve got an owner salivating over S mith and you can get a lot in return it might be a great time to trade him I cant imagine his value being any higher His yard per carry number d ipped to in Sundays game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal matchup against Tampa Bay in week RB Edgerrin James Ind Its tough to upgrade a guy already near the top but he put in another great game Sunday with total yards and shows little sign of slowing down He averaged yards per carry Sunday and the Colts are leaning heavily on him Watch out for a tough November matchup vs Miami though RB Robert Smith Min Smith quietly is having an incredible year He s put those hang nail injury jokes way behind him as hes become one of t he best RBs in the league Hes running between the tackles for the toug h yards and catching the ball exceptionally well Keep an eye on that tasty week matchup against the Cowboys RB Fred Taylor Jac Jaguar Fans may be distraught but Fred Taylor owne rs have to be happy at least lately Taylors running as well as he has i n his career even if his team is struggling One can only wonder what he d be doing with a healthy supporting cast Hes got two tough weeks coming against Pittsburgh and Tennessee But as everyone knows Taylor has a gre at stretch run of opponents in weeks when he faces Cleveland Arizona a nd Cincinnati RB Jamal Anderson Atl If you didnt know better you might have tho ught you were watching tape from if you saw Anderson Sunday He ran hard a nd with the power and quickness that pushed him to stardom Hopefully he ll be able to maintain that form RB Michael Pittman Ari Pittmans nursing a chest rib injury so ke ep an eye on that but assuming hes ok he has to make the upgrade list He scored a TD Sunday and averaged yards per carry on carries He als o added receptions His main competition for carries Thomas Jones had a yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday RB Justin Watson StL Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed for yards on carries He likely wont be a factor long as Marshall Fau lk is already itching to get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for one more week RB Ahman Green GB With Dorsey Levens troubles Green clearly shoot s up the charts Hes an enormously talented RB but hes got to learn h ow to turn that talent into on the field production After a tough Tampa Bay game last Sunday he faces a soft schedule with the Colts Panthers Bears Lions and Minnesota coming up RB Chad Morton NO With Ricky Williams out for the next weeks the logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC Morton Hes Detroit WR Johnnie Mortons little brother and was reportedly e xtremely close to Ricky Williams and shaken with his injury Hes small but ve ry quick Hes not as big as youd probably like but neither is Charli e Garner Last year at USC he carried a full load as the featured rusher s o hes capable The team hasnt announced their plans yet and bringin g in a free agent is a possibility but Id expect Morton to get a shot first New Orleans has a fairly favorable rushing schedule ahead with Oakland Denver San Francisco and Atlanta all ahead WRs Moving Up WR James McKnight Dal Wow What else can you say but give the man credit catches for yards with a TD is a pretty good day Whether he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you have to lik e what hes done thus far Hes got a brutal matchup next week in Bal timore but he might be worth grabbing to play against the Vikings in week WR Sean Dawkins Sea Excuse us for not getting excited about a guy who was buried on the Seahawks a few weeks ago and had Jon Kitna throwing to him But Kitnas looking better and Dawkins responded with a great gam e Like McKnight the question is whether he can keep it up but hes worth a roll of the dice WR Torry Holt StL I drew a few snickers a month ago when I said I thought Derrick Mason was the best WR on the Titans Im just about rea dy to call Torry Holt the best WR in St Louis And thats no knock on Isaa c Bruce Holts really coming into his own and to be honest benefits gr eatly from the attention Isaac Bruce draws He does face a couple of strong defenses in Washington and New Orleans but Im betting he manages to pr oduce against tough competition WR Derrick Mason Ten Mason is clearly the best WR on the team Partly by default as Kevin Dysons gone and Carl Pickens is injured But partly because hes just that good The Titans had their running game shut d own by Baltimore Sunday and they were forced to the air And much to the surprise of many QB Steve McNair fared pretty well and Mason was a big pa rt of that success WR Ricky Proehl StL Great just what Fantasy GMs need Another Ram WR to worry about Proehl caught passes for yards and a TD Sunday In an offense missing RB Marshall Faulk as high powered as the Rams theres probably room for another WR at the trough WR Patrick Johnson Bal Johnson replaced Travis Taylor in the lineup an d came up big with the game winning TD He only caught passes but understand that hes the rd receiver behind TE Shannon Sharpe and WR Q adry Ismail Still though its a Brian Billick team and Trent Dilfer is pl aying better with each series it seems WR Jimmy Smith Jac With catches for yards I guess you can s ay hes back The Jags may be struggling but Smith and QB Mark Brunell ar e back in synch Ride it while the combo is hot WR Jerome Pathon Ind Terrence Wilkins had a firm grasp on the WR sp ot early in the season but Pathon seems to be taking over there Pathon is playing with more confidence and more importantly seems to have the confidence of QB Peyton Manning He had catches for yards Sunday TEs Moving Up TE Bubba Franks GB For a long while Franks and TE Tyrone Davis had battled for time Its now looking like Franks has prevailed as Davis is seeing very little time Franks made a great catch of the fake kick TD an d is showing some of the athleticism that caught the Packers eye in the draft TE Rod Rutledge NE So much for Eric Bjornson Rutledge seems to be the new TE threat for the Patriots and you know Drew Bledsoe likes to throw to the TE If he can just get that thumb healthy TE Shannon Sharpe Bal After some quiet weeks Sharpe has returned to his place of one of the premier TEs in the game Hes clearly the best receiver on the team and has the confidence of QB Trent Dilfer Just as importantly he seems to have confidence in Dilfer QBs Moving Down QB Trent Green StL Mike Martz said a couple of weeks ago he felt that having Green behind center was just like having Kurt in there We believe him If youre going to deal him nows the time Even as well as hes been playing the league MVP Warner does not lose his job to a broken hand The team is talking about December as a possible date hell be back b ut I ve heard even sooner Regardless you have to figure his days are numbered Plus upcoming games against Washington and New Orleans in the next two weeks could pose a threat QB Doug Flutie Buf Right or wrong Flutie takes a seat as Rob Johnson s been named the starter this week Hold onto him though as Ive got to think the chances of Johnson staying healthy for long are slim QB Drew Bledsoe NE So much for the Boston Globes Bill Belichick conspiracy that Bledsoe would miss several weeks Still though you could clearly see he wasnt with the thumb QB Brett Favre GB As you know Favre suffered a sprained foot against Tampa While everyone was shouting about how many weeks hed miss Fav re told anyone whod listen today that he looked to be ready for this week s game against Indianapolis Players are notoriously optimistic so keep an eye on it QB Elvis Grbac KC Dont get me wrong Grbac is still a top QB He just showed Sunday hes human He really should have done more against San Francisco though On a side note didnt he say hed shave that goo fy beard when they lost QB Brian Griese Den Its the rd quarter of the Monday Night game a s I type this and its pretty obvious Brian Griese is at less than arm strength Keep an eye on this Hes a gutsy kid and has played throu gh a lot but it does seem to be affecting his play QB Charlie Batch DetAnother game another less than impressive performance Batch just seems to struggle to get anything done QB Akili Smith Cin Ive been ripping this guy for weeks and now I fe el sorta bad for him as hes been benchedfor Scott Mitchell Thats gotta hurt QB Jim Miller Chi Talk about blowing an opportunity Miller had been moving the Bears and looked to be the spark Chicago was missing with Cade McNown And then Mr Achilles decided he didnt want to participate Nasty injury and too bad as he was showing promise RBs Moving Down RB Charlie Garner SF Garners been a regular on the upgrade list an d he had another huge game Sunday where he posted total yards with a TD against the Chiefs Two big days loom on the horizon though I promise you hell be shut out in week he has a bye And then he faces San Diego and New Orleans in week and Hes a great player and one of the best RBs in the game but hell be facing some tough matchups coming up RB Ricky Williams NO As I reported yesterday to our email subscribers Ricky Williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss weeks I had to chuckle watching Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett talk about how Ricky doesn t play defense and didnt make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an d about how Rickys just one guy and theyll be fine Yada yada yada That sounds good Jim but youre in for a rude awakening if you really believ e that I dont think he does Chad Morton will be the likely replacemen t Jerald Moore will get a shot too RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka Car yards per carry will not get it done f or a featured RB in this league and thats exactly what Biakabutuka posted Sunday Hes got to get back on track if the Panthers are to be effect ive as a team RB Mike Alstott TB It seems as if Alstott is less of a factor every game He only had rushing attempts Sunday for yards If I were him Id pay Keyshawn to tell the coaches I needed some carries RB Emmitt Smith Dal What a disappointing game vs the Bengals Sunday Smith fumbled early on what should have been a sure TD and never seemed to recover I thought hed carry the load for a struggling Aikman Turne d out the other way around RB Shaun Alexander Sea So much for the idea of coach Mike Holmgren throwing in the towel for and starting the young players like Alexander The rookie is a fine player and will get his time but for now it doesnt seem to be happening anytime soon RB Trung Canidate StL Canidate broke his wrist Sunday and will miss t he rest of the season I have no idea how the Rams will function without him WRs Moving Down WR Marvin Harrison Ind Is it just me or is Marvin Harrison getting mor e and more quiet with each game He only had catches for yards Sunday and didnt seem to be a big factor Hes still one of the best WRs out there but Im worried about his production WR Terry Glenn NE Glenns faded down the stretch and the Bledsoe th umb injury wont help his play one bit Dont be too down on him as he d oes have some favorable matchups on the horizon But if Bledsoe cant go its trouble for Glenn WR Marcus Robinson Chi The loss of QB Jim Miller is huge The Bears ar e now with their QB and you can only expect so much Robinson will make any QB better but theres only so much he can do WR Antonio Freeman GB Freeman appears to be headed toward the path he was on a few weeks ago mediocrity And that was with a healthy Favre With aless than healthyFavre it could be worse WR Jacquez Green TB Keyshawn Johnsons gain is Greens loss as Q B Shaun King seems locked in on Johnson Green will still catch the occasional lo ng ball but it appears for now hes the clear cut WR WR Terrence Wilkins Ind Suddenly Terrence Wilkins is the forgotten ma n in the Colts passing game For some reason Peyton Manning just isnt giving him the looks TEs Moving Down TE Kyle Brady Jac Bradys still a solid TE but with the return of J immy Smith its clear that he wont be the big target he had been TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersma was a total non factor in Sundays g ame catching only pass for yards One has to think the QB shuffle could have an effect TE Itula Mili Sea Milis yielded his starting TE job to Christian F auria and Fauria seems fairly intent on keeping it Mili may be a contributor bu t it looks like he wont see enough action to make him a consistent thre at To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Owens can not go Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens SF took part in about of Fridays practice Coach Steve Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not starting Owens Sunday although it seems likely hell play at least some The amount he could play will be determined by how Owens feels at gametime This is so tough to call as hes one of the elite WRs in the game and of Terrell Owens is better than of lots of other WRs People always want numbers so heres my opinion Chances he doesnt play at all Chances he plays but contributes less than his normal numbers Chances he plays and looks like the Owens weve been seeing Weigh that out for what its worth and make the call that best suits your team and situation Hes a high risk high reward decision this week If youre pretty well set and just need a few points out of your WR slot Id probably bench him and find another guy If you need to swing for the fences Id probably be inclined to gamble on him and keep your fingers crossed WR Derrick Mason Ten is the least hurt of all the receivers and will start on Sunday He is battling a sore back and ankle He practiced on Thursday WR Chris Sanders Ten is listed as questionable on the injury report but expects to start with his sore back and ribs He practiced on Thursday WR Yancey Thigpen Ten shockingly appears on the injury report as questionable this week For those that have followed his career

the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sur e you understand what were talking about is players that are moving In other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Laveranues Coles may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairl y far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or do wn and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Jeff Blake NO Heard a funny thing on ESPNs Monday Night Pregame show The guys said that with the troubles in St Louis the road to the Super Bowl now runs through New Orleans Its been a while since youve been able to say that Blake struggled in the preseason but has become mo re comfortable with each game With a great rushing game featuring Ricky Williams and a star WR in Joe Horn Blakes looking great QB Trent Dilfer Bal Shannon Sharpe predicted that when the Ravens finally scored a TD theyd score a bunch of them The big TE was prophet ic as Dilfer threw for TDs Sunday He scrambled improvised and made excellent decisions A little confidence may be all he needed He doesn t have a stellar WR corps with Qadry Ismail Jermaine Lewis and Patrick Johnson but he does have a great TE in Sharpe and a solid RB in Jamal Lewis QB Brian Griese Den As expected Grieses recent off the field troubl es had little impact to his performance on the field yards and a couple of TDs is strong against a good Jets team The biggest reason for his upgrade though is the smashing return of RB Terrell Davis If Sunday was any indication this offense could make some serious noise QB Shaun King TB With back to back solid games Shaun King is turning some heads He only passed for yards Sunday but squeezed every yard f or all it was worth with TDs He continued to target Keyshawn Johnson even to the point of forcing the ball in places it probably shouldnt have been thrown Its tough to rely on a QB who plays in this conservative offense but if youre thin at QB King might be worth a shot QB Jim Miller Chi Miller clearly gave the Bears a boost with his solid play Sunday Not only was he more accurate than the injured Cade McNown he showed a better arm to boot Millers gain will be McNowns lost and I lo ok for Miller to gain plenty over the next few weeks QB Danny Kanell Atl Kanell came in when Chandler left with a concussion He played pretty well with TDs on yards Chandler look s to possibly miss this weeks game and Kanell could be a nice play against a Detroit Defense RBs Moving Up RB Lamar Smith Mia Hes made this list several times already this yearbut its worth noting how good hes been lately Sundays TD yard day earned him the RB ranking in many scoring systems I dont se e many reasons why he wont have continued success RB Terrell Davis Den In one of the more heartening performances of the day Terrell Davis looked great He showed the power and the burst that weve come to expect from Davis over the years Coach Mike Shanahan said during last weeks practices that Davis looked as good as hed ever seen him After watching the game I have to agree with him RB JR Redmond NE According to coach Bill Belichick and Boston Glob e columnist Frank DellApa Redmond injured his foot during practice and was supposedly going to be limited Sunday Kevin Faulk was unimpressive early and Redmond never looked back after getting a chance Hes productive without being impressive as he only averaged yards per carry on attempts but did get the score RB Jamal Lewis Bal Much had been made of the Ravens troubles but Jamal Lewis had been running hard and effectively Lewis was held out of the endzone once again but he rolled up total yards with rushing and yards receiving If Trent Dilfer and the passing game can keep things rolling I see no reason why Lewis cant hold up his end of the offense RB Justin Watson StL As you know by now Marshall Faulk had knee surger y Monday and will miss weeks Weve had Watson on our Waiver Wire Wonder list for a while as the guy whod get a shot if Faulk went down He was less than impressive yesterday with only yards on carries but he did get the TD Plus coach Mike Martz said the game plan had been designed around Faulk and the skills he brings Look for Watson to perform better with a week to prepare Although Marshall Faulk is the only guy wholl gi ve you Faulk like numbers anytime soon in this offense RB Warrick Dunn Dunn had carries Sunday and he continues to play a bigger role in this offense Its coming at the expense of Mike Alstott It seems strange to see Dunn carry the load but thats exactly what hes been doing After the Minnesota game last week Keyshawn Johnson said he told QB Shaun King that he needed to get the ball to and Johnson and Dunn King evidently listened Makes you wonder whos really coaching this team RB Jermaine Fazande SD Fazande looked to be in danger of losing carrie s last week but he responded Sunday with a nice day carrying the ball tim es for yards ypc He also tacked on yards receiving The Chargers are still struggling but Fazande could be a nice addition if youre thin a t RB WRs Moving Up WR Keyshawn Johnson TB Johnson told QB Shaun King he wanted the ball King obliged and Johnsons made the most of it He only had receptions for yards but he managed TDs on of those catches I dont look for h im to score every other time he touches he ball down the stretch but I do thi nk he could continue the roll You can bet the Bucs wont mess around with whats working for them WR Joe Horn NO Can you imagine if Elvis Grbac still had Joe Horn in KC QB Jeff Blakes certainly glad to have him and Horn surely likes the role of the WR He put together a great game Sunday with yards on receptions WR Keith Poole isnt carrying his share of the load but RB Ricky Williams is more than making up for it St Louis WRs Id look for Isaac Bruce Azzahir Hakim and Torry Holt to all increase their production in the wake of Marshall Faulks injury Synergy can be a strange thing On most teams Id view the loss of the star RB as a negative toward the WRs The Rams have so many passing weapo ns though I think they can carry the team with a lesser RB in the backfield WR Donald Hayes Car Apparently the loss of Wesley Walls can be overcome Hayes made some great plays Sunday Not unlike Keyshawn Johnso n he only caught passes but he made the most of them with yards and a TD He looks to be back on track WR Muhsin Muhammad Car I received a few emails asking how in the world could I continue to rank Muhammad as high as I did last week Hes good thats how Sure the Rams had something to do with his play and the ranking but I like his activity He caught passes for yards Sunday night and should continue to play well WR Derrick Mason Ten I said a few weeks ago that Mason could be the bes t WR on the team Now Im sure of it Of course its a team that doesnt throw the ball very well and when they do throw the TE is the primary target Still though hes a solid contributor and you could certainly do worse at WR His special teams play is a nice bonus if your league lets you double dip the WR and special teams categories WR Laveranues Coles NYJ Coles continues to play great football He ranks as the WR over the last games Keep an eye on him for keeper leagues as his play is very encouraging considering his lack of experience He should only get better WR Marcus Robinson Chi I told you Robinson doesnt seem to care whos throwing the ball and Robinson came through Sunday with yards and a TD New QB Jim Miller definitely gave the Bears a spark and Robinson benefited from it Dont be surprised to see him keep it rolling TEs Moving Up TE Shannon SharpeBal Sharpe led the charge as the Ravens came roaring back Hes clearly the best receiver on the team and you can bet QB Trent Dilfer will continue feeding him the ball TE Ricky Dudley Oak Dudley was a guy who kept raising eyebrows on our weekly cheatsheets Even though he made the downgrade list a couple of times we kept him fairly high on the overall list just based on potential Dudley finally showed some of that potential Sunday with a couple of TDs Its worth noting that he scored TDs in of them came in the second half of the season TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersma seemed less rusty Sunday as he hauled down receptions for yards Flutie will probably get another start th is week and look for him to continue leaning on the big TE Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Donovan McNabbPhi McNabb only completed of his passes Sunday And even for the ones he completed he only averaged yards per completion which is a bad sign He doesnt seem to bemaking the improvements and progression youd like to see from a QB with his experience QB Charlie Batch Det Batch was banged around repeatedly Sunday He eventually left with a concussion and his status for this week will be determined probably by Wednesday Youve probably seen it by now but coa ch Bobby Ross resigned I doubt thatll have too much effect on the offense QB Drew Bledsoe NE Bledsoe suffered a very Brett Favre like banged up thumb as he hit a defenders helmet He was in obvious pain on the sidelines and looked extremely frustrated not being able to play X rays were negative but hes still hampered by it Theyll make a decision on it this week but even if he can go he could be limited QB Chris Chandler Atl Once again Chandler was led off the field lookin g punch drunk It wasnt pretty Danny Kannell actually played pretty well and could get the start this week RBs Moving Down RB Corey Dillon Cin As expected the dream became reality vs a tough Baltimore defense I traded him in my league last week and hope you did t he same Ill say it again a RB can only do so much when there is absolutel y no threat of the QB throwing the ball Akili Smith is world class awful RB Mike Alstott TB As Warrick Dunn becomes a bigger part of the Buc offense Alstott is playing a reduced role Part of the reason is likely his fumbling problems but the effectiveness of Dunn is playing a part Im sure That and Keyshawn said to give it to Dunn RB Kimble Anders KC The featured back in KC had carries Sunday Never ever trust a Kansas City RB No matter what I might tell you in the future dont believe it Theyll break your heart every time RB Travis Prentice Cle Prentice averaged yards per carry Sunday That wont get it done Like a lesser version of Corey Dillon beware RBs with QBs who dont scare anyone throwing the ball Doug Pederson doesnt scare anyone WRs Moving Down WR Johnnie Morton Det Mortons inability to take up the slack for the departed Germane Crowell has been a huge disappointment He came up small again Sunday and one has to wonder what will change in the future WR Herman Moore Det Lets put it this way JJ Stokes is the WR in San Francisco and he had a better day than Moore WR Jacquez Green TB Like Alstott is suffering in the wake of Warrick Dunns success Green is suffering as Keyshawn Johnson commands more attention He only had receptions and simply isnt getting the looks he was earlier in the year WR Raghib Ismail Dal In whats become the uncomfortable norm Dallas ha s lost another WR to knee surgery There was so much promise this Summer wi th Troy Aikman Emmitt Smith Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail Things can change quickly WR Carl Pickens Ten Pickens injured his hamstring again this week I was high on him coming over to the Titans but hes been a non factor Derrick Mason is the best WR on the team By a mile TEs Moving Down TE Chad Lewis Phi After a hot start Lewis has struggled of late as defenses bracket him With no WR to take some heat on the downfield route s its not too hard to shut down the TE Until McNabb and Charles Johnson Torrance Small get going his troubles will likely continue TE Tony McGee Cin McGee should be a nice weapon for the struggling QB Akili Smith but he doesnt seem to be utilizing him as youd expect He caught only passes Sunday The sad part is that almost made him the leading receiver To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Undergo Knee Surgery nflnewshtml From the article St Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove loose cartilage from his right knee an injury that forced him out of Sunday nights loss to the Carolina Panthers Faulk practiced Friday and went out for pregame warmups after having the knee drained earlier Sunday but the knee began to lock on him Coach Mike Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only weeks But teammate DMarco Farr a defensive tackle was out a month with a similar operation He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there Martz said Really there was nothing else to do Justin Watson started in place of Faulk who leads the NFL with yards from scrimmage Faulk suited up for the first half but was wearing sweats after the break Watson scored on a yard run in the third quarter but finished with yards on carries Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season An MRI on Monday also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the loose cartilage My View Coach Mike Martz called him Superman last week as he battled through injuries Apparently hes mortal after all The surgery to remove the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in weeks If you started Faulk dont be kicking yourself There was nothing you or anyone else could have done As of late Sunday afternoon evening he was still the starter You cant control last minute scratches when a player has a problem during pregame warmups All Faulk owners knew he wasnt but we all know hes still one of the best RBs in the game even when dinged up Hindsight is Let it go All you can do is move forward Lets look at it analytically The problem now becomes a matter of timing If Faulk comes back according to schedule hell be ready in week or Most FF leagues play a game regular season with playoffs in weeks and or if your league hasnt wised up yet This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs For Teams that own Faulk As we predicted Justin Watson carried the load for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with yards on carries although he did get the TD Id think hell improve but its obvious Faulk not just the system is the driving force behind his success What Im saying is that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George stepping in Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate if he ever sheds the candybone label or Robert Holcombe A better option might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well right now like Chicagos James Allen Buffalos Sammy Morris or JR Redmond in New England If youve got a playoff spot secured dont panic Grab a lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs keeping your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery If you need a big push just to make the playoffs Id think very hard about dealing Faulk and shoring up your short term needs You have to remember youve got to MAKE the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl For Teams who dont own Faulk The question you must ask yourself is do you have depth somewhere that youd be willing to trade away for Faulk If you seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs it might be a great move In other words you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be a bench player for you over the next few weeks In turn you get Faulk back just in time for your playoff push But youre banking on Making the playoffs and Faulk being ready by week Only you can judge your chances for but from all Im hearing seems pretty darn likely If youve got the playoffs spot sewn up it could be a great move to trade for Faulk now Dont give up too much Dont hesitate to let the Faulk owner know that teammate DMarco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar injury and we all know a RBs knee takes much more stress with the cutting that does a Defensive Tackles Throw in some comments about St Louis resting Faulk for the playoffs Speaking of the resting for the playoff factor You have to look at how well the Saints are playing The Super Bowl champs are in real danger of not even winning their own division It looks like St Louis will be battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility the Rams resting all their players doesnt seem as likely as it did a month ago Another reason you shouldnt give up too much in trading for Faulk Make sure to sell your position either way based on whether youre a Faulk owner or not If youre trading him away you want to talk up the Saints and the tough scenarios if St Louis loses again the hot Giants are next on the road St Louis will be fighting for their lives youll say If youre dealing for Faulk obviously youll take the other side of the fence and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the postseason The truth in my opinion lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed back into service for the regular season Assuming the surgery rehab goes well of course Faulks one of the tougher guys in the league so I have no reason to believe he wont make a normal recovery Bottom line is

precious rights and help select our leaders Defensive Opportunities Duane Cahill from the Pittsburgh Tribune Review checks in with his weekly look at defensive situations across the league that could create opportunities for the offensive players across the line from them Once again this week Zach Thomas finds himself on the inactive list Without him the Miami D gave up yards to Ahman Green last Sunday James Stewart scored three times a couple of weeks back against the Bucs tough D without MLB Jamie Duncan so theres no reason not to start him regardless of the matchup In the same game keep an eye on Stephen Boyds status with the Lions Hes missed most of the weeks practices with a bruised foot that was sore enough there was concern it was fractured If he cant go that opens things up for the Fins Lamar Smith Keith Brooking joined Jessie Tuggle on the IR this week meaning that Mike Alstott will have huge holes up the middle of the Falcons defense to rumble through Look for big games from both him and Warrick Dunn Bryce Paup and Orlando Thomas remain out of the Vikings lineup which bumps Brett Favres stock up a few notches Shaun King had a field day last week For the second straight week Jerome Bettis is facing a defensive line without key components Henry Ford is out and Kenny Holmes is nursing a very sore shoulder Holmes will have to tough it out since backup Byron Frisch is inactive The bus should keep rollin on Duane Cahill Pittsburgh TribuneReview FFL Columnist TFL Report News and Notes Bob Harris TFL Report is one of my favorite sources for indepth insights and analysis Lots of sites tell you whats happened Bob tells you what it means Here are a few selections for this weeks report THE GLOVES ARE OFF JOHNSON ACCUSES FLUTIE OF INSTIGATING IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE As reported by Mark Gaughan of the Buffalo News Rob Johnson may be on the sidelines but hes no longer silent about the Buffalo Bills brewing quarterback controversy Johnson took exception to a column in this weeks Sports Illustrated that quoted two unidentified Bills speaking about the teams quarterbacks The story quoted one Bill as saying Rob seems distracted by things like wanting everyone to like him It quoted another as saying Hed rather get pummeled by four guys than throw the ball away in order to help his quarterback rating Johnson who did not make himself available to local media this week went on the Jim Rome nationally syndicated radio show Friday and said he thinks it was one player who made the comments And he thinks that one player was Doug Flutie I think everyone who reads the article will pretty much know who it is Johnson said I think its the same one thats pictured in the article The only Bill pictured in the article is Flutie Johnson said he confronted the player whom he suspected on Friday We talked about it today Johnson said He said he talked about the quarterback rating stuff but he never mentioned my name Basically that was it Asked if he thought Flutie was a good teammate Johnson said Im sure hes a good teammate for the rest of the guys and hes fine with them Obviously hes real competitive Hes reaching the end of his career He probably wants to still play I dont blame him for that But if he was responsible for these comments I would not consider him a good teammate Johnson said he did not see the team being divided over the QB question I dont see it that way he said I dont know though I mean I havent talked to all the players But I dont think many players in our locker room worry about quarterback rating or even worry about what our quarterback ratings are Its absurd to think players worry about that or even quarterbacks worry about that when they are playing in a football game However he said he didnt like unattributed comments from teammates For someone to go anonymously and say those things is kind of I dont know cowardly he said Its not typical of football players If a lot of guys feel that way they should come to me and say it to my face he said Im a man Theyre men and I can take it Id rather hear about it from them than hear about it on the radio when Im driving home from an FM channel when Im trying to listen to Limp Biskit Regarding the desire to be liked by his teammates Johnson said Im years old Most of guys on our team are pretty young and we have a lot in common We hang out I dont go out of my way to make friends or kiss anyones butt Everywhere Ive been on teams Ive had a good relationship with the guys on the team and I have a lot in common with them Asked if he got the sense he was competing against Joe Montana for the QB job Johnson replied I wish it was Joe Montana because at least he won some Super Bowls and won MVPs in the league I wish that was the case I think that would be an easier situation Regarding his injured shoulder Johnson said it is not percent It tightened up on me pretty good today he said I havent been able to get my arm pretty much all the way over the top or raise it all the way above my head to throw the ball Ive kind of been sidearming things just trying to get through practice so I could be the backup I dont know what they are going to do I want to back up but that might not be in the best interest in the team this week Head coach Wade Phillips said Friday he would wait until pregame warmups Sunday to decide whether Johnson would be numbertwo or numberthree against New England Although Phillips wasnt willing to address the escalating tension between Johnson and Flutie Buffalo general manager John Butler speaking on the Empire Sports Network said he doesnt fear the team is in turmoil I was at practice today and it looked like a football team preparing for the New England Patriots he said Ill tell you if youve been around sports been in locker rooms if you get men together not everybody is going to like everybody all the time The key is to be respectful of one another and when it comes time to play you play hard and play together Everybody isnt going to be walking hand in hand down the hallways but weve got a team thats going to stick together and play their hearts out and thats all that matters These are grown men Sometimes its fun to even blow it up a little bit more than it is and so be it Its incumbent upon our team to stick together and they will he said Ive been through this times Butler dismissed the SI quotes because they had no attribution If you want to say something and cant put your name to it it bothers me he said Youve got a problem somewhere so I dont put any substance to it Stay tuned boys and girls We havent heard the last of this one REDMOND INJURES FOOT PATS LIKELY TO RELY ON FAULK IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to Frank DellApa of the Boston Globe it looks like Kevin Faulk will be asked to carry running game when the New England Patriots take on the Buffalo Bills tomorrow Faulks opportunity comes at the expense of rookie JR Redmond who displaced Faulk in the starting lineup with a carry yard performance against the Colts two weeks ago but was downgraded to questionable on Fridays injury report after hurting his foot in practice Thursday According to head coach Bill Belichick Redmond stepped on something at practice and wasnt able to do much Friday I dont know if Ill be playing more Faulk said Whatever the game plan is Im ready every week Faulk will be facing a difficult test this time Buffalo has surrendered rushing yards the secondlowest total in the NFL All you have to do is check the stats Faulk said Teams dont average more than yards a carry against them The Patriots are averaging yards per rush and Faulk is averaging yards per rush Its always a challenge but this time its even more of a challenge because we are going against one of the best defenses in the league Faulk said We cant expect to run over them no What we need is a balanced attack If we can get that going and move the football we should be all right Faulk was on pace to gain more than yards after four games but he has tailed off with a total of yards in the last four games But Faulk is the teams leading allpurpose yardage player with yards an average of yards each time he has the ball Team officials had hoped the Redmonds ascension to the first team would allow Faulk to concentrate on what most observers feel he is best suited for thirddown duty As productive as he might have been the first half of the season concerns over Faulks durability have been an issue from day one and Belichick is convinced the former LSU standouts ability to run the ball effectively is inversely proportional to the number of time he carries it Other items of interest After working extensively at wide receiver this week tight end Eric Bjornson was included on the teams list of early inactives yesterday And his chances of contributing to the offense in coming weeks dont sound very good after team officials indicated that Rod Rutledge will start at tight end for the remainder of the season Wide receiver Terry Glenn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice but hes listed as probable and coaches expect him to start and play as usual against the Bills tomorrow Quarterback Drew Bledsoe missed Thursdays practice in order to stay with his wife as she gave birth to the couples third child The veteran signal caller will start and play as usual tomorrow REDSKINS JOHNSON HAS SIGNIFICANT MCL TEAR IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Mark Maske of the Washington Post reported this morning that Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson is suffering from a significant tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee that is relatively close to being a complete tear Maske went on to write even when his MCL heals sufficiently for him to resume playing Johnson will face the risk of suffering a more severe knee injury by playing on the damaged joint He will have to decide how much risk to take playing for a team he might leave via free agency in the offseason at a time when his contract is about to expire and he has no guaranteed income beyond this season As he exited Redskins Park yesterday Johnson acknowledged the increased risks but said he plans to play again this season and will make his decisions based solely upon his physical readiness to play not upon future financial considerations He said the timetable for his return is unclear but he refused to rule out the possibility of playing in the St Louis game Team officials expect Johnson to miss that November meeting with the Rams Of course the former Viking has already been ruled out for tomorrows game against Arizona and Jeff George will make his first appearance with Washingtons first team offense this season Maske cited a source close to the situation as saying coaches hope Johnson will return in time for the teams November meeting with Philadelphia at FedEx Field Johnson told Maske yesterday that he has every intention of playing again this season Theres no doubt about that he will play again this season I think its a matter of when The weeks kind of go by fast But were still dealing with seven more games a bye week and the playoffs Right now our team just has to find a way to win and Ive got to find a way to get healthy In time then well get back together Johnson said he would like to be ready to play against the Rams the defending Super Bowl champions The Redskins have days between games because they have a bye the weekend after Sundays Arizona game We probably wont make a decision about the St Louis game until the Wednesday or Thursday before the game Johnson said I would like to play I think that would be a great game to be part of The biggest decision isnt whether its artificial turf or grass Its just being able to drop back and being healthy enough to play a full game However Maskes sources indicate the Redskins are already planning for George to start against St Louis a week from this coming Monday Team officials have described Johnsons injury as a Grade MCL sprain but Maskes sources say the injury is at the severe end of the Grade range and actually borders on being a Grade sprain A Grade injury is defined as one in which the tissue has been partially but not completely torn and there is appreciable limitation in function A Grade injury is one in which tissue has been significantly or completely torn or disrupted and there is a virtually complete loss of function NFL players regularly play with MCL injuries The risk players take by playing on damaged knees is that they will suffer more severe knee injuries Johnson said he knows the risks but will play when he is able The biggest thing is right now the ligament is weak he said Obviously right now It could worsen very easily if I took a hit There hasnt been a whole lot of discussion about that The biggest discussion now is how were going to treat it and get back as soon as possible When Im healthy enough to drop back and play then Ill play that day Johnson says the fact he intends to test the free agent market after the season wont be a factor in determining when he plays again The most important thing for me is to be able to drop back in the pocket Johnson said From that point on if I can drop back in the pocket then Ill play Im not worried about ever taking a hit Ive gone through injuries before The biggest thing to me is being healthy enough to play Im not worried about a contract next year with anyone I feel like my play overall and my history will take care of itself Johnson was on the practice field yesterday with his knee heavily wrapped He moved little made some throws and mostly watched George and rookie quarterback Todd Husak who has been elevated from third to second on the Redskins depth chart at work I feel much better than I did Tuesday or Wednesday Johnson said I can throw normal Theres no problem there I can do a lot of walking I ride the exercise bike about an hour a day The problem is going lateral side to side As a quarterback thats what you do in the pocket So Im not able to drop back at full speed and throw But Im better than I was earlier in the week Other notes of interest out of Washington this morning Veteran fullback Larry Centers comes off a productive game last Monday night catching six passes for yards and a touchdown Given the Redskins injury problems at wide out Centers could get a number of looks out of the backfield this week against his old team the Cardinals Although Albert Connell Irving Fryar and James Thrash are all expected to play the chances of any of them going full speed are slim Look for cornerback Champ Bailey will see his most extensive playing time of the season at wide receiver in order to provide a legitimate deep threat to keep the Cards from focusing their all of their attention RB Stephen Davis Davis had yards on attempts in his two games against the Cardinals in and in what will be a scaledback game plan hes likely to get carries against the Cardinals marshmallowsoft defensive front seven IMAGE BRONCOS KNOW DAVIS IS CRUCIAL TO THEIR SUCCESS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE This is it Its time for Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis to make his second comeback of the season against the Jets tomorrow Unlike the season opener when all eyes were on the veterans surgically reconstructed right knee this time everybody will be watching Davis badly sprained left foot and ankle that get all the attention The former University of Georgia star has missed five of the last seven games including three in a row and has gained only total yards on carries Dont look for coaches to push Davis incredibly hard in his first game back In fact Davis isnt sure how much he might be capable of doing this week Let me just finish this game If I can finish this game Ill be the happiest man on this planet Davis said If I can stay healthy I know good things are going to happen And make no mistake about it Keeping Davis healthy becomes job numberone from here on out Coaches are certainly aware than whatever chances the team might have of making a playoff run lie in having a healthy and productive Davis in the mix So the goal this week will be easing him back into playing shape by giving him maybe carries tomorrow with Mike Anderson taking the rest One factor working in Davis favor Howard Griffiths return to the lineup after experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired left knee the last two weeks The veteran fullback said its all part of the process however and has practiced full speed all week Its getting there Its not going to be percent until Im not banging people anymore he said Bottom line on Davis My expectations are high for him over the remainder of the season but Im not sure Id want to bank on a huge game in his first week back One last note out of Denver this morning Backup running back KaRon Coleman was included on Fridays list of early inactives due to a sprained foot A RELIEVED JEFF GEORGE READY TO FACE CARDINALS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Friday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to the Associated Press veteran quarterback Jeff George looked relieved and relaxed after practice Friday It was easier to concentrate on his upcoming first start with the Washington Redskins knowing that his newborn baby was doing fine Thank God George said I think whenever something goes wrong and its your own you worry First things first My familys numberone in my life and I got to take care of them George is starting Sundays game at Arizona because Brad Johnson sprained a knee ligament in Monday nights loss to Tennessee But instead of preparing fulltilt for his first action of the season George missed practice Wednesday when his wife delivered their third child The next day George was distracted by news that the baby Jayden Scott had breathing difficulties It was only just before Thursday afternoons practice that he received word that the baby was fine George who earlier this season answered dad when asked to give one word to describe himself was confident he could overcome the distractions and give a good performance Sunday When you get some sort of news like we did George said you take a back seat and say Whats more important But Ive prepared myself It hasnt been just this week Ive been preparing the last weeks Its not a cram session Ive been preparing from the getgo George signed a fouryear million contract in April to back up Johnson so he could have a shot at playing for a Super Bowl team He said he doesnt see Sundays game as an audition either to replace Johnson or to build interest in other teams considering an offseason trade I think everybody knows what I can do George said Weve got an injury and Ive got to carry the torch You hate to have to play under these circumstances Brads my friend I wish him well I hope he recovers fast Johnson who could miss two to four weeks with the injury is one of many ailing Redskins starters including wide receivers Irving Fryar and Albert Connell who are likely to be less than full speed for Sundays game I probably feel the healthiest out of anybody George said Coaches might have Skip Hicks handle kickoff returns against the Cardinals this Sunday in an attempt to lighten the workload for James Thrash who has been returning kickoffs and punts starting at wide receiver and playing on kickoff and punt coverage teams Great stuff as always from Bob For more

see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Stephen Davis Was vs Cowboy Defense New Coach Terry Robiskies be en saying hell run Davis into the ground Against a run defense as soft a s the Cowboys no telling how many yards hell gain The arm seems o k and I look for a huge game here RBs roll up yards on Dallas like its an average day Darnell Autry Chris Warren Phi vs Brown Defense It remains to be se en what effect if any newly signed Chris Warren will have this week It wouldnt surprise me a bit if Andy Reid isnt able to come up with a t least a small package of plays that feature Warren Hes a thousand times b etter than Darnell Autry If he cant go this week Id look for him to b e a factor next week for sure The Browns defense ranks in rushing yard s allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is enticing Fred Taylor Jac vs Cardinal Defense Every once in a while those t oo good to be true matchups dont pan out This is certainly one of t hose too good to be true situations but Id be shocked if Taylor doe snt just roll over the Cards They cant stop the run even when they know what s coming at them Arizona ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last month That number wont go down any after this week Mike Anderson Den vs Seahawk Defense Starting any player facing the Seahawks is not a bad rule of thumb Theyve been pretty bad and this week they dont stand a chance against the dominating OL of Denver Anders on practiced fully Thursday so he looks good to go Keep an eye on the weathe r as theyre expecting snow in Denver but Im not too worried about ho w itll effect Anderson Ron Dayne NYG vs Steeler Defense This was the type of game they draft ed Dayne for A ground war vs Pittsburgh in December Its not likely t he Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode whic h means pretty much no Dayne This is shaping up to be a classic battle wit h Bettis on one side and Warren on the other Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Sammy Morris Shawn Bryson Buf vs Colts Defense Keep an eye on who c an go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will likely have some good rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana There were some semi encouraging signs that Morris might be back The Colts rank just over the last weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre soft on the run and someone could make a big splash on Monday Night Charlie Garner SF vs Saints Defense Just as they are with their pass defense the Saints rush defense is overrated Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game And Garner is liable to explode at any time Hes too good in both the rushing and passing gam e to consider sitting down unless youre just loaded Warrick Dunn TB vs Miami Defense It was surprising to me to see the Dolphins slide this far on rush defense Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Doesnt seem right but t hats what the numbers say Either way Dunns a must start given what he s done lately Robert Smith Min vs Ram Defense Like the passing defense the Rams ru sh defense has improved over the year It doesnt matter though You ve got to start Robert Smith End of story He may be the best RB in the leagu e if truth be told Emmitt Smith Dal vs Redskin Defense I think I may be the only one who sees it this way but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real statement for Smith Sure he still may not get the rd down carries as they get a look at Michael Wiley but Emmitt is pretty much working without a net here He proved his mettle once again last week hammering against a tough Tampa team The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in their passing game as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when trailing badly Washington ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so theyre very beatable Tony Richardson KC vs Panther Defense Another week another RB shakeu p in KC as this time its Kimble Anders whos out of the mix I hones tly have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it looks like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now The Panthe rs can be run on Keep an eye on the weather in this one as the passing game could be limited James Allen Chi vs Patriot Defense What a mess Chicago finds itself in The messiah QB is now healthy but still on the bench while the gu ru offensive coordinator has left been run out of town for Utah and both starting WRs are gone for the year with injuries James Allen may be the bright spot as hes run hard and effectively The New England defense c an be vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on Allen to carry a heavy load Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Edgerrin James Ind vs Bills Defense Edgerrin may be having one of th e best poor seasons in NFL history Hes posting great numbers ov erall but youll have a hard time finding a James owner whos real happy with h im If hes your guy you have very little choice but to start him in the Mond ay Night game The Colts are tougher at home and hopefully they wont fin d themselves playing catchup again Although with his receiving ability he s still active in that situation but its not the ideal scenario for any R B when his team is playing from behind The Bills rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so its a pretty average rushing defense Tyrone Wheatley Oak vs Jets Defense Ill keep an eye on this one fo r you but Im hearing while the ankles may be better a broken finger may be giving him trouble Some are speculating this is the cause of his fumbl es last week The Jets play pretty solid rush defense so its truly a mat chup that could go either way Ill try to see what I can find out on this one Michael Pittman Ari vs Jaguar Defense The Pittman injury watch continues as hes still battling turf toe He sat out of practice Thu rsday and may not know his status until Friday or Saturday If he cant go it looks like Clarence Williams could get the start If youre scrambling for RBs hes likely available in your league Even assuming Pittman can go its not a great matchup as the Jags have picked up the level of their play lately Lamar Smith Mia vs Buccaneer Defense Dont let the Buc defense scar e you Theyre a very good unit but as Emmitt Smith proved last week a determined rusher can fare ok there Lamar Smith surely falls under that determined class If hes your guy Id still go with him Tampa ranks over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre allowing an average of yards per game over that time so its not li ke theyre Baltimore yards per game over their last Curtis Martin NYJ vs Raider Defense Like Tampa the Raiders rush defen se has a bark thats a little worse than their bite Theyre solid but not a defense that sends RBs running for cover They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Martin looked great last week and looks to be guy theyre counting on to carry the offense Eddie George Ten vs Bengal Defense Most people have this image in the ir heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run Not so Over the last four weeks only teams are tougher in allowing rushing yards per game Maybe thats because teams choose to pass the ball where Cincinn ati is weak but the bottom line is teams dont run a tremendous amount on t hem However if QB Steve McNair is limited with a bad ankle and knee you ll see a team that runs the ball as their st nd and rd option pretty much their style with a healthy McNair too George is a must start even though its no slam dunk on the matchup James Stewart Det vs Packer Defense Depending on the weather and Charl ie Batchs ribs Stewart could be asked to carry the load this week Gree n Bay is hurting on Defense with DT Steve Warren the latest injured Packer on defense On the flip side theyre playing pretty stingy rush defense averaging rushing yards allowed per game over their last which ranks them Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Brad Hoover Car vs Chief Defense With Tshimanga Biakabutuka revertin g back to his normal cant stay healthy form hes displayed fo r most of his career Hoover gets another shot this week The Chiefs are tough at home a nd the weather could be a factor possibly in his favor but Hoover will take his power rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares Kansas City ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so th ey re pretty solid Travis Prentice Jamel White Cle vs Eagle Defense Neither of these gu ys is doing a great job and theyll both likely struggle against an Eagle team thats serious about defense If it were me Id look elsewhere if these were my guys Marshall Faulk Stl vs Viking Defense While theyre under appreciate d the Viking rush defense is pretty good Over the last four weeks they ra nk in rushing yards allowed per game Theyll have all they want wi th Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher ones Faulk will f ace Hes still a no brainer to start regardless of the opponent Hes reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being worried about them both Coach Mike Martz has talked about using him on special teams to help turn that unit around JR Redmond Patrick Pass Kevin Faulk NE vs Bears Defense With Redmond still ailing the Patriot RB situation is a mess And Bill Belichi ck certainly isnt shedding much light on anything Unless Redmond shows he can be Id probably shy away from all of them as its too mu ch of a shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick The Bears are playing pretty tough rush defense with rookie sensation Brian Urlacher Ahman Green GB vs Lion Defense One bright spot for the Packers this year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green Coach Mike Holmgren in Seattle could have likely saved a pick on Alexander if Green was still in Seattle Greens always had the physical skills but he lagged behin d in other areas Now he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up significantly and the results are showing on the field Its a tough ma tchup as the Lions rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed pe r game but I think hes up for it Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Ricky Watters Sea vs Bronco Defense Denver evidently didnt take k indly to Corey Dillon hanging a Hall of Fame type day on them several weeks ago as theyve been tough against the run since then Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing just yards pe r game Watters is a solid player and not unlike an Emmitt Smith hes a guy thats made a living performing against the tough teams in tough games So its not like Im terrified of this matchup Just be aware it s a tough one One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has said at some point he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander especially in the passing game How much hed like to see isnt kn own right now Terrell Fletcher SD vs Baltimore Defense Lets not go there Baltimore is allowing an average of yards rushing per game over their last games I dont see Fletcher as the guy who breaks that trend Jerald Moore Chad Morton Terry Allen NO vs er Defense Early this week both Moore and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss Sundays game They appear to be healing ahead of schedule and now it looks like both may play Allen spent time running with the first unit in practice so its really murky right now Id tend to shy away from a ll these guys as I think theyll let QB Aaron Brooks throw the ball like he did last week Besides the ers are deceptively stingy against the rush ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Corey Dillon Cin vs Titan Defense Yes this is a tough matchup But s o was Denver and the jersey Dillon wore in that particular tough matchup is now hanging in Canton Ohio I learned and I hope you did too to go wit h the young man pretty much regardless of the opponent Tennessee is very go od in defending the rush but I see very little way you could bench Dillon unless youre just loaded Jamal Lewis Bal vs Charger Defense Lewis is clearly the class of the rookie crop offensively I hear some say they think his early season elbo w injury was actually a blessing as it let him stay fresh I dont know about that but I do know hes running very hard and effectively He doe s draw a tough matchup this week against a Charger defense thats only allowing rushing yards per game over the last games which earns them a ranking of Still though you pretty much have to ride Lewis if he s your guy Jerome Bettis Pit vs Giant Defense This could be a classic battle between two big backs in Ron Dayne and Jerome Bettis Bettis lives for the se kind of games and hell get to lay it on the line Sunday Hes a l ikely starter in your league but the Giants are tough against the rush Over th e last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game I d still feel good about starting Bettis if he were on my roster but you need to be aware itll likely be tough going To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is mea nt to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software fo r more info Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Seattle Passing Game vs Bronco Defense If weve seen one trend rece ntly in defenses its to start your QB WR TEs against the Broncos and wo rry about your RBs Theyre tough on the running game but easy against the pass I wont get into whether thats a chicken or the egg situation but the bottom line is go with your passing guys against Denver They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks QB Jon Kitna gets another start and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in him hes been ok Derrick Mayesand Sean Dawkinsshould see lots of action and rookie Darrell Jacksonis working his way back into the mix I f youve been sitting on RB Shaun Alexander coach Mike Holmgren did sa y he wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but Im still not too excited about him yet Tennessee Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Once again keep an eye on QB Steve McNairshealth this week Its early but hes already b eing called a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle injuries Keep your fingers crossed as its a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pa ss defense They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last month and are just playing out the season Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost for the year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier Derrick Masonis the clear cut WR with Chris Sanders The best receiver on the team or at least most utilized is TE Frank Wycheckwho s starting to get back to his normal high level of production Denver Passing Game vs Seahawk Defense By now you know the drill Sta rt any player vs Seattle Just do it The Seahawks are anemic QB Brian Griese did start to throw some but hes still at least a couple weeks a way maybe more Gus Frerottegets another start and if youre looking for him to regain that yard form he showed early on this is his best chance to do it Rod Smithand Ed McCaffreyare the usual must starts at WR Dway ne Carswelland Desmond Clarkare excellent plays at TE Id start eithe r one and feel pretty good about it especially Carswell Baltimore Passing Game vs Charger Defense San Diego made a run back at respectability on defense but Im thinking theyve fallen back down t o well below average Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be ready to roll QB Trent Dilferis playing exceptionally well and WRs Qadry Ismailand Patrick Johnsoncould do well The most enticing matchu p may be Shannon Sharpeas San Diego ranks just th in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year St Louis Passing Game vs Viking Defense I dont think you keep QB K urt Warnerdown for long Sure he had an awful game last week but some of th at can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you dont see drop half of what Warn er throws this time The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last month For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Isaac Bruce is the best WR while Torry Holthas been surprisingly disappointing lately Hes still worth a start though AzZahir Hakimalways has a chance too The Vikings just dont have the secondary to keep up with these guys Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Colt Defense I probably get more mail from my ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player I make no apologies as I really just dont like the guy He simply has major troubles finishin g a game Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy one of th e weaker defenses in the league Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is questionable so they might be even less effective On the other hand th e Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home As you can see from my rankings Im not thinking too much of Johnson again this week but he does have a good matchup Eric Moulds is the primary WR as always with Peerle ss Price and Jeremy McDonald picking up the scraps TE Jay Reimersma is a favorite target and gets plenty of looks Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Giants Defense The Kordell Stewart Bandwagon is getting awfully crowded lately but for good reason Hes playing ve ry solid football More importantly he cleared a huge hurdle Sunday showing some leadership and toughness coming back in the game after injuring his leg The Giants defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim Fassells media games where he says ok more than Joe Pesci in L ethal Weapon are apparently working as his playoff guarantee seems to have inspired the team The pass defense still ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last month though For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Hines Ward is the WR of choice on this team and Id feel fine starting him Hes not even th e true guy but you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw For some reason I like him over starter Courtney Hawkins Even TE Mark Bruener is a solid choice as hes done more in the last two weeks than hes done in two years Kansas City Passing Game vs Panthers Defense Im dreading the Gunther Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like Iron Mike A soli d game here could help him keep his job which may have Chief fans pulling f or Carolina From a FF perspective I like Elvis Grbac here He showed Monday night he was clearly back from the finger troubles As usual the running game is a mess but thats good news for Elvis owners as hes forced to go with whats been working for them throwing the ball TE To ny Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and he s certainly the best receiver on the team Derrick Alexander is a sure starter too Sylvester Morris continues to regress which is troubling Carolina ranks just in passing yards allowed per game over the last four games although for the year theyve fared better ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Part of that is they seem to give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be leery in TD only leagues Carolina Passing Game vs Chief Defense If youve been fence sitting w ith Steve Beuerlein this may be a week to take a close look at him The Chief s rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and they may be missing CB James Hasty whos questionable with a knee WR Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and hes a sure starter Donald Hayes got through last weeks game without reinjuring his groin and hes a solid option as well TE Kris Mangum is no Wesley Wa lls but hes a pretty good player The Chiefs do get back home where they re tougher but I like this matchup San Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense The er pass defense is better than people think and the Saints defense is worse than many assume Over the last four games New Orleans ranks in passing yards allowed per game the ers rank In reality both defenses are pretty suspect And both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball Jeff Garcia picked up right where he left off last week against a tough San Die go defense It was great news for Terrell Owens fans as he looks on his way back In the meantime Jerry Rice showed he still has a few tricks in the bag I wouldnt be surprised to see Tai Streets and JJ Stokes see increased time at Rices expense though as many feel the Hall of Famer isnt in the ers plans for RB Charlie Garner is always a threat cat ching the ball TE Greg Clark is suddenly a producer so hes worth a shot to o This could be a shootout Jacksonville Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Two teams heading for the couch in the post season but thats about all they have in common Jacksonville just ran out of time as theyre playing well now Arizona is heading downhill from an already low position Arizona ranks over t he last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game QB Mark Brunell had a n injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be fine He could be a decent play along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell Arizona CB Aneaes Williams is a player but he cant do it all The biggest probl em for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a yard gain each time Minnesota Passing Game vs Ram Defense You dont need any analysis fro m me to know youd better start Daunte Culpepper Cris Carter and Randy Moss The Rams are much improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Still though the Minnesota Big Big counting RB Robert Smith are no br ainers New Orleans Passing Game vs er Defense QB Aaron Brooks continues to b e one of the better stories of this season Hes facing a er time that ll be chock full of youngsters although theyre playing better of late rankin g in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks But that was before losing Safety Lance Shulters to a torn ACL last week Brooks will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should continue to shine Willie Jackson is a solid WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive lately Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Detroit Passing Game vs Packer Defense Of course all this hinges on the ribs of one Charlie Batch If he cant go all bets are off In fact even if he can go you should hedge your bets a bit as weve already se en one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch Its not a bad matchup though against a Green Bay defense thats ranked in passin g yards allowed per game Johnnie Morton is likely the top choice at WR wi th Herman Moore in the mix too Germane Crowell may be able to make his return this week as hes been practicing this week I wouldnt start him yet but keep an eye out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him up I can see plenty of James Stewart in this one though as the weather could be really nasty for this one Chicago Passing Game vs Patriot Defense This ones full of story line s as a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane Matthews The juicy rumor here is that according to a story in the Sun Times McNown would receive a million escalator clause if he plays i n of the offensive snaps this year and next Hes currently at Conspiracies aside Matthews will be without WR Marcus Robinson whos o ut for the year with a bulging disk in his back New England ranks ove r the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game but the turmoil coul d take its toll on the Bears The Bears will also be without Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job Some think that will be a positive I honestly have a hard time getting too excited about Eddie Kennison and Marty Booker Dallas Passing Game vs Redskin Defense Im really interested to see ho w the team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie Ill be surprised if t hey dont kick things up several notches Although I do find it odd that th e guy in charge of the worst performing part of the team passing game is t he guy they decided to elevate to head coach Who knows QB Troy Aikman will try to get through another game without being maimed Hell have J ames McKnight and Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promisin g against a pretty tough defense Dallas showed last week the complete lac k of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding Emmitt Smith the ball as they trailed Tampa by a mile David LaFluer and Jackie Harris both are dropping along with Aikman Philadelphia Passing Game vs Brown Defense Two teams used to bringing up the rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping QB Donovan McNabb finds himself in a strange spot here The Browns are so pitiful against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them at the expense of throwing it But with McNabb the teams best rusher he ll have to decide which way hes going to beat the Browns Charles Johnson an d Torrance Small arent much TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he could make some noise Im interested to see how quickly they work in newly signed RB Chris Warren Miami Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Another good case of misconceptions Miami is better throwing the ball than people give them credit for and the Bucs arent as dominant stopping the pass like many think Over the last four weeks Tampa ranks in passing yards allowe d per game Very solid for sure but not dominating Jay Fiedler continu es to astound his critics as he threw for TDs Sunday I dont think you ll see the same production here but hes still a decent play Leslie Shep herd had been my favorite WR here but with his surgery it looks like Tony Mart in will finally get a start Oronde Gadsden continues to make sick catches Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Cleveland Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This is where Doug Pedersons at He gets the start this week because rookie Spergon Wynn cant go due to injury WR Kevin Johnson is running the scout team in practice Agai nst the tough Eagles secondary he likely will have trouble no matter where he lines up I dont look for much here from any of these guys Cincinnati Passing Game vs Titan Defense The Bengals just wont die quietly Corey Dillon keeps running the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott Mitchellseems intent on proving to folks he really can play at this level He may be able to but he draws a tough matchup Sunday in a Titan team that s solid They rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed pe r game Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad wrist and will likely have to play with a brace WR Peter Warrickwill reportedly have his contact lenses Thursday and that could make a difference Hes often worth a roll of the dice for the start as he ha s the big play potential New York Giant Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The Steelers seemed to enjoy the spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot this week against the Giants Pittsburghs playing tough pass defense now as they rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four games Kerry Collinsis steady but not exciting Hell be throwing t o WRs Amani Toomerand Joe Jureviciusas it looks like Ike Hilliard may not be fully ready yet this week Keep an eye on that one though TE Pete Mitchellhasnt been nearly the factor wed thought hed be Oakland Passing Game vs Jets Defense The Raiders look to bounce back th is week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and distance The Jets are playing tough defense of late ranking in passi ng yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Still though QB Rich Gannonis a pretty much sure starter unless youre loaded at QB Same thing with WR Tim Brown You might roll the dice on Andre Risonor James Jettbut Brown is the man TE Ricky Dudley is likely worth a start just on potential but hes incredibly frustrating like I needed to tell the D udley owners THAT Green Bay Passing Game vs Lion Defense Not only must the Lions defense hit the field without star CB Bryant Westbrook they also have to face Bre tt Favrein the cold weather where hes invincible Check the weather conditions for this one as it could be more than just cold Hes good when its freezing outside but trying to throw the ball in a driving snowsto rm is an entirely different matter Favre will be throwing to WR Bill Schroede r who I think is the better WR choice over mega bucks Antonio Freeman TE Bubba Franksis always worth a look RB Ahman Greenis a nice surprise a nd hes catching the ball well New York Jets Passing Game vs Raider Defense Two teams thatll see what theyre made of square off in a Sunday Night matchup The Raiders are t ough against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the la st four weeks QB Vinny Testeverdeseems to have finally gotten himself untracked WR Wayne Chrebetmay be handled by Charles Woodson but that leaves Dedric Wardand Windrell Hayesfor WRs Theyll be fine FB Ri chie Andersonquietly racks up receiving totals and he could have a good day aga in this week TE Anthony Becht continues to play well and is really coming along New England Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Star QBs on the bench Coaches leaving Whats a player to think If youre a defensiv e player for the Bears youre thinking youd better go out and prove some pe ople wrong that think youre finished Chicago plays tough pass defense rank ing in passing yards allowed per game over the last four week QB Drew Bledsoe will look for WR Terry Glennand the suddenly red hot Troy Brown TEs Rod Rutledgeand Jermaine Wigginshold down the TE spot I hope Shockmain Davis gets a TD as I love to write his name Indianapolis Passing Game vs Bills Defense QB Peyton Manningis still a starter in most leagues but you should know hes facing a tough matchup this week He struggled a bit last time these teams met with a season low yards passing although he did have TDs Marvin Harrisonis of course the clear cut Guy It looks like Terrence Wilkinsis finally breaki ng out of his slump and could be a contributor again Both TEs Ken Dilgerand Marcus Pollardhavent played up to their potential of late Even wit h the bad game last week against Miami the Bills still rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed per game Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Miami Defense Dont start your passing ga me guys against the Dolphins CBs Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain just shut people down Especially a QB like Shaun King whos not healthy in addition to being just an adequate QB Keyshawn Johnson is almost always worth a start just for the showmanship but Im not excited about Tampa throwing the ball here Washington Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Brad Johnsonsprobably tak en his last snap as a Redskin especially after he suggested hed done so That means big armed Jeff Georgetakes the helm Hell likely face a Cow boy defense thats tough against the pass for one simple reason theyre awful defending the run and teams just choose to run all over them Look for Stephen Davis to wear it out When George does throw I think James Thrashis the best option Albert Connellwill likely start but Thrash makes plenty of plays TE Stephen Alexanderis probably worth a shot as is pass catching FB Larry Centers San Diego Passing Game vs Raven Defense Ryan Leafand company get the honor of facing the ranked defense over the past weeks in pas sing yards allowed per game It should be interesting Leaf will be throwing to TE Freddie Jonesand WR Curtis Conway Jeff Graham suffered a mouth injury last week and may need dental surgery Its probably just as wel l as this matchup is looking very sketchy for Leaf Arizona Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense This could get ugly all around Jacksonville ranks over the last four weeks in passing yards allowed p er game And Arizonas Jake Plummeris nursing bad ribs We saw with Cha rlie Batch last week that its hard for a team to keep a QB in the game if h es got injured ribs David Bostonis playing well lately and Frank Sanders h as been awful Im not excited about any of them for this week To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

let the world know about it Weve got our Wall of Champs up and running and waiting for you Check it out here wallcfm You can add your team here addwallcfm Theres not much better than flaunting your success in front of your league members Enjoy Correction In the rushing Matchups I just sent I mentioned Stacey Mack playing the Raiders last week Obviously I meant the Vikings as I wrote about in the week matchups Thanks Hi Folks Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Jeff Garcia may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Brett Favre Garcias your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Jake Plummer came up small last week with just yards against a hot Dallas pass Defense Surprisingly David Boston was a non factor with just yards Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so theres nothing to worry about Carolina ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Tim Couch threw for yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was the th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning McNair and Garcia Clearly the matchup helped him out Kevin Johnson as usual was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way The Titans have been awful lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Again some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide Im not saying Couch will have a great game Check the cheatsheet rankings for where we have him What Im saying is that he has a great matchup here against the Titans whove struggled against the pass all year Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Jay Fiedler exploded for yards and a TD last week Finally Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with yards on receptions He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok this week TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away He rolled up yards and TDs with Interceptions against Indy Sunday Wayne Chrebet was the primary WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action TE Anthony Becht produced another TD The Bills rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Kurt Warner had an off day for him with just yards and TDs Of course hes a must start every week The trouble with him is he spreads the ball around so well its tough to predict which WR will see action but Id have a very hard time benching guys like Holt Bruce or even Proehl Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but hes saying hes ok The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Marty Booker catching yards worth of passes isnt as remarkable until you realize QB Jim Miller only threw for yards I guess that makes Booker the WR Hes clearly the favored option This team is all about Anthony Thomas and their defense though so Im not too excited about any of these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup The Lions rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Brett Favre made the most out of yards throwing for TDs last week Hes too good to sit against anyone Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was earlier this year The Vikings rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Indianapolis Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Manning was back on track again with yards TD and Interceptions last week The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is hes still one of the leagues best QBs Marvin Harrison was incredible catching nearly everything in his sight The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Remember Chris Weinke rolled over them last week For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game Its funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just yards but thats whats happening Hes spoiled us Im not worried about him as along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown theyre still one of the better passing units in the game Charlie Garner is a nice target too This week theyll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Brad Johnson put together a great game with TDs and Interceptions on yards Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of him I dont see many other viable FF options Johnson to Johnson is the name of this passing game Baltimore ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Weinkes yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams were ranked as the passing defense over the last weeks going into last week Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee The Cardinals rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Brian Griese should be back and ready to go Gus Frerotte is out for the year so Jarius Jackson will be the guy Rod Smith is the only receiver of note and hes a guy you can never count out The bye week helped and hes reportedly feeling better than he has in a while Oakland has struggled lately on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Brunell had a Brunelllike day last week with yards and a TD Jimmy Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just about any league The Chiefs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Trent Green put together a decent day with yards TD and Interceptions Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander did very little Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as his owners would like to see Hes still a must start for TE leagues The Jaguars rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call The Vikings have imploded If Bouman starts its much better news for Moss If Wynn starts Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter because it couldve been his last game in Minnesota Honestly its tough to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB WRs are rarely a sure thing The Packers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now Good for Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb James Thrash and Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they werent too effective Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick a WR The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up TDs last week and yards Theres serious MVP talk about him and deservedly so WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any team Burress in particular is coming on lately The Bengals are tougher than many realize against the pass lately They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Doug Flutie was awful early but made a great recovery to finish with yards and TDs with no Interceptions Theres a lot of talk about letting Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we wouldve seen him last week if that was the case Either way Fluties probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues Of the WRs Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action as well The Seahawks rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Matt Hasselbeck hasnt carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt itll start now Hes still a below average player WRs Koren Robinson and Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved in the passing game as well The Chargers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Tony Banks threw for yards last week in a tough game with Chicago Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes thrown their way He only caught a couple but TE Zeron Felmister saw passes thrown his way You could do a lot worse for a TE Plus hes got a cool name The Saints rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Van Pelt put together a yard TD passing game last week As usual Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly This week the Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense I cant imagine youre in contention in week with many of these guys on the roster Quincy Carters given me very little to make me think hell do much of anything Of course for the gamblers Rocket Ismail or Joey Galloway can make something happen with just one throw but theyre definite risks San Francisco is ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but its still very clear hes a rookie QB Granted hes got talent and potential but hes still very green Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver Thats not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could continue The Bears rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last week but thats what happened Aaron Brooks had TDs late as the Saints tried to rally from a big deficit Stats are stats though and Brooks owners will take them any way they can get them Joe Horn and Willie Jackson saw tons of action With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again Boo Williams is back as the TE so thats good news The Redskins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week He threw for yards and TD Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too The Eagles have cooled lately where they rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Their blitzing style can cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins experience should help him Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than He managed yards TD and Interceptions Derrick Mason is still the primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying something This week theyll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last week throwing for yards and TDs against Buffalo Terance Mathis Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games As you know though these guys are very inconsistent This week theyll face a Miami Defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense He threw for yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions Qadry Ismail is the preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an impact The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense You pretty much have to avoid all these guys Jon Kitna threw for yards and Interceptions His most newsworthy accomplishment was a sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson Peter Warrick was benched for fielding a punt on his own yard line Warrick should start this week They teased us early but these are clearly still the Bengals Pittsburgh ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Garcia only had yards and TD although he was very close on another but hes still a must start in my book Hes too good and has too many weapons Terrell Owens is of course a starter but JJ Stokes or Tai Streets could be worth a look TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in the passing game Dallas ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyve been tough For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tough matchups but I dont see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless youre just loaded See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see these guys ranked Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is

this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against Yes even after last weeks performance The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Carolina Defense After a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones Michael Pittman seemed to clearly be the prime RB here last week He rushed times for yards ypc plus a TD Thomas Jones on the other hand only had carries for yards The Panthers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this week For the year Carolina ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Atlantas Maurice Smith Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense Probably the strongest criticism of Smith you could offer is that hes losing time to Rodney Thomas Smith was ineffective again last week but did score the cheap TD He ran times for yards ypc Thomas had yards on carries ypc and did bring a spark Smith injured his toe and even though its not believed to be serious its hard to put much faith in him with Thomas coming on This week theyll face a Dolphin defense thats been soft lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Make sure to understand I dont have much faith in either of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank them Its just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run Carolinas Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week against a tough St Louis defense so its tough to count him out He posted yards on carries ypc plus a score This week he gets a much softer defense in Arizona that Emmitt Smith ran over last week The Cardinals rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Detroit Defense Thomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with yards on carries ypc Clearly hes the kind of tough back this team wants yet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder This week hell likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense Ahman Green bounced back as expected and proved why hes one of the leagues elite backs He rolled up yards on carries ypc He did have a yarder thrown in there He did leave with some breathing problems but he is expected to be ok this week Watch to make sure though This week hell face a Viking team that looks like theyve rolled over The Vikings rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs It doesnt always play out in real life but on paper it doesnt get much better than this Miamis Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense Again Lamar Smith was weak rushes for yards ypc and a big fumble But the Dolphins dont seem too excited about going with anyone else so theres always that chance for a cheap TD sort of like with Atlantas Maurice Smith I dont have much faith in him but this week hell face the soft Falcon defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and let the Bills run wild on them last week For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to like the matchup Check the cheatsheets to see exactly where we rank him New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Buffalo Defense Martin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with yards on carries ypc Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Indianapolis Defense Yawn Start Faulk He rolled up yards on carries last week ypc Best player in the game yada yada Hes the man If it matters to you and it shouldnt the Colts rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Denvers Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense Terrell Davis jumps back in the fray after a week of rest Oaklands defense has improved from awful to just bad over the last few weeks They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Oakland allowed Tennessees Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for yards last week so they are getting better Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Kansas City Defense We caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack in the lock column against the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another yard day He rushed times for yards ypc plus TDs Of course just to make you Mack owners nervous Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that Fred Taylor could see action this week or next tuonlinestoriesjaghtml I personally dont see it this week but with this season you never know Kansas City ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Orleans Ricky Williams vs Washington Defense Williams owners like me groaned when the Saints fell behind so early last week Williams was effectively taken out of the game Although truthfully hes been less and less a factor lately regardless of the score He ran for yards on carries ypc and caught passes for yards Thats pretty small This week hell face the Redskins who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tennessees Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense As weird as it sounds Eddie George will get the carries this week by default as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and wont see action The Browns rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimores Terry Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense Allen looked solid last week with yards on carries ypc plus a score He showed little ill effects of being off and actually may have benefited from the rest This week hell face a resurging Buc defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Thats up from last week For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Buffalos Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense As you know Bryson went wild last week rushing for yards on carries ypc plus scores He also tacked on yards on receptions Bryson did have a yard run which padded the stats a little but they all count Henry will likely sit again giving Bryson another start The Jets rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Giants Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense Neither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing times for yards ypc and Dayne only rushing times for yards ypc and a score Barber of course is more active in the passing game This week theyll face an Eagle defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense So much for that rookie wall Tomlinson rushed times for yards ypc last week Clearly hes the primary focus of the offense San Diego has a bye in week thats not really fair is it so this is the last game Drew Brees could see some action which probably means Tomlinson will be even more the focus if thats possible The Seahawks rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Franciscos Garrison Hearst Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense Hearst had a solid but not great game last week with yards on carries ypc Kevan Barlow carried the ball times for yards ypc Barlow also caught passes Hes creeping into Hearsts time This week theyll face a Cowboy Defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tampa Bays Mike Alstott Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense Its tough to predict too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly the featured RB last week rushing for yards on carries ypc with a score Warrick Dunn had rushes for yards ypc and added yards receiving plus a TD This week theyll face a Baltimore defense thats bark is worse than its bite lately They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs That just means that lately theyve given up a lot of yards The Tampa backs have been very up and down so be leery Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Clevelands Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense Jamel White prompted lots of wheres he been comments from the Brown faithful last week as he rolled up yards on carries ypc With James Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable it looks like the Browns will continue to utilize White Hell face a tough Defense this week in Tennessee that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dallas Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense Smith is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with yards on carries ypc He ran pretty well after a slow start and being totally and repeatedly shut down at the goalline Hes clearly just an average to below average back at this point in his career He does look like hell be able to hold off Troy Hambrick though The ers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dont discount the fact Smith is going for another yard season Of course with Quincy Carter at QB Id give it to Emmitt too Detroits Lamont Warren James Stewart vs Chicago Defense James Stewart reinjured his troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren came in and played well rushing times for yards ypc against a super tough Pittsburgh team Although he did get of those yards on one run The going isnt much easier this week against the Bears who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Keep an eye out this week to see whether Stewart or Warren will play Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs St Louis Defense Rhodes put together another excellent game last week against the Jets with yards on carries ypc with score He also tacked on yards on receptions He did have fumbles though This week hell face a tough Ram defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Although it should be noted they let Carolinas Richard Huntley run for yards and a TD on them last week so its not like theyre invincible Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Green Bay Defense Bennett suffered last week from the same problem hes had most of the year He just didnt get enough carries to make a difference Although one could argue that after producing just yards on the carries he was given ypc he didnt deserve any more Bennetts a percentage guy thatll be shut down for a while and then eventually break one long Its just that most teams cant afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett to get going This week hell face a Packer team ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the season they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Philadelphias Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense Duce Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it doesnt matter as hes clearly the Eagles receiver Last week he rushed times for yards ypc But he caught passes for yards This week hell face the Giants who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks More importantly for Staley they rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis Chris FuamatuMaafala vs Cincinnati Defense Coach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and says hell play if hes healthy Tough to say wholl get the call but one has to think that if he plays Bettis will be used just enough to keep him fresh The Steelers are winning without him have a very beatable opponent in Cincinnati this week and dont want to jeopardize their playoff situation where they know theyll need Bettis Plus the Bengals rush Defense is tougher than many think They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Seattles Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense Alexander looked to be making a statement that he should have been the guy all along with yards on carries ypc and a score plus another yards receiving with a TD Hell face the Chargers this week that rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Washingtons Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense Davis was held pretty much in check against the Bears last week with yards on carries ypc He did get the score though Hes clearly the prime weapon here How much would YOU depend on Tony Banks This week he faces a Saints defense thats been tough lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense Dillon ran well against the overhyped Raven rush defense As the numbers showed in the week matchup info Baltimores been nothing special against the run lately They were ranked last week for Dillon and this week they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Sometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation This week though the Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers Pittsburgh ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs This is a MUCH tougher matchup than last week against the Ravens Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Jacksonville Defense Holmes had a on off day for him with only yards on carries and yards receiving Hell be fine Tony Richardson stole another cheap TD Richardsons a gamble as he wont likely get many yards even on a good day but hes a threat for a short TD The Jaguars have been tough lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id still consider Holmes a must start in most leagues but this is a tough matchup Oaklands Charlie Garner Tyrone Wheatley Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense Charlie Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately he didnt run enough He had yards on just carries ypc And most of those were between the s Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley both saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will do anything The Broncos rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so itll be a touch matchup Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to

<22692037.1075861324717.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-20 21:27:21,Footballguys Update Week Passing MatchupsHi Folks Trying to get this to you earlier as many people had asked for it sooner Hope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy Clayton Gray Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs San Diego Defense We rated Plummer as a Lock matchup and he delivered with yards and TDs If only they could play Detroit each week This week theyll face a San Diego team that ranks just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs WR David Boston is unstoppable and a must start Frank Sanders played well too last week but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TD reception Check Plummers status as he has a bruised tailbone but Id feel good about him again this week Atlanta Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last week leading the Falcons to a huge upset over the Packers He threw for yards and TDs Terance Mathis led the way with receptions Mathis suffered a concussion but the early reports are that hell be able to go This week the Falcons face a soft Carolina defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing Chicago Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Jim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like Montana to Rice Sunday I dont recall the last time I saw two consecutive bomb TDs to the same player like that Sunday Millers been up and down but clearly Booker is a guy to watch Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix but this seems to be Bookers show The Viking defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may be able to continue to roll Green Bay Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Favre isnt as red hot as he was but hes still a premier QB He threw for yards and TDs last week He spread the ball pretty well between Billy Schroeder Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford Bradford had the big yardage while Schroeder and Freeman scored All are solid plays TE Bubba Franks continues to be a non factor The Pack draw a great matchup this week in Detroit that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so you have to like that Minnesota Passing Game vs Chicago Defense If youd been thinking about benching Daunte Culpepper Randy Moss or Cris Carter you got your answer Monday night These guys should always be in your lineup as theyre too explosive to sit against any matchup The Bears rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so clearly this is a must start for these guys The only downside to the Moss Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of the party San Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense You dont need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia Hes clearly one of the premier QBs in the game Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviously a must start JJ Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves a look Tai Streets is not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting more involved in the offense each week Its sort of like St Louis where any of these guys are worth a gamble Indy ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so the ers are looking good here Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Does anyone else find the Baltimores self destruction amusing The Grbac tear thing on the sidelines which looked like sweat to me and then Shannon Sharpes posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting about interceptions was pretty funny Can Brian Billick hold it all together Wheres Trent Dilfer when you need him Grbac will be fine I think Sharpe is always a good play if you can stand having him on your team Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options as theyre seeing plenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score Lots of weapons in this passing game Theyll be facing a Jaguar defense thats reeling and beat up They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Jacksonville ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for the year All in all a good matchup here Detroit Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense A perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror Fantasy Charlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is so bad and hes forced to throw on every down Regardless of the reason you have to give this guy some credit as hes clearly becoming more comfortable in the system He threw an amazing attempts last week for yards and TDs Ill take that WR Johnnie Morton led the way with yards RB Lamont Warren had catches but his status is up in the air with the return of James Stewart Green Bay is nothing special against the pass lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they are pretty tough on QBs though ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Trent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have to wonder how much can be done in a week Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready to play this week but you know how that goes Id be leery until I see him play some Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy As always TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat Seattle has been below average lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New England Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Coach Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady would be the starter until further notice Great news for Brady fans whod been sweating a Bledsoe comeback Bradys come back down to earth lately with a mediocre yard day last week but hes still showing promise WR Troy Brown is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of a start in most leagues New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs New Orleans Passing Game vs New England Defense Aaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those including us whod been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype passing TDs plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy Id go with the hot hand and keep him in your lineup Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choice as Willie Jackson is up and down TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach if you need a guy there He caught TDs and looked good doing it New England ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but be careful as Bill Belichick seems to sometimes pull out something special to confuse young QBs Oakland Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense You have to like Rich Gannon here against the Giant defense that was torched by Minnesota last week Gannon threw for yards and TDs Sunday and looks as in control of this offense as ever Jerry Rice looked half his age running all over the field and played outstanding Tim Brown is as good as ever This team has serious weapons and should go deep in the playoffs if not all the way The Giants rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Kordell Stewart once again looked like a real NFL QB He threw for yards and a TD Most importantly he didnt fold up when Jerome Bettis was held down Hines Ward caught passes for yards and a TD and looks to be a good play most every week as hes clearly the go to guy Tennessee ranks just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so these Steelers could have a chance to do something through the air here San Diego Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Doug Fluties magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately Losing TE Freddie Jones last week surely didnt help even though Jones wasnt being thrown to as much as wed like to see Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham struggled with Flutie This Arizona defense could be the ticket though as Charlie Batch discovered last week They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than that They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Kurt Warners a must start obviously As are Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt Both are outstanding Bruce had the big yards Sunday while Holt got the TD RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs just another reason why hes the best Tampa is limping but they rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They do have sacks over the last games so theyre obviously putting pressure on the QB Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Carolina Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Are you really down to starting Chris Weinke I didnt think so Muhsin Muhammad could miss this weeks game with a shoulder injury That means Donald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to go TE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the focus lately Maybe he needs to have another Keyshawn Fit and yell about not getting the ball enough That worked pretty well for him last time The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyre definitely toastable Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense It doesnt appear to be the best thing for the Bengals but Jon Kitna continues to air it out He threw passes Sunday for yards and TD Interceptions The Bengals have about WRs it seems and all are pretty good Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday Darnay Scott is the but its a crowded group there making it tough to pick out any one player The Brown defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so youd think Cincinnati would be able to throw the ball For the year Cleveland ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs though so its not like its a cakewalk Cleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Tim Couch is winning the real NFL games even though hes not doing much for your FF team lately His yard TD Int game Sunday is an example of that Hell get back on track though Kevin Johnson and Dennis Northcutt seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too Honestly I wouldnt count on too much from anyone but Johnson The Bengal defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyve been tough lately For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Indianapolis Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Peyton Manning looked solid even with the broken jaw Jerome Pathon is gone for the year and Reggie Waynes knee is an issue It looks like itll be his old reliable target Marvin Harrison Keep an eye on TE Marcus Pollard as he could easily be the best receiver after Harrison San Francisco ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs You never know when Manning will throw that monster game though so its tough not to play him if hes on your roster Philadelphia Passing Game vs Washington Defense Donovan McNabb didnt wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didnt need to in order to win the game He threw for yards with TD James Thrash is still the go to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice in larger leagues TE Chad Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so you like to see that The Redskins are starting to believe in themselves and now rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks A dangerous game against the Redskins who have nothing to lose and can play with abandon Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense As a consistent Rob Johnson basher Alex Van Pelt kept me from looking bad by playing extremely well Sunday with TDs and yards And he actually finished a game Clearly he gives the Bills a boost Eric Moulds is still the WR but Peerless Price had a huge game with yards and a TD Larry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay Riemersma caught a TD Miami is hurting without CB Sam Madison They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre still tough Denver Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Brian Griese just keeps losing weapons From Ed McCaffrey to Terrell Davis now Rod Smith is limited with a bad ankle Theres only so much a QB can do without his weapons Smith is saying hell try to tough it out and play Thursday but its very questionable how effective hell be if he plays My friend and Denver local BJ Miller says his guess is that Smith will dress but likely not finish the game after reaggravating the ankle Id agree with that prediction TE Desmond Clark needs to become a bigger part of the passing game here The Cowboys are solid on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so its a tough matchup here for the Broncos New York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Kerry Collins threw for yards but couldnt find the endzone Monday night Ike Hilliard continues to improve and actually was more effective than Amani Toomer Tiki Barber remains a strong force in the passing game and that should continue All of these guys are solid starters Oakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Matt Hasselbeck posted yards and TD Sunday With the way Shaun Alexander is running thats probably enough Koren Robinson and Darrel Jackson are the primary targets but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ball around Kansas City ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks although for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Brad Johnson rolled up yards Sunday without throwing a TD Thats hard to do Keyshawn Johnson remains TDless which I admit is cruelly amusing Thatll have to break soon though as hes just catching too many passes not to score I wouldnt be surprised to see him explode with a couple of multiple TD games as the odds even out Johnson to Johnson is really all there is to talk about with this passing game The Rams are solid ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Washington Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Tony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham did a fine job filling in WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this season hanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has always expected him to be He had receptions for yards and a TD last week The Eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so itll be a challenge Philadelphia ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Should be a tough game Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Dallas Passing Game vs Denver Defense Ryan Leaf did little to impress anyone Sunday with a yard TD Interception game I cant get excited about anyone on this offense Joey Galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but its pretty bleak overall Denver ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and that doesnt help any Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Mark Brunell is looking very iffy again and itll likely be Jonathon Quinn again Has there ever been a good QB named Jonathon Thats bad news for the Jaguar WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell although both played decent last week With Fred Taylor out again Baltimore should have a field day The Ravens rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Id shy away from these guys unless I had few options Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jay Fiedler looked lost last week throwing for yards TDs and Interceptions Hell have his up and down games but he seems to be settling back more toward the downside His WR corps is solid with James McKnight Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers but its hard to put a lot of faith in Fiedler I do like Chambers and his big play ability Buffalo has been tough lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Its actually not so much an issue of them being tough as it is teams just dont need to throw to beat them Regardless offenses havent been putting up a lot of yards on them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense A typical Steve McNair week Major questions all week as to whether hell be healthy enough to play Guts it out through the game rushing for more yards than George throwing for yards and TD It might win NFL games but that probably wont carry your FF team Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are both decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his best receiver The Steelers bring a great defense though ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs not to mention the fact theyve logged sacks over the last games Tough matchup here Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to infoterms

your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Atlantas Maurice Smith vs Carolina Defense Smith was upstaged last week by big Bob Christian who looked great on the TD pass reception and run Smith had yards on carries ypc Keep an eye on his health as he was nicked in Sundays game Smith has been up and down but facing this Carolina defense may be what he needs The Panthers are ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If youve been thinking about starting Smith this could be the week Green Bays Ahman Green vs Detroit Defense Ahman Green was semi quiet running the ball against Atlanta last week carring times for yards ypc Hell face a soft defense this week against the Lions Detroit ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Greens a sure starter here San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Arizona Defense Everyone keeps talking about the rookie wall and Tomlinson just keeps plugging Sunday he posted yards on carries ypc plus a TD Not bad This week he faces the soft Cardinal defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If Tomlinsons been your guy Id certainly start him again here Seattles Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense Alexander continues to have a bulldog like hold on the starting RB job Coach Mike Holmgren is now softening his stance on Ricky Watters return saying Watters might be the rd down back when he returns But even that seems to be a couple of weeks away Alexander is the man Hell face a Chief defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Alexander has to be licking his chops though at their ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimores Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense Brookins did a nice job last week against Cleveland carrying the ball times for yards ypc Id expect him to improve each week as he gets more comfortable in the role of RB He didnt catch any passes so thats a little bit of a worry This week he faces a Jacksonville Defense that did a pretty good against Jerome Bettis last week They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Watch very closely how the team and self appointed spokesman Shannon Sharpe handle the Elvis Grbac interceptions thing Could lead to a more conservative gameplan with a focus on running the ball more Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Cleveland Defense Corey Dillon showed last week why he gets saddled with the inconsistency rep carries for yards ypc wont carry your team The sad thing is hes so hard to predict when hell break out This week he faces a Cleveland Defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so youd have to think he has a chance The Browns rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs as well Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Minnesota Defense Thomas didnt make much noise last week with just yards on carries ypc Fantasy owners are trying to decide who the real Thomas is This week hell face a soft Viking defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs I think well see him get back on track The Bear passing game will definitely open up some lanes for him Miamis Lamar Smith vs Buffalo Defense The Lamar Smith woes continue He showed glimpses of breaking out but wound up with yards on carries ypc Im not as worried about Travis Minor stealing too much from him as he only managed yards on carries ypc This Miami running game has faded quickly Theyll face a soft Buffalo defense this week that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Yorks Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Oakland Defense Barber looked very good Monday while Dayne was awful Barber rushed times for yards plus he caught passes for yards Dayne on the other hand rushed times for a whopping minus ypc NEGATIVE ypc The Raider defense isnt much ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this is probably a good matchup At least for Barber Id start Dayne at your own risk until he shows me something New Orleans Ricky Williams vs New England Defense Start Ricky Williams Hes rolling yards on carries ypc plus another receiving The reemergence of QB Aaron Brooks is a huge factor and Ricky should keep it up New England ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but I wouldnt let that deter me at all San Franciscos Garrison Hearst Kevan Barlow vs Indianapolis Defense Hearst continued the miracle story with another fine outing last week He had yards on carries plus he caught passes for yards He looks to be too much for Kevan Barlow to overtake at this point Barlow did have carries but it looks pretty clear that Hearst is the guy The Colt defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Tampa Bay Defense You dont need me to tell you to start Faulk Just do it and count your blessings that you own one of the best players in the universe Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman vs San Diego Defense Pittman ran pretty hard last week gaining yards on carries ypc but yielded a TD to Thomas Jones last week Thats not good This Charger defense is definitely one that can be run on as they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They dont give up many points though as evidenced by their ranking for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Arizona offense was clicking last week albeit against Detroit but its a little unclear as to exactly how Pittman fits in Carolinas Richard Huntley vs Atlanta Defense Huntley was much more involved this past week and showed his owners some signs of life He rushed times for yards ypc and also caught passes Encouraging signs This week he faces a Falcon defense that could be primed for a letdown after the big Green Bay win They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Denver Defense Emmitt actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to post yards on carries ypc He was nicked late in the game so check his status this week but he looks like hell be ok for Thursdays game The Broncos rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but are still pretty strong for the year ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Denvers Mike Anderson vs Dallas Defense Anderson posted a whopping yards on carries ypc against the Redskins last week Olandis Gary didnt do any better with yards on carries ypc At this point youd have to say the entire Bronco offense is in disarray WR Rod Smiths injury is a huge factor as theyre simply not the same with him less than This week they face a pretty good defense in Dallas that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Being a short week will not help matters Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs San Francisco Defense Dominic Rhodes didnt make anyone forget about Edgerrin James but he did prove what we all were thinking Being the RB for Indy is not a bad thing He got the score and also rolled up yards on carries And hell likely improve Not bad for a guy who probably wasnt drafted in your league The er defense is average ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense After a bye week of rest Holmes will see how he fares against the Seahawk defense Seattle ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Theyre nothing special but they do a nice job of shutting down Travis Henry and Buffalo last week Oaklands Charlie Garner Tyrone Wheatley vs New York Giants Defense Everyone including me hoped that Charlie Garner would take advantage of the opportunity with Wheatley out to show he could be a full time RB Just didnt happen Now Wheatley is reportedly back and ready to go and Garner looks to keep running it between the s while Wheatley or Zack Crockett punch it in at the goalline Garner still puts the yards up though Sunday he rushed for yards and caught another The Giants defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and showed last night they can be vulnerable Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Philadelphia Defense Stephen Davis continues to roll up the yards Last week he totaled yards on carries ypc This week he faces a decent Eagle defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tony Banks will likely be back at QB although Kent Graham did fine Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Buffalos Travis Henry Larry Centers vs Miami Defense Travis Henry looked pretty bad last week carries for yards ypc just isnt going to cut it for you Throwing fumbles on top of that could put his playing time in jeopardy Sammy Morris and Shawn Bryson are champing at the bit Dont forget about Larry Centers He had yards receiving on passes Sunday and those are likely valuable stats in your league The Dolphin Defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so itll be no cakewalk Clevelands James Jackson Ben Gay vs Cincinnati Defense Jackson was a late scratch from Sundays game and Ben Gay made the most of his opportunity You gotta love this guy Hes a very hard runner and while raw displayed some nice talent Im guessing Gays play will be the best rehab Jackson could ever receive Jackson is reportedly ready to go against Cincinnati this week The Bengals are pretty tough against the run ranking For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Englands Antowain Smith vs New Orleans Defense Smith struggled against the Rams Sunday night with yards on carries ypc Id expect tough going again this week against the Saints that rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New England seems to be coming back to earth a bit and you know the Tom Brady Drew Bledsoe thing has to be a distraction for the team Philadelphias Duce Staley vs Washington Defense Any worries Duce Staley owners had about Correll Buckhalter stealing time went up in smoke last week sorry Staley looked like the Duce of old rolling up yards on carries He threw in receptions for yards to boot Washington is surprisingly tough against the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks It wont be a cakewalk but still you have to like Staley with the way theyre playing now Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense Bettis was held very much in check last week with the exception of one yard run Even with the big run his totals of yards on carries ypc werent much Wont be much easier this week against a good Tennesee defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks The Titans shut down Corey Dillon last week who has a similar power style Id have a hard time not starting Bettis though as hes definitely the focus of this offense and getting better as QB Kordell Stewart continues to improve Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Detroits James Stewart Lamont Warren Corey Schlesinger vs Green Bay Defense Talk about a muddy situation Last week Lamont Warren Corey Schlesinger and Rueben Droughns each had at least carries And just for good measure James Stewart is reportedly ready to play this week Throw in the added bonus that Green Bay is very tough and ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Thats enough to make me shy away from all these guys That and the fact Charlie Batch may throw it times Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense As we told our readers today the news isnt good for Fred Taylor His doc is telling him to stay out of the lineup for this week and theyre sounding way too vague for my liking as to when hell be back That probably means Mack gets the call by default He posted a stellar yard on rushes ypc day Yes ZERO point Elvis Joseph can run back kicks but he only managed yards on his carries And QB Mark Brunell could miss the game with his leg injury All in all pretty ugly going against the Ravens Defense whos fallen down to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but is still nasty Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Chicago Defense Bennett got the carries Monday night while Doug Chapman saw no action Bennett had yards on carries ypc so youd have to think hes on the right track back When Culpepper Moss and Carter play like they did Monday its pretty clear the Vikings wont need a lot from their RB This week hell face a much tougher opponent in Chicago The Bears rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and are playing very well For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so itll be a tough matchup coming off a short week Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs St Louis Defense Dunn and Alstott put up pitiful numbers Sunday Dunn had yards on carries ypc Alstott had yards on carries ypc although he did get a score Granted it was against a tough Chicago team but thats awful This week theyll face an injury riddled St Louis team that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Even with the injuries I dont like either of these RBs here Tennessees Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense Its bad when the QB out rushes the RB but thats what happened last week George put up yards on carries ypc and seemed to take a step back The trouble with him is that his game is so power oriented that when the holes arent there he simply cant do much This week itll be much tougher against the swarming Steeler defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Im not one for benching your best players but this is one matchup youll want to look at very closely Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to follow Joe Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to infoterms
<25704299.1075861325058.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-19 18:51:20,Footballguys Update Week Upgrade DowngradeHi Folks Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this weeks Updgrades and Downgrades Enjoy Joe Upgrades QB Aaron Brooks Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and Brooks fantasy owners must be ecstatic Brooks has scored multiple touchdowns in of the last weeks and I expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the season With an easier schedule and better decision making Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks Willie Jackson and breakout tight end Boo Williams QB Jeff Garcia Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers He has thrown for or more touchdowns in of the last games I wouldnt bench Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now He is a stud QB Charlie Batch Batchs yard touchdown performance deserves recognition However I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for the winless Lions A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as Green Bay Chicago Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule QB Rich Gannon A strong performance on Sunday with yards and touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the AFC With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic Gannon will continue to post good numbers for the remainder of the season QB Kurt Warner Warner looked good on Sunday night with yards and touchdowns More importantly he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb injury that has been nagging him throughout the season As always keep Warner in your starting lineup QB Jake Plummer Plummer looked good on Sunday with passing yards and touchdowns Keep in mind this performance was against the hapless Lions Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks against San Diego and Oakland Plummer might be a good option for playoff weeks as he faces Dallas in week and Carolina in week RB Shaun Alexander Plain and simple Alexander produces when he is in the lineup He scored his th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly cleared yards once again Look for Alexander to remain the starter once Watters returns from injury RB Duce Staley Staley continues to look better and better The total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the second half of the season Philadelphias offense and a rock solid defense will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games With Correll Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana Staley will not lose many carries to Buckhalter RB Warrick Dunn Dunn managed just yards rushing against a solid Bears defense but a catch yard receiving performance helps vault him into the upgrades section More importantly it appears that Dunn has returned to after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries RB Garrison Hearst Hearst nearly reached the yard plateau once again He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend for the remainder of the season The ers offense continues to look good and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of starting running backs in the league RB Ricky Williams The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient With Brooks making wise decisions the offense will continue to get better and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams Williams has topped the yard mark in consecutive weeks Look for this trend to continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the season WR Marty Booker The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield and Bookers statistics were directly affected He burned the Buccaneers for long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy Look for more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season With teams starting to sell out to the run Booker and Miller should connect on some play action pass touchdowns WR Joe Horn Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with catches for yards on Sunday With Aaron Brooks making wiser decisions the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the board Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners it is good news for Horn Ricky Williams and Willie Jackson WR Jerry Rice With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from defenses Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field The career touchdown leader added more to his total on Sunday and made it look rather easy With the Oakland offense looking good Rice should continue to see scoring chances A good option for a rd wide receiver in your lineup WR Peerless Price With catches and yards receiving on Sunday Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo With Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams Price has quietly scored touchdowns on the season Price is a talented receiver and should continue to score a touchdown every other week WR Hines Ward Ward has amassed catches in his last games He has only scored two touchdowns on the season but his reception and yardage numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis Ive never been a big fan of the Steelers passing game but Ward deserves consideration for active duty on a weekly basis WR David Boston Bostons yard game streak ended this week Fantasy owners had to settle for yards receiving and touchdowns Look for Boston to continue to put up quality numbers Downgrades QB Brian Griese The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little bit heading into Sundays game so I was not surprised by Grieses poor performance on Sunday With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for the year Grieses receiving options were limited and his production was directly affected You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is healthy However the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving QB Tim Couch Couch threw interceptions and was held to passing yards against a stingy Ravens defense Couch should be considered a quality keeper quarterback but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent quarterback for the remainder of this season Couch should do well against Cincinnati and Jacksonville but struggle against New England Green Bay and Pittsburgh QB Mark Brunell An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup this week With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week it may be best to start someone else this week QB Elvis Grbac Grbac looked horrible with interceptions on Sunday The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw touchdown passes The schedule looks favorable for Grbac but he is struggling which concerns me QB Tony Banks Banks suffered a concussion in Sundays game against Denver The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and then taken off the field on a stretcher QB Jay Fiedler Fiedler threw interceptions and touchdowns on Sunday Unfortunately Fiedlers two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense The up and down season for Fiedler continues With games against Buffalo Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule Fiedler should still be considered a quality spot starter RB Eddie George George was held to yards on carries Sunday He has yet to break the yard barrier in a game this season I guess the toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most anticipated Although we can blame the toe injury two other factors have meant the demise of George this season First the loss of lead back Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes Finally the Titans offensive line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons RB Anthony Thomas Thomas was held under yards for the second consecutive game With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout the remainder of the season Keep in mind the Bears last two opponents Green Bay and Tampa Bay are two of the better defenses against the run in the league With Tampa Bay Green Bay Minnesota and Detroit on the schedule for the remainder of the season expect Thomas stats to be up and down RB Lamar Smith With rushing yards on carries Smith continues to struggle This marks the th consecutive game that Smith has been held yardscarry Dont be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger role in the running game RB Travis Henry Henry continues to struggle He managed just yards on carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble A running back can not be productive with just carries Keep him on your bench WR Rod Smith Suffering from an ankle injury Smith was limited to yards on three catches He did manage to score a touchdown Smiths ankle injury deserved your attention The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines late in the th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the field and tie the ball game The short week will not help Smiths status on Thanksgiving Day WR Eric Moulds The disappointing season for Moulds continues He was held to yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained on the other side of the field Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills at this point WR Wayne Chrebet A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on Sunday Testaverde and the passing game isnt looking very good at this point You may want to bench Chrebet until he is healthy WR Todd Pinkston Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list Heck I like the guy and think he could become special However he remains to do what is neededproduce on a consistent basis WR Muhsin Muhammad Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable to play in the second half against San Francisco Heck his production was not missed Its pretty difficult to miss little to no production if you know what I mean If youre a Muhammad owner you know what I mean WR Reggie Wayne Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status is not yet known He has yet to do anything special this season but his expectations were fairly high so Ill downgrade him Waiver Wire Keep in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and team leagues QB Alex Van Pelt Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on Sunday with passing yards and two touchdowns He has a talented receiving crew with Moulds Price and Riemersma As long as he can get pass protection his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in need of a quarterback RB Ben Gay Gay was the feature back on Sunday with carries for yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense No other running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense Gay may just be that guy RB Amos Zeroue Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the Browns Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against Jacksonville If you have Jerome Bettis on your team Zeroue deserves a roster spot If not you may want to take a flyer on this guy The Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers RB Lamont Jordan Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue If Curtis Martin gets injured Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality numbers Not a bad option if you can spare a roster spot If you have Curtis Martin get Lamont Jordan WR JJ Stokes Stokes looked good on Sunday with yards and a touchdown This marks the second consecutive game with yards With the ers looking good in the passing game a healthy Stokes could be a decent spot starter WR Keith Poole Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the Redskins However he continues to learn the offense and should start producing very shortly Pooles effectiveness will most likely occur with a healthy Rod Smith garnering doubletriple teams on the opposite side of the field TE Boo Williams Boo has me excited about his potential Hes a big fast tight end with good hands Plain and simple he has big play potential and should produce in the Saints offense Bryant

sees for this weeks Upgrades and Downgrades Enjoy Joe Upgrades QB Tom Brady Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the return of Drew Bledsoe from injury Some analysts may question the fact that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury but no one can question Bradys effectiveness on the football field A yard touchdown performance keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter Keep in mind the Patriots have a bye in week QB Kordell Stewart Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second consecutive multiple touchdown game Stewart finished the game with passing yards rushing yards and total touchdowns The schedule looks good for Stewart down the stretch especially with games against Detroit and Cincinnati in weeks and QB Jay Fiedler Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris Chambers Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season but his upside is good A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats QB Alex Van Pelt Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson Van Pelt has been a fantasy star With two consecutive yards games to match with touchdowns Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents Look for another quality performance against the ers this weekend RB Dominic Rhodes With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season Rhodes has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense He produced on Sunday with total yards and touchdowns Two consecutive difficult games against Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down but a strong finish to the season is in store With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions look for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes RB Antowain Smith Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with total yards and touchdowns However now is the time to trade Smith away His value has hit an alltime high and the remainder of the season will be difficult with Cleveland Miami and a bye week remaining RB Ahman Green Green has struggled the last few weeks but was able to bust out on Thanksgiving Day with total yards and scores Look for the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the season As the winter weather approaches Favre and the passing game will become more conservative which will result in more dump off passes to the talented Green Dont be surprised if Green receives touchesgame the remainder of the season RB LaDainian Tomlinson Tomlinsons statistics have suffered over the last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run In order to get the ball in Tomlinsons hands more often Turner called several short passing plays to get LT in the open field The plan was successful as Tomlinson caught passes for yards The fantasy playoffs look good for Tomlinson with Oakland Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks and RB Garrison Hearst Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with rushing yards and touchdowns In the last games Hearst has averaged rushing yardsgame With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on Sunday to go along with an already injured quad Hearst will continue to see touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs as long as he remains healthy WR Derrick Alexander Good news for Alexander ownersit appears that he is healthy for the first time this season WR Eric Moulds Throughout the week Moulds was complaining about the lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him Well the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball What happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds He produced yards and touchdowns WR Chris Chambers The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with receiving yards and fabulous touchdowns Chambers is the big play threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action Keep in mind Chambers is a boombust option at receiver Hell dazzle you one week and disappear the next week This guy is going to be special so grab him in dynasty leagues WR David Boston Plain and simplethe man A few weeks ago the knock on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring Well touchdowns in weeks should quiet the critics WR Kevin Johnson Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday with yards and a touchdown Johnson is Tim Couchs clear cut receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the season WR Troy Brown Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent basis With catches for yards and a touchdown on Sunday Brown continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady Keep in mind New England has a bye in week so Brown will not be available for the majority of championship games Plan accordingly Downgrades QB Trent Green Greens disappointing season continues He looked good with passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday However he was unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade With the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver Greens stock could be on the rise in the near future Greens value is at its lowest point so you could probably get him for relatively cheap Hes not an every week starter but he might have a few big games left for this season QB Donovan McNabb McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the last two weeks passing yards and touchdown His pride of wanting to be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production McNabbs value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some plays Right now McNabb should still be considered a top fantasy quarterback However if his lack of production continues his stock will drop quickly QB Brian Griese Grieses receiving options are limited which is directly affecting his production Rod Smith limped through Thursdays game with an ankle injury A healthy return of Smith will boost Grieses stock However Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver position His production is limited if he is forced to throw to the tight end position the majority of the time QB Daunte Culpepper Culpepper did not passscore a touchdown for the first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week RB Anthony Thomas Thomas was held out of Sundays game with a hamstring injury Hes expecting to play this weekend against Detroit but this is not a guarantee With James Allen being effective it would not surprise me to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs A big game looms in two weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that game RB Emmitt Smith Smith was held to yards on carries during the Thanksgiving Day game Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game Smiths numbers will remain meager RB Ron Dayne With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option in the rushing game Daynes fantasy value has dropped very low Dayne had yards on carries Barber had rushing yards on carries receptions for yards and a touchdown Keep Dayne on your bench RB Jason Brookins Brookins broke his foot in Sundays game against the Jaguars He is expected to be out for weeks Drop him and add someone else to the roster RB Eddie George Georges disappointing season continues with yards on carries this past Sunday George is currently tied with Randy Moss for Fantasy Disappointment of the Year RB Maurice Smith Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to return to the game However Smith gained a meager yards on carries and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain Evaluate his progress later this week WR Jimmy Smith Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after being pulled over by police No legal action will occur but some sort of suspension could be handed down by the commissioners office Not a good sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs WR Peter Warrick Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland on Sunday He was held to reception for yards and has not scored a touchdown since week of the season Keep him on your bench until the Cincinnati passing game reappears WR Randy Moss Moss was held to yards on catches Sunday night Moss is the most talented receiver in the league but appears to lose concentration from time to time Keep in mind his potential for explosive games is enormous Waiver Wire Keep in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and team leagues QB Alex Van Pelt Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson Van Pelt has been a fantasy star With two consecutive yards games to match with touchdowns Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents RB James Allen Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and performed admirably With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury its highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this weekend Chicagos defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on the ground RB Travis Minor With Lamar Smith averaging just ydscarry over the last games Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon In his limited touches Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a much needed spark WR Chris Chambers This guy is good See description in upgrades section TE Eddie Boo Williams I had Williams on the list last week and his play on Sunday deserves another mention Although he had just catches for yards Williams has explosive potential He nearly scored on a yard pass play but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury Williams is a tight end with quality upside Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo

<21150800.1075854650130.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2000-11-29 15:40:00,cheatsheets Passing Game Matchups Week Hi Folks First off congratulations on a great seasonI assume if youre still in the hunt this late in the year you have to call a successful campaign Enjoy it Its an intense time and you cant slack off n ow but its also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens in t he next few weeks Its tough enough just to get to this point Great w ork From my perspective its interesting in that the actual number of folks who read the material drops way off this time of year But the other side of the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading shoots throu gh the roof There may not be as many folks reading as there were in September but the ones that are here are into in a big way Ill do my dead level best to keep up my end of the bargain and provide the best info I can all the way to the week games Lets get at it Joe Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Passing Game Matchups Heres how I see the matchups this week Please note see the cheatsheet online will be availablelate Wednesday evening atweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be mor e favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more too l in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software f or more info The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position numbers are from ESPNcom Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Bronco Defense I stuck my neck out a bit last week with QB Aaron Brooks but he came though for me This week he draws a great matchup with a Denver defense thats not been able to sto p anyone through the air Over the last four weeks they rank in passi ng yards allowed per game Denver has averaged giving up yards passing p er game over that span With CB Ray Crockett out with a torn hamstring Jim my Spencer will fill in for him again this week He and Terrell Buckley can definitely be beaten Brooks will focus on WR Joe Horn his primary weapon but Willie Jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option RB Chad Morton catches the ball pretty well out of the backfield TE Aaron Glove r still is total non factor for Fantasy purposes Im doing my best to not get carried away with Brooks Keep telling yourself the young man has exactly games of NFL experience On the other hand there comes a time when you take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes This gu y isnt playing like a game rookie and the Denver defense is awful St Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense I want to believe I believe in Kurt Warner and I believe hell get his Rams back on track As much as anything I believe youll see Marshall Faulk at least see more action than he saw last week Warners an MVP but I think its Faulk that make s this team go He creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commi t safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game If the defense plays the pass then Faulk can kill them with the run or short passes After last week Id be shocked if coach Mike Martz doesnt get back to utilizinghisstar RBmore Kurt Warner makes his return and I m guessing he picks up where he left off Thats not what youd expec t to happen but Warners made a career of exceeding expectations If he s on your roster I think you have to go with him Especially against this defense Carolina ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For WRs its always tough to pick Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are the sure guys but honestly Ricky Proehls been on fire lately AzZahir Hakim is always worth a shot too Any one of these guy s can go off TE Roland Williams suffers with so many good receivers but he s a decent producer too Atlanta Passing Game vs Seattle Defense This one is a pure matchup play as Dan Reeves makes the move for startingQB Doug Johnson over the fading Chris Chandler Im not a big fan of either but if you find yourself f aced with the prospect of starting a Falcon QB this is the week to do it if yo u re ever going to The Seahawks defense is less like a hawk and more like an albatross around Mike Holmgrens neck Theyre awful Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Good luck picki ng the WR as Terrance Mathis has been invisible lately while Shawn Jefferson is making a resurgence A few weeks ago it was Mathis who was hot while Jefferson faded If you made me pick one Id reluctantly go with Jefferson TE Reggie Kelly did catch passes Sunday but Im not count ing on him for too much Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Raider Defense KorDELLKorDELLKorDE LL What brought this guy back to life I dunno but you can bet coach Bill Cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling Kordell Stewar t looks to be playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much o f the game at this level is mental No one ever doubted his physical skills The obvious spark seems to have been the benching of WR Plaxico Burress and the inspired play of Hines Ward I think its ironic that W ard was very much a Kordelllike Slash player in college at Georgia Bobby Shaw is getting into the act and producing from the WR slot and wonders of wonders TE Mark Bruener caught a TD Sunday You know things are changin g when Bruener gets in the endzone The Raiders are an extremely good football team but stopping teams through the air is their Achilles heel Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Another interesting aspect o f writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December ar e stocked with the obvious stars QB Scott Mitchell likely doesnt fall into that star category and I doubt many folks are faced with the decis ion to start him this week but if hes your best QB this might be your lucky week First of all lets assume he gets the knee ready to go This e arly in the week thats honestly a shaky assumption Well know more l ater But if he can go he could do some damage against an awful Cardinal defense WR Peter Warrick could be a decent play too although Aeneas Williams is a solid cover guy Hes hard to count out though just beca use of his home run ability Funny how I dont see many people complaining about his times now RB Corey Dillon is the only other starter on this team but well catch up with him in the rushing Matchups Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Lets be clear Im no Jake Plummer fan but the truth of the matter is hes got a pretty decent matc hup this week Hes reportedly making good progress and should start Sunda y Partly because hes better partly because Dave Brown was just awful Worse than Plummer has a nasty ring to it But this Bengal pa ss defense is pretty bad Over the past four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game WRs David Boston has the physical tools to do some damage and Frank Sanders has the experience to make an impact Remember this is the unit that made Pittsburgh look like the Rams last week New York Jets Passing Game vs Colts Defense The Jets have been up and do wn a bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling Indianapolis defense The pathetic Colt pass rush only has sacks in th e last games QB Vinny Testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup with yards and TD WR Wayne Chrebets been in a funk lately but in their week he went off catching passes for Sure some of it was late but garbage stats count too Dedric Ward caught just yards worth of passes but he scored in that game Hes come on lately after fadin g early Rookie WR Laveranues Coles will miss another game it appears RB Curtis Martin still is struggling to get healthy and that will hurt a little TE Anthony Becht is a bright spot as hes beginning to contrib ute December in New York will make a difference to this soft Colt team which doesnt play as well in the cold Detroit Passing Game vs Viking Defense Charlie Batch continued to look good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his well deserved candybone label with a gutsy performance on Thanksgiving His ribs are reportedly better and he had a nice practice Tuesday throwing the ball The Viking secondary could have matchup troubles with WRs Johnnie Morton a nd Herman Moore Over the last four weeks Minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs The Vikings are tough on TEs ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to TEs for the year but TE David Sloan has played very well of late He ranks in Fantasy Points among TEs over the last games and is well worth a start here Denver Passing Game vs Saints Defense For all the hype generated by New Orleans defense they give up tons of yards passing Over the last fo ur weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game They do sack the QB a ton over the last four weeks but they still give up the yards I t s kind of unusual to see that Theyll be facing Gus Frerotte and a Den ver team thats trying to find their way Frerottes been up and down after his monster week game The Saints continue to drop like flies and the loss of CB Fred Weary will definitely hurt Both WRs Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey are solid plays as always And as crazy as it sounds either one of the headed TE monster in Dwayne Carswell and Desmond Clark are decen t options too Byron Chamberlain normally makes it a headed TE monster bu t hes nursing a bad Achilles tendon and didnt play last week As no ted above Denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a hig h scoring affair I doubt you could have predicted a shootout between Aaron Brooks and Gus Frerotte months ago but thats why they play the games Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Chicago Passing Game vs Packer Defense Im torn here You probably saw how weak the Packer defense looked Monday night They couldnt do muc h of anything But on the other hand the Bears will likely go with Shane Matthews and hes been just awful lately Like worse than Dave Brown kind of bad One would think hed improve against this defense but hell have to make great strides just to get reach average Owners of WR Marcus Robinson feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately wit h Matthews at the helm Still though theres some hope On a brighter spot Matthews does seem comfortable throwing to Eddie Kennison who had passes thrown to him Sunday compared to Robinsons Ive hear rum ors that Chicago may start a TE but that news is unconfirmed at this time In t he for real rumor department QB Cade McNown is making noise about wanting to start this week but I think its still a week early New England Passing Game vs Chief Defense Kansas City and New England ar e two once proud teams that are struggling This week a banged up Drew Bledsoefaces a pass defense thats been vulnerable Over the last fou r weeks Kansas City ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year KC ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs Bledsoe bruised a knee in Thursdays game but played through it and should be o k Keep an eye on him though as he was added to the injury report this week a s Questionable As long as Bledsoe plays WR Terry Glennshould be a good option as hes clearly the guy in that offense over Troy Brown TE Rod Rutledge caught passes last week so he may start to make some noise With all those productive years throwing to Ben Coates you know Bledsoe would love to have a solid TE Carolina Passing Game vs Rams Defense Even if you want to pin Carolina s Monday Night performance on a weak Green Bay defense credit still must be given to Steve Beuerleinand the Panthers The immobile Beuerlein hung in there and delivered Hes facing a Rams defense that even with Bud Car sons help still ranks in passing yards allowed per game Granted that s a big improvement Beuerleins numbers may be helped by the return of Ram QB Kurt Warner as theres nothing like the other team rolling up points to get your QBs arm loose WR Muhsin Muhammad had the dominating game we all know he can and looked overpowering The hamstring injury was supposed to be with him all year but he looks good to me Another boost for Beuerlein will be if WR Donald Hayescan get back on the field as early reports are hoping for Even TE Kris Mangumbe the one guy in your leag ue that doesnt say magnum like the gun has been looking good For the year St Louis ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the TE so he could be worth a shot Jacksonville Passing Game vs Browns Defense This one really is a case of misdirection as QB Mark Brunellisnt as good as many people think and the Browns pass defense isnt as bad as most people assume Cleveland rank s in passing yards allowed per game And for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs which really surprises people The reason is that their rush defense is awful and teams choose to run instead But all you really care about are the stats Brunell should be ok but not great here as the Jaguars look to take out a seasons worth of frustrat ions on the Browns Jimmy Smithand Keenan McCardellare solid choices as usual Even the much maligned by me anyway rookie R Jay Sowardproduc ed last week Soward could actually be bad news for McCardell and Smith as there were times when Brunell really seemed to force the ball his way T E Kyle Bradyis solid But honestly I think this will be the Fred Taylor on the ground show against a weak rush unit Washington Passing Game vs Giant Defense Brad Johnsonmakes his return this week taking over for Jeff George Its interesting to watch how t he Redskins spin this transition According to Washington Johnson starting has nothing to do with Jeff Georges less than spectacular play or reco rd Johnson was the starter all along regardless of how George played yada yada This type of talk makes it easier to sell the fans Jeff Geor ge as the starting QB next year Well see for the record Im a George fan and have been for a while Myself and other guys are pretty much it Like most players in this could go either way category Johnson has good and bad points this week On the upside the Giants defense has shown itself to be vulnerable to the pass The Redskins also hope to have RB Stephen Davisthis week His presence does a great deal for the passing game On the downside Johnson will likely be rusty He may still be feeling some lingering effects of the injury Secondly his best WR Albert Connellmay play but hes nowhere near full speed James Thrashfilled in admirably for Connell and looks to be a good play this wee k as well It looks like Irving Fryarwill get the start opposite Thrash The ageless wonder might do something if Jason Sehorn stays with Thrash as Dave Thomas is by far the weaker CB TE Stephen Alexanderis a steady performer although FB Larry Centerssteals too many of the short passes th at could go to Alexander New York Giant Passing Game vs Redskin Defense A good defense takes on a good passing offense I guess thats why this matchup is in this colu mn Over the last four weeks Washington ranks in passing yards allowed p er game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing Q Bs so theyre pretty tough QB Kerry Collinshas quietly played extremely well over the last month Hes thrown for yards and TDs over the last games That puts him at in Fantasy Points among QBs over that time span WR Amani Toomercontinues to play great football and is definitely worth a shot Joe Jureviciusfills in for the injured Ike Hilliard again and hes a solid choice as Collins didnt hesitate to throw him the ball often TE Pete Mitchell is tough to depend on as he gets more catches but Dan Campbellgrabs the TDs it seems Im not too excited about ei ther guy San Diego Passing Game vs er Defense My Charger buddies have cautioned me about jumping on the Ryan LeafBandwagon That was right after Id se nt a group email at halftime of the SD KC game to some friends boasting about my QB Leaf Of course we know the nd half didnt go quit e as well as the first and I came back to reality But theres some truth to the i dea Leaf is becoming an NFL QB I personally had doubts if wed ever see i t but I think its starting to happen And this week against a San Francisc o defense he could make some more strides It should be noted the ers ar e much better on pass defense than they had been Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game which is a huge upgrade from where they had been For the year though they still rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Leaf has some extremely solid receivers TE Freddie Jonesis his best target but veteran WRs Jeff Graha m and Curtis Conwayare more than capable Youd think that San Francis co will score some points so there could be some fireworks Id shy away f rom Leaf but Jones in particular could be a very nice play San Francisco Passing Game vs Charger Defense The Charger defense held Kansas City down last week but I think that had more to do with Warren Moo n s senior citizen status than it did the Charger D Granted theyre improving but I think San Francisco should be able to move the ball Ove r the last four weeks San Diego ranks in passing yards allowed per game QB Jeff Garciais coming off a bye week and should be rested and prepared His biggest problem will be the toe injury to WR Terrell Owens Owens was unable to complete practice Monday and its now looking like it could be later this week before he sees the practice field Coach Steve Mariucci didnt sound too optimistic Although I can imagine worse scenarios for a WR than having Jerry Riceas your best WR Owens will definitely be missed but JJ Stokesand Tai Streetswill fill in just fine There had been some talk from Mariucci about resting Garcia to see how the rookie QBs Gio Carmazzi and Tim Rattay would fare in game situations I think this is just talk at this point I dont really see the Chargers blowing out San Francisco to the point Garcia could be pulled If Garcia gets San Francisco such a lead that he could be pulled he would have probably earned a great day of stats by then anyway At least for this week Im thinking hell be fine in the playing time department Minnesota Passing Game vs Lion Defense Ok this is tough matchup for the Vikings Detroit ranks in passing yards allowed per gameover the last four games But the Lions are dealing with several injuries in their secondary including Safety Ron Rice leg probable Kurt Schulz ankledoubtful and nickel back Marquis Walker wristout Still though youre crazy if you dont start QB Daunte Culpepperand WRs Randy M ossand Cris Carter Theyre just too good Kansas City Passing Game vs Patriot Defense Its early to make a call but its looking like QB Elvis Grbacwill be back this week Thats gr eat news for Chief fans and Fantasy Owners The Patriots rank in passing yar ds allowed per game over the last four weeks but those numbers are a little skewed as Detroit Cincinnati Cleveland and Buffalo were the opponents Its not like they shut down the Rams or ers Grbac will look to ge t his target TE Tony Gonzalezback on track after he was shut out by the Chargers I dont think youll see that again with Grbac under cent er WR Derrick Alexanderis an excellent target too Rookie Sylvester Morrisseems to be fading instead of getting better He may be hitting th e infamous rookie wall Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Dallas Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith seems recovered from his knockout slap Thursday and says hell start That s good news for all aspects of the Dallas offense QB Troy Aikmansquares off again st a Tampa defense thats bark is worse than its bite Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Although they have registered sacks over that span which is towards the top of the league Theyre solid though WRs Wayne McGarityand James McKnighta re showing theyre not anything exceptional TE Jackie Harriswas injure d last week and David LaFluerwoke up with a great game Cleveland Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense One has to ask if anyone really cares whether QBsDoug Pedersonor Spergon Wynngets the majority of the snaps I think I can say fairly confidently that neither of these guys ha ve been figuring heavily into your plans The Jaguar defense has improved significantly of late They rank in passing yards allowed per gameover the last four weeks and they should be plenty good enough to contain the Browns This team never really had a chance once Tim Couch an d Errict Rhett went down Kevin Johnsonand David Patten handle the WR duties but I cant advocate either with a clear conscience TE AaronSh ea will start for the Browns but probably not for your FF Team Green Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense Its hard to know what to thin k about Green Bay One game they look like the Packers of old with Favre working his magic and the next they look like a shell of their former selves as they did on Monday Night against a Carolina team that had no business handling them as they did Brett Favreis still a decent bet t o sling a few TDs on any Sunday but hes sadly become just an average Fan tasy QB Lately the Bears have been tough against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Although for th e year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Favre will have the very disappointing Antonio Freemanto throw to although Bil l Schroederis putting up better numbers the last few weeks He has another advantage in that while Freeman will likely draw CB Thomas Smith Schroede r likely goes against Jerry Azumah Remember Schroeder came up huge in the week matchup with TDs in the th quarter For a TE Id go with Bu bba Franksalthough whenever I say that it seems Tyrone Daviscatches a TD Seattle Passing Game vs Falcon Defense This is an interesting game as tw o proud coaches in Dan Reeves and Mike Holmgren lead teams that are floundering The one bright spot for the Falcons is that theyve yield ed few yards passing although the glass is half empty crowd will poin t out that the reason for that is the weak rush defense Why throw the ball whe n you can run on Atlanta Regardless of the reason teams dont throw mu ch against the Falcons and I dont look for QB Jon Kitnato completely bre ak that trend Hell be looking to quiet producers Sean Dawkinsand Derric k Mayes Dawkins in particular has been exceptional over the last few weeks and is probably worth a start Indianapolis Passing Game vs Jets Defense I love Peyton Manningbut he s a guy that doesnt always post the Fantasy Football numbers to match hi s hype Hes a solid producer wholl very rarely burn you but hes also not too subject to the yard TD day With that said I think youll see another good solid day from him against a Jet defense thats tough Ov er the last four weeks New York ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Manning will try to jump start his team thats floundering a bit The y know they need a win and a team like this can be tough when cornered Im not heeding the grumblings about WR Marvin Harrison Hes fine He ca ught TDs last week and has stated he needs to get on a mission althou gh he needs some help Jerome Pathonhad some horrendous drops EG Greenhopes to be back this week from a knee injury and that will be good news Terrenc e Wilkins and Pathon just arent getting it done TEs Marcus Pollardand Ken Dilgerboth catch just enough to make neither guy very valuable Oakland Passing Game vs Steeler Defense QB Rich Gannonis garnering lots of talk about the league MVP Could be But hes got a tough matchup th is week against a Steeler team playing with confidence Pittsburgh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the seaso n they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB so thats strong WRTim Brownis the clear cut target of choice and that makes thing s great for Brown owners You know hell get his touches Andre Risonand James Jettwill get the scraps left over TE Ricky Dudleyis a guy who you play totally at your own risk Hes just as liable to go catchless as he is score TDs Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Miami Passing Game vs Bills Defense Lets seeJay Fiedlercoming back from a shoulder injury in what will likely be horrible weather conditions against the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Thats what youve got in this game and its e nough to have me looking elsewhere if Ive got Dolphin passing game players I d start who ever you did last week if Fiedler is your QB If you have to start a Miami WR Id roll the dice on the unheralded Leslie Shepherdw hos catching more than anyone thought he would Slim pickings with this matchup after that Buffalo Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense Lets seeRob Johnsoncom ing back from his latest injury in what will likely be horrible weather conditions against the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks This sounds familiar Seriously this game ought to be a defensive struggle as two dominant defenses square off in the snow against mediocre offenses Rob Johnson will get the start but as usual wont finish the game Eric Mouldswill gather the majority of catches and is probably too good not to start just because hes so talented and he doe s grab the lions share of passes thrown TE Jay Reimersmais fast regaining his place as one of the best TEs in the game and depending on the weather here he could be the best receiving choice Philadelphia Passing Game vs Titan Defense Understand that this is a bad matchup for Donovan McNabband the Eagles but so was last week against Washington And all McNabb did was win Offensive Player of the Week honors Outside of McNabb and TE Chad Lewis I cant recommend any oth er players as starters Neither WRsCharles Johnsonor Torrance Smallscare anyone The Titans are an athletic and physical unit that youd think would give McNabb trouble And truthfully the Washington game would have likely been different if spy LaVarr Arrington hadnt been hurt early The lack of a passing game threat really hurts as Tennessee will likely be able to handle the WRs with man coverage and commit more personnel to the run and McNabb Still if hes by far your best QB Id roll the dice with him as hes made a season out of proving people wrong Tennessee Passing Game vs Eagle Defense Steve McNairranks among QB s over the last games in Fantasy Points per game Thats not real solid I dont see him suddenly improving his play against an Eagle defense that ranks in passing yards allowed per game And for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB The Eagles have sacks over the last games and while McNair is tough guy to sack its obvio us the Eagles will pressure him His WR corps in Derrick Masonand Chris Sandersarent the greatest As usual his best option will be TE Fran k Wycheck Wycheck struggled last week with some uncharacteristic drops bu t this week he could be an asset as McNair likely wont have a lot of tim e to throw Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Who knows where the Shaun KingRoller Coaster Ride will take us this week Hes nursing a back s train but practiced Wednesday and looks good to go The Cowboys surprisingly hav e played decent pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game Of course thats largely because no team feels the need to throw the b all when they can run at will King will spread the ball between WRs Keyshaw n Johnsonand Jacquez Green Im not especially excited about either bu t it s very hard to turn your back on Keyshawn TE Dave Mooreis a fine produc er and Id feel comfortable starting him To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

see thecheatsheet onlineweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just becau se one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is mea nt to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Jamal Anderson Atl vs Seahawk Defense If youve learned anything t his season its start RBs facing the Seahawk defense Fo the year they ra nk in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Over the last four week s theyve really tailed off ranking in rushing yards allowed per gam e Theyre playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a statement Warrick Dunn TB vs Cowboy Defense The Cowboys havent gotten any b etter against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For the year theyre ranked in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs Dunns athletic style will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner d id earlier the season Fred Taylor Jac vs Brown Defense Cleveland struggles against most any RB but especially tough physical rushing teams Taylor and the Jaguars fi t that bill This season has seen some rushing performances of historical significance this year You might see another one this week On paper i t s a dream matchup Tyrone Wheatley Oak vs Steeler Defense I know its hard to believe but the numbers show that over the past four weeks Pittsburgh ranks in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre allowing yards rushing on the ground Granted Fred Taylor Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into that number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isnt too far down below thei r class Hes healthier now than he has been in a while Ricky Watters Sea vs Falcon Defense Ive been a Ricky Watters fan since the er days One of the best combinations of rushing and receiving in some time Hes had an age defying season and the roll should continue against a Falcon unit thats been awful defending the run lately For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For th e year theyre in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Eve ryone keeps wondering when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets blown out here which I have hard time seeing I think youll see plent y of Ricky Watters Corey Dillon Cin vs Cardinal Defense Like Fred Taylor vs Cleveland this one looks almost too good to be true on paper They dont always t urn out that way in reality but youve got to be drooling over this game if you re a Dillon owner His running in the lack of a real passing game threat is an amazing feat Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be effective throwing the ball which will help even more Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Tony Richardson Kimble Anders KC vs Patriot Defense Our support o f Christian Okoye last week for a Chief RB didnt garner much support fro m the KC coaching staff so it looks like another week of Richardson Anders Anders actually got plenty of carries last week and promptly did very litt le with them Richardson appears to be the better back right now but who know s how this will play out Its hard for me to advocate either But if y ou do go with one know that theyll be facing a pretty soft New England rush defense that ranks in rushing yards allowed per gameover the last fo ur weeks Tshimanga Biakabutuka Brad Hoover Car vs Rams Defense Biakabutuka found there was no rehabilitation method quite as effective as folk s chanting Hoooooover on Monday night Amazing how that consis tently works Biakabutuka has been upgraded to probable but Im not convinced Hoover just takes his place back on the bench Youll likely see both go The Rams still give up a good bit of yardage on the ground lately averagin g yards per game over the last four weeks That ranks them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB JR Redmond NE vs Chief Defense The Patriots are a tough team to figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny But if he can hold them together Ive got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here Th e Chiefs rank over the past four weeks in rushing yards allowed per gam e For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing R B Keep an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he cant go all bets are off b ut if he can keep the defense honest I like Redmonds chances here Of cour se you have to know the risks that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong way Edgerrin James Ind vs Jets Defense The NFL is the ultimate game of watching to see what others do You can bet the Colts are aware of the success Chicagos James Allen had last week rushing and fumbling the ball against New York I think youll see a steady diet of Edgerrin doing t he same thing hopefully not fumbling though James is a no brainer star t him against virtually any team unless youre so loaded at RB its no t fair Eddie George Ten vs Eagle Defense Philadelphia isnt quite as tough vs the run as their reputation might have you believe Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB But you can pretty much throw those numbers out when its Eddie George Hell ge t his yards the hard way Id be very surprised if you dont see George e xhibit some leadership here and put together a solid effort Curtis Martin NYJ vs Colts Defense It sounds like Curtis Martin is ju st going to have to play with the strained buttocks youve heard enough jokes by now Ill spare you The Indy defense is definitely vulnerable to the rush For the season they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs This game will be in New York and the Colts are soft when it s cold outside so Martin could have an edge James Allen Chi vs Green Bay Lets give Allen the benefit of the d oubt and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced although I didnt see Curtis Martin fumble three times and he was there too If he can fin d the handle on the ball hell be fine as he actually ran very while when he managed to hang on to the football Green Bay proved Monday night they can t stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears and for Allen Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Travis Prentice Jamel White Cle vs Jaguar Defense This is one of those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper Jacksonville has yielded an average of yards rushing per game over the last four weeks That ranks them They also rank for the year i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs But theyre playing better than that now I believe And the Browns are just playing out the season And the bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel White has looked impressive Its a decent matchup for Cleveland but Id probably shy from these guys if it were me Michael Pittman Ari vs Bengal Defense A case of both sides being bette r than what many people think Michael Pittman is a player Since Vince Tobin left its been pretty much Pittmans show on the ground much to the chagrin of Thomas Jones owners And on the other side of the ball the Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for On the ground they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB S o this once could truly go either way Id feel ok with Pittman if he was my guy but I wouldnt be overly excited Robert Smith Min vs Lion Defense This isnt the best matchup in the world for Smith but you have to start him If nothing else than to get an early lead on your opponent with a Thursday night game Cmon that s worth something Seriously Smith is one of the elite RBs right now bu t Detroit is playing pretty tough against the run ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Hes a starter though just play him Ahman Green GB vs Bear Defense Find a nice toasty place to watch this one Chicago in December At night Thats football With Dorsey Lev ens likely gone for the year the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man Chicago has a tough run defense led by all world rookie Brian Urlacher I told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him Vanilla Freak and now youre seeing why I love this kid These guys are professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy with the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature keeps dropping Lamar Smith Mia vs Bills Defense Smith practiced Wednesday and while it s awful early to make a definitive call it looks like hell start Sund ay The Bufallo defense is solid against the rush They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Although for the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Although if Smith can return to his awesome form before the injury hell be a load The Dolphins will rely on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus not that good to begin with Marshall Faulk StL vs Panther Defense Lets hope Faulk gets back to his old form And lets hope the Panther defense gets back more their old rushing defense form Over the last four games Carolina ranks in rushing yards allowed per game But for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB It sounds to me like coach Mi ke Martz wont make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best we apons in Faulk Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Shawn Bryson Sammy Morris Antowain Smith Buf vs Miami Defense Believe it or not the Dolphin Defense ranks just in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Granted of those games don t factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have thought The Bills rushing game is a mess The team is calling Morris ankle questionable so well have to wait and see Bryson has done very little with the opportunity and we know Smith didnt produce or we woul d have never seen so much of Bryson and Morris With a healthy Zach Thomas Id probably shy a bit from any of these guys Emmitt Smith Dal vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith said hed never been knocked out in his career but thats what happened Thursday Hes bo unced back quickly and says hell certainly be the starter Sunday The Bucs are tough but not invincible Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game giving up yards per game on the ground Emmitts made a living running the ball against tough defenses over his career so Im not overly concerned with the matchup Hes a gamer and Id say hes probably a starter for most owners this week even facing Tampa Bay Stephen Davis Was vs Giants Defense Be very leery here Stephen Dav is demonstrated last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of salt Players are notoriously optimistic about their chances for recoveri ng from injury Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I w as sure hed start Id think very hard about going elsewhere this week Its not like hes facing Seattle and this is a dream matchup or something The Giants are tough against the run ranking for the year in Fantasy Point s allowed to the opposing RB So unless you know for sure hes going I d strongly consider my other options Terrell Fletcher SD vs er Defense Fletcher is probable with a rib fracture which must sound worse than it is Either that or hes one tou gh guy The problem is that San Francisco is playing much improved defense lately Against the rush over the last four weeks they rank in rushi ng yards allowed per game Thats a marked contrast to their year long numbers where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Adding Fletchers ribs to the improved Defense I dont see much fro m San Diego on the ground Sunday Ron Dayne Tiki Barber NYG vs Redskins To me Barber is looking muc h more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I dont see New York taking a lead where they can grind out the clock If youre a Dayne own er youre painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in favor of Barber when his team trails The Giants are a good team but I d on t see them jumping all over Washington Plus the Redskins play very good rush defense For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to t he opposing RB and over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game James Stewart Det vs Viking Defense Stewarts great game against Ta mpa Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but hes go t a surprisingly tough situation here Minnesota over the last four weeks ran ks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Part of that has to do with the Vikings explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up but part of it is that the Vikings are just improved there LB Dwayne Rud d should miss the game with a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but Im still not overly excited about the matchup Still though Stewart is one of the better backs and Id think hes likely a starter for your team unless youre loaded with RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Darnell Autry Stanley Pritchett Phi vs Titan Defense The Eagle RBs have been very little factor and I dont see them all of a sudden emerg ing against a very tough Tennessee defense Especially one in a foul mood afte r another last second loss from the kicker Its a tough job but QB Don ovan McNabb carries this team almost solely on his shoulders He could be the teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs For th e year the Titans rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Mike Anderson Den vs Saints Defense I like Mike Anderson and hes a great story but hes got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans The Saints rank for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last four games they rank in rushing yards allowed pe r game Theyve just averaged yards per game allowed rushing Anders on is still probably worth a start unless youre really deep at RB but just b e aware hes facing a tough defense Charlie Garner SF vs Charger Defense With a week off to prepare Garne r comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first victory Theyre playing rush defense like were accustomed to seei ng from San Diego ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Garner isnt your normal back but hes facing a tough game h ere I d still start him as hes got that big play potential with the ability to go the distance at any time but Im not excited about the matchup Jerome Bettis Pit vs Raider Defense Jerome Bettis was built for grinding down defenses in the December cold but hell have a tough match up this week against Oakland The Raiders rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Thats partly why their passing defe nse is so bad teams cant run so they go to the air I like Bettis and I t hink hell be able to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a difficult matchup here Jerald Moore Chad Morton NO vs Bronco Defense Assuming Moore is ok with his neck stinger hell be running behind his outstanding OL but t his is a tough matchup against the Denver Defense thats remained tough vs the run Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing an average of yards per game Ricky Watters and Seattle only managed to post against them Sunday Moore looks to get the majority of carries and goalline work so hes the better option at this point assuming he can go But even healthy hes got his work cut out for him To unsubscribe from this group

Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to reports out of Foxboro New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe took his regular turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid ay and all indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as usual against the Chiefs Monday night Of course that hardly means Bledsoe is percent healthy hes anything but And whether its jammed bruised sprained fractured broken or just plain old sore the real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th e thumb on his throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability to throw the ball Not surprisingly head coach Bill Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off than hes been the previous three weeks This is the th week of the season There will be a lot of players out there on both teams who will be less than percent and Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac is one of them said Belichick Same thing wit h our quarterback Thats football in the th week of the season Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in Detroit on Thanksgiving day but regressed as the game progressed throwing two crucial fourthquarter interceptions that kept the team from mounting a realistic comeback And even though Bledsoe continues to insist the thumb isnt affecting his throws youd be hardpressed to find any evidence backing that contention The bottom line here says a lack quality depth at the key offensive skill positions around him make it very difficult to rely on Bledsoe for consistent production Other items of interest Michael Felger of the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with the weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at lessthanfull speed coaches would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs The question is whethe r injuryprone JR Redmond will be up to the task If not look for Belichi ck to spread the load between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass Reserve tight end Chris Eitzmann ribs was placed on injured reserve for the season leaving the Pats with one roster spot to fill Starting wid e out Troy Brown leg was the only player not to fully participate at practice and his availability is likely to be determined by a dreaded game day decision MITCHELL REMAINS ON TRACK TO RETURN AS BENGALS STARTER IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals head coach Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as probable to star t at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals tomorrow Mitchell missed last weeks game against Pittsburgh because of a sprained left knee This week his mobility was better as he took percent of the practice snaps and Akili Smith took percent I think probables a good word LeBeau said Were gonna see h ow Scotts knee responds but he looks better every day Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Fridays practice I dont see any reason why I shouldnt be able to go he said LeBeau said Mitchell probably wont need a Sunday morning test as he did last week before the Pittsburgh game I dont think that will be necessary unless some complications develo p between todays workout and Sunday LeBeau said According to those who follow the team closely the Bengals would like to use the teams remaining games to evaluate Mitchell before attempting to resign to the veteran signal caller to compete with thirdyear mantobe Smith for the starting QB job next season Team president Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his first practice in days Thursday Other items of interest Browns continuous and vehement denials havent stopped the speculation regarding his future role with the team SportsLinecom jumped on the bandwagon this week when the reported that the man I like to call the Neanderthal GM is thinking seriously about reducing his own role and bringing in a football man along the lines of former Steeler director o f football operations and current ESPN NFL maven Tom Donahoe to handle the daytoday front office duties Browns response to another report stating that a handful of close friend had advised him to step down and let somebody else handle the teams football operations was classic I dont have five friends he stated flatly And finally Rookie wide out Peter Warrick said his skipping a teammandated eye appointment last Tuesday was an oversight But if he ski ps another one it will cost him Team officials set up the checkup because they believe Warrick needs conta ct lenses Receivers coach Steve Mooshagian felt strongly enough about it to levy a fine if Warrick goes AWOL again GROH UPBEAT AS MARTIN CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ESPNs John Clayton reported last night that New York Jets halfback Curtis Martin took all of his regular snaps Friday and should be fine for Sunday s game against the Colts Martin still has a bruised gluteus maximus but hes in better shape than last week The fact that he opened the week listed a probable rather than starting out as questionable like last week has to be a good sign And if you asked me head coach Al Groh seemed to be quite a bit more upbe at this week at one point responding to a reporters request that he assess Martins current condition by saying Fine fine Thats about as indepth detailed and upbeat reply Ive heard him utter this season But seriously folks The soreness in Martins booty could linger but it wont keep the former Patriot out of the lineup And with Bernie Parmale e emerging as a legitimate threat in a relief role the Jets seem to be capable of getting the job done Also of interest this morning Rookie tight end Anthony Becht now has a neck injury to go along with the sore knee thats bothered him the last two weeks However the youngtster is expected to start and play as usual at this point Fellow rookie Laveranues Coles will miss his second straight game with a knee sprain and his absence has clearly left a void in the teams vertical passing game th e last two weeks On a more postive note Coles was able to get some light work in during practice late this week and could return at or near full speed sometime next week In the meantime Windrell Hayes will continue to come off the bench as the numberthree man until Coles return Former Steeler wide out Malcolm Johnson is becoming part of the Jets syste m as expected Groh said The newcomers biggest challenge is simply learnin g how the Jets operate Hes getting more comfortable with the plays and the words Groh said Every team has a different language and you have to adjust to that He seems to be a quick student he just needs to get through all the lessons And finally While the Jets obviouly have some kind of plan in mind for implementing Leon Johnson its too early to tell when he might be able to follow through on such a plan We saw some of the skills that made him a good player in the past Groh said of Johnsons first workout with the team on Wednesday But you also saw that he started training camp Wednesday After blowing out his left knee in the Jets season opener last year Johnson is eager to work his way back into the mix Some guys take two days to get ready in training camp Groh said Some guys take days or two weeks Thats where we are with Leon Im feeling good Johnson said Its just real good to be back out ther e Thats really all Im concerned with right now The Jets would love for him to return to form quickly so he can resume kickreturn duties soon and relieve Dedric Ward who has not been impressive BIAKABUTUKA OUT HOOVER TO START VS RAMS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Friday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to reports out of Carolina tonight the Panthers will hit the field this Sunday without Tim Biakabutuka who is struggling to overcome a painful turf toe injury for the third week in a row According to ESPN NFL insider John Clayton the Panthers deactivated the former firstround draft pick because they didnt want to ruin his chances of playing the fin al three weeks of the season Brad Hoover an undrafted rookie from Western Carolina will continue to line up as the starting halfback His yard oneTD performance in Monday nights win over the Packers added exponentially to the sudden celebrity status Hoover attained after h is first game as the starter This whole thing has just been crazy he said Ive never gotten this much attention before and Im still trying to figure out how to handle it Count St Louis signal caller Kurt Warner among Hoovers fans I always like that stuff its always good to see guys that were never given much of a chance to come in and really make a name and do well for themselves the former Arena League star noted Heck Biakabutuka even admitted to mixed emotions as he stood on the sidelines watching fans respond to Hoover in a way theyve never responded to him However the former University of Michigan star also realizes just how hard Hoover has worked in almost total obscurity prior to gettin g this break all of which made it hard not to be happy for his teammate But Biakabutuka also found himself just a little bit worried after teammat e Michael Bates told him the story of fella named Wally Pipp who played first base for the New York Yankees Or at least he did until the day this new kid named Lou Gehrig came along and filled in for him I dont want to be Wally Pipp Biakabutuka said earnestly Other items of interest Wide receiver Donald Hayes who missed Monday nights game with a groin injury is expected to return to the starting lineup this week Veteran fullback William Floyd will also spend another week on the inactiv e list

Players As we head down the home stretch identifying those players movi ng up or down can be the difference betweendominating the playoffs or watchi ng from the sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these player s its inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or downg rade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players th at are moving In other words a player like TE Ricky Dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Like wise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he s still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Aaron Brooks NO We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up yards and TDs as h e went for The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it appea rs Brooks will continue to air the ball out Yes hell make some young QB mistakes and Id be surprised if he didnt throw as many interceptions as he does TDs I expect him to throw a lot of both I almost started him over Peyton Manning in my local league but didnt pull the trigger Manning wa s solid but Brooks was better QB Kordell Stewart Pit Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here he sits again It took a few years but hes showing folks that maybe was no fluke He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked out with a bad knee or calf depending on whether you listen to coach Bill Cowher or Stewart The TD rush was highlight material His problem all along seems to have been confidence and hes surely brimming with it now Kent Graham was so bad I wont even mention him in the downgrades but he p ut on a horrid display when he was in the game Hes awful QB Jay Fiedler Mia Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks ago that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler was as pretty as anything Dan Marino ever threw Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair ly often against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going to have an advantage in their cold weather Didnt play out that way Fiedler looks pretty darn good QB Jeff Garcia SF We had him high in week like we have all year and he didnt disappoint WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently Jerry Rices wifeharping on the radio had some sort of positive effect The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded them QB Brett Favre GB I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu y just does what it takes to get the job done Hed be much better off if W R Antonio Freeman earned of his paycheck but in the meantime Bill Schroeders doing a great job QB Jeff George Was Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to keeping his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday George looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year Although tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch Im a Jeff George fan though and he does give the team a big arm Well see how it goes but at least it looks as if hell get his shot RBs Moving Up RB Mike Anderson Den Like you need me to tell you this The fact that he ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the more impressive He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to be good for Sunday Clearly the Denver OL is the star on this team so if you own Anderson its probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t he stretch run RB Fred Taylor Jac For all the earlyripping Ive done to Taylor hes performed just as we predicted he would lately like a madman You dont need me to tell you hes been awesome RB Warrick Dunn TB Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike Alstott Ive got a couple hundred reasons that says yes Ok rushing for against Dallas is nothing special its happened in of the Cowboys games this year but you have to admit Dunn looked great Sunday RB Corey Dillon Cin One can only salivate about what he might do if he played for a team like Denver The fact he can continue to roll up huge yardage on this team is amazing New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as he looks like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili Smith RB Ahman Green GB Greens a guy thats finally living up to his potential You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to be catching up mentally as well He showed a nice nose for the endzone Sunday with the TDs RB Lamar Smith Mia So much for the cold weather hamstring worries Smith carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great It look s to me like hes picking up right where he left off RB Terrell Fletcher SD Its not exactly the same as earning the startin g RB job in Tennessee or Indianapolis but Fletcher does seem to have nailed down the RB slot in San Diego And thats worth something You have t o decide how much RB Fred Beasley SF We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up TDs He got back in the mix Sunday with carries and a TD The FB for S an Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth th e roll of the dice if youre thin at RB RB Shawn Bryson Buf Finally Bryson does something besides make me look bad for hyping him He rolled up yards on just attempts Sunday and looks to take advantage of Sammy Morris ankle troubles RB Terry Allen NO Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore and Chad Morton failing to astound anyone Allen could get more looks Whether hes got anything left in the tank remains to be seen WRs Moving Up WR David Boston Ari Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be considered an upgrade Hes a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total non factor Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummers attention these days And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind he could do some damage WR Darrell Jackson Sea Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had cooled of late He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center Its tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort h a shot WR Curtis Conway SD Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf resurgence He caught passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues to improve WR Willie Jackson NO Jacksons officially moved past the flash in the pan stage with another solid day Aaron Brooks continues to look good at QB Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no w hes looking good WR Joe Horn NO Again QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime recipient Joe Horn is one of the better stories of and he should continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesnt get untracked WR Bobby Shaw Pit Shaw may still be available in your league as the starting WR opposite Hines Ward He found the endzone again and continues to make some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking WR Terrell Owens SF The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a solid day from Terrell Owens Hes a huge boost to the offense when he ca n go and it looked like hed made progress with the toe Keep an eye out fo r how he responds after the game but I liked what I saw WR Shockmain Davis NE Ok Ill be honest Im pretty much just includi ng him here because hes the owner of the coolest name in the league TEs Moving Up TE Dwayne Carswell Den Carswells finally starting to emerge as the TE of choice in Denver His yards Sunday were second only to San Diegos Freddie Jones You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I d have no trouble starting Carswell each week TE Reggie Kelly Atl One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th e play of Kelly He caught passes for yards Sunday with a TD New QB Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in TE Mark Bruener Pit Bruener makes the list not only for having another solid game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a s he piggy backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t he yard line TE Andrew Glover NO Obviously the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve l of play for all the Saints receivers Glover made a couple of nice plays Sunday including a good looking TD catch Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Shane Matthews Chi Take a seat Shane Cade McNown likely makes his return Folks can hardly wait QB Troy Aikman Dal Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem strange to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro m a huge deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt Clearly the team has zero faith in Aikmans ability to throw the ball QB Shaun King TB I know hes had trouble with the back but passing yards Thats a joke Hell be better but Ive seen enough QB Brad Johnson Was Its the Jeff George show At least untilGeorge looks bad for a few series QB Rob Johnson Buf In leagues that penalize for interceptions youd ha ve been better off starting yourself this weekend than you wouldve Rob Johnson Once again he starts the game but finishes holding a clipboard RBsMoving Down RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons not playing too badly but the team is in shambles After QB Chris Chandler was benched Anderson vented some frustrations saying for all he knew he might be punting this week I dont think well see that but I also dont think well see the days of him seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year RB Shaun Alexander Sea RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an ideal playmate refusing to share the ball Actually hes played so well that Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o f his star When the team is struggling as badly as it is you dont mess with the one thing thats working Philadelphia RBs Forget about them This team will live and die by Donovan McNabb RB Jermaine Fazande SD Evidently Fazande is the nd choice behind Terrell Fletcher now Thats gotta hurt WRs Moving Down WR Joe Jurevicius NYG This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu s as hes been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto r when he returns Hes no lock to go this week but he may be close WR Terrance Mathis Atl Mathis continues to struggle on a team thats in a tailspin New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso n which could spell more bad things for Mathis WRs Torrance Small Charles Johnson Phi Forget about it Donovan McNa bb can be a solid QB without WRs WRs James McKnight Wayne McGarity Dal These guys just arent very McGood QB Troy Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self WR Marcus Robinson Chi Robinsons back troubles were apparently more serious than many had expected It was announced Monday that hell likely miss the rest of the season with a bulging disk in his back It appears h e can get by without surgery but hes certainly not looking good TEs Moving Down TEs Marcus Pollard Ken Dilger Ind Neither of these guys did much Sunday This offense clearly isnt in the same groove it was earlier this year TEs Jackie Harris David LaFleur Dal More bad news associated with Tro y Aikman Neither of these guys were much value Sunday and I dont see that changing very quickly TE Pete Mitchell NYG One of the bigger disappointments at TE this seaso n he just cant get untracked To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

see the matchups this week Please note see the cheatsheet onlineweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank playersand to determine who to start Just becau se one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is mea nt to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software fo r more info Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Seattle Passing Game vs Bronco Defense If weve seen one trend rece ntly in defenses its to start your QB WR TEs against the Broncos and wo rry about your RBs Theyre tough on the running game but easy against the pass I wont get into whether thats a chicken or the egg situation but the bottom line is go with your passing guys against Denver They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks QB Jon Kitna gets another start and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in him hes been ok Derrick Mayesand Sean Dawkinsshould see lots of action and rookie Darrell Jacksonis working his way back into the mix I f youve been sitting on RB Shaun Alexander coach Mike Holmgren did sa y he wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but Im still not too excited about him yet Tennessee Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Once again keep an eye on QB Steve McNairshealth this week Its early but hes already b eing called a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle injuries Keep your fingers crossed as its a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pa ss defense They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last month and are just playing out the season Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost for the year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier Derrick Masonis the clear cut WR with Chris Sanders The best receiver on the team or at least most utilized is TE Frank Wycheckwho s starting to get back to his normal high level of production Denver Passing Game vs Seahawk Defense By now you know the drill Sta rt any player vs Seattle Just do it The Seahawks are anemic QB Brian Griese did start to throw some but hes still at least a couple weeks a way maybe more Gus Frerottegets another start and if youre looking for him to regain that yard form he showed early on this is his best chance to do it Rod Smithand Ed McCaffreyare the usual must starts at WR Dway ne Carswelland Desmond Clarkare excellent plays at TE Id start eithe r one and feel pretty good about it especially Carswell Baltimore Passing Game vs Charger Defense San Diego made a run back at respectability on defense but Im thinking theyve fallen back down t o well below average Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be ready to roll QB Trent Dilferis playing exceptionally well and WRs Qadry Ismailand Patrick Johnsoncould do well The most enticing matchu p may be Shannon Sharpeas San Diego ranks just th in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year St Louis Passing Game vs Viking Defense I dont think you keep QB K urt Warnerdown for long Sure he had an awful game last week but some of th at can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you dont see drop half of what Warn er throws this time The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last month For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Isaac Bruce is the best WR while Torry Holthas been surprisingly disappointing lately Hes still worth a start though AzZahir Hakimalways has a chance too The Vikings just dont have the secondary to keep up with these guys Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Colt Defense I probably get more mail from my ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player I make no apologies as I really just dont like the guy He simply has major troubles finishin g a game Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy one of th e weaker defenses in the league Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is questionable so they might be even less effective On the other hand th e Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home As you can see from my rankings Im not thinking too much of Johnson again this week but he does have a good matchup Eric Moulds is the primary WR as always with Peerle ss Price and Jeremy McDonald picking up the scraps TE Jay Reimersma is a favorite target and gets plenty of looks Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Giants Defense The Kordell Stewart Bandwagon is getting awfully crowded lately but for good reason Hes playing ve ry solid football More importantly he cleared a huge hurdle Sunday showing some leadership and toughness coming back in the game after injuring his leg The Giants defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim Fassells media games where he says ok more than Joe Pesci in L ethal Weapon are apparently working as his playoff guarantee seems to have inspired the team The pass defense still ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last month though For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Hines Ward is the WR of choice on this team and Id feel fine starting him Hes not even th e true guy but you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw For some reason I like him over starter Courtney Hawkins Even TE Mark Bruener is a solid choice as hes done more in the last two weeks than hes done in two years Kansas City Passing Game vs Panthers Defense Im dreading the Gunther Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like Iron Mike A soli d game here could help him keep his job which may have Chief fans pulling f or Carolina From a FF perspective I like Elvis Grbac here He showed Monday night he was clearly back from the finger troubles As usual the running game is a mess but thats good news for Elvis owners as hes forced to go with whats been working for them throwing the ball TE To ny Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and he s certainly the best receiver on the team Derrick Alexander is a sure starter too Sylvester Morris continues to regress which is troubling Carolina ranks just in passing yards allowed per game over the last four games although for the year theyve fared better ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Part of that is they seem to give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be leery in TD only leagues Carolina Passing Game vs Chief Defense If youve been fence sitting w ith Steve Beuerlein this may be a week to take a close look at him The Chief s rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and they may be missing CB James Hasty whos questionable with a knee WR Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and hes a sure starter Donald Hayes got through last weeks game without reinjuring his groin and hes a solid option as well TE Kris Mangum is no Wesley Wa lls but hes a pretty good player The Chiefs do get back home where they re tougher but I like this matchup San Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense The er pass defense is better than people think and the Saints defense is worse than many assume Over the last four games New Orleans ranks in passing yards allowed per game the ers rank In reality both defenses are pretty suspect And both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball Jeff Garcia picked up right where he left off last week against a tough San Die go defense It was great news for Terrell Owens fans as he looks on his way back In the meantime Jerry Rice showed he still has a few tricks in the bag I wouldnt be surprised to see Tai Streets and JJ Stokes see increased time at Rices expense though as many feel the Hall of Famer isnt in the ers plans for RB Charlie Garner is always a threat cat ching the ball TE Greg Clark is suddenly a producer so hes worth a shot to o This could be a shootout Jacksonville Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Two teams heading for the couch in the post season but thats about all they have in common Jacksonville just ran out of time as theyre playing well now Arizona is heading downhill from an already low position Arizona ranks over t he last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game QB Mark Brunell had a n injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be fine He could be a decent play along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell Arizona CB Aneaes Williams is a player but he cant do it all The biggest probl em for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a yard gain each time Minnesota Passing Game vs Ram Defense You dont need any analysis fro m me to know youd better start Daunte Culpepper Cris Carter and Randy Moss The Rams are much improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Still though the Minnesota Big Big counting RB Robert Smith are no br ainers New Orleans Passing Game vs er Defense QB Aaron Brooks continues to b e one of the better stories of this season Hes facing a er time that ll be chock full of youngsters although theyre playing better of late rankin g in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks But that was before losing Safety Lance Shulters to a torn ACL last week Brooks will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should continue to shine Willie Jackson is a solid WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive lately Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Detroit Passing Game vs Packer Defense Of course all this hinges on the ribs of one Charlie Batch If he cant go all bets are off In fact even if he can go you should hedge your bets a bit as weve already se en one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch Its not a bad matchup though against a Green Bay defense thats ranked in passin g yards allowed per game Johnnie Morton is likely the top choice at WR wi th Herman Moore in the mix too Germane Crowell may be able to make his return this week as hes been practicing this week I wouldnt start him yet but keep an eye out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him up I can see plenty of James Stewart in this one though as the weather could be really nasty for this one Chicago Passing Game vs Patriot Defense This ones full of story line s as a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane Matthews The juicy rumor here is that according to a story in the Sun Times McNown would receive a million escalator clause if he plays i n of the offensive snaps this year and next Hes currently at Conspiracies aside Matthews will be without WR Marcus Robinson whos o ut for the year with a bulging disk in his back New England ranks ove r the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game but the turmoil coul d take its toll on the Bears The Bears will also be without Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job Some think that will be a positive I honestly have a hard time getting too excited about Eddie Kennison and Marty Booker Dallas Passing Game vs Redskin Defense Im really interested to see ho w the team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie Ill be surprised if t hey dont kick things up several notches Although I do find it odd that th e guy in charge of the worst performing part of the team passing game is t he guy they decided to elevate to head coach Who knows QB Troy Aikman will try to get through another game without being maimed Hell have J ames McKnight and Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promisin g against a pretty tough defense Dallas showed last week the complete lac k of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding Emmitt Smith the ball as they trailed Tampa by a mile David LaFluer and Jackie Harris both are dropping along with Aikman Philadelphia Passing Game vs Brown Defense Two teams used to bringing up the rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping QB Donovan McNabb finds himself in a strange spot here The Browns are so pitiful against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them at the expense of throwing it But with McNabb the teams best rusher he ll have to decide which way hes going to beat the Browns Charles Johnson an d Torrance Small arent much TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he could make some noise Im interested to see how quickly they work in newly signed RB Chris Warren Miami Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Another good case of misconceptions Miami is better throwing the ball than people give them credit for and the Bucs arent as dominant stopping the pass like many think Over the last four weeks Tampa ranks in passing yards allowe d per game Very solid for sure but not dominating Jay Fiedler continu es to astound his critics as he threw for TDs Sunday I dont think you ll see the same production here but hes still a decent play Leslie Shep herd had been my favorite WR here but with his surgery it looks like Tony Mart in will finally get a start Oronde Gadsden continues to make sick catches Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Cleveland Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This is where Doug Pedersons at He gets the start this week because rookie Spergon Wynn cant go due to injury WR Kevin Johnson is running the scout team in practice Agai nst the tough Eagles secondary he likely will have trouble no matter where he lines up I dont look for much here from any of these guys Cincinnati Passing Game vs Titan Defense The Bengals just wont die quietly Corey Dillon keeps running the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott Mitchellseems intent on proving to folks he really can play at this level He may be able to but he draws a tough matchup Sunday in a Titan team that s solid They rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed pe r game Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad wrist and will likely have to play with a brace WR Peter Warrickwill reportedly have his contact lenses Thursday and that could make a difference Hes often worth a roll of the dice for the start as he ha s the big play potential New York Giant Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The Steelers seemed to enjoy the spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot this week against the Giants Pittsburghs playing tough pass defense now as they rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four games Kerry Collinsis steady but not exciting Hell be throwing t o WRs Amani Toomerand Joe Jureviciusas it looks like Ike Hilliard may not be fully ready yet this week Keep an eye on that one though TE Pete Mitchellhasnt been nearly the factor wed thought hed be Oakland Passing Game vs Jets Defense The Raiders look to bounce back th is week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and distance The Jets are playing tough defense of late ranking in passi ng yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Still though QB Rich Gannonis a pretty much sure starter unless youre loaded at QB Same thing with WR Tim Brown You might roll the dice on Andre Risonor James Jettbut Brown is the man TE Ricky Dudley is likely worth a start just on potential but hes incredibly frustrating like I needed to tell the D udley owners THAT Green Bay Passing Game vs Lion Defense Not only must the Lions defense hit the field without star CB Bryant Westbrook they also have to face Bre tt Favrein the cold weather where hes invincible Check the weather conditions for this one as it could be more than just cold Hes good when its freezing outside but trying to throw the ball in a driving snowsto rm is an entirely different matter Favre will be throwing to WR Bill Schroede r who I think is the better WR choice over mega bucks Antonio Freeman TE Bubba Franksis always worth a look RB Ahman Greenis a nice surprise a nd hes catching the ball well New York Jets Passing Game vs Raider Defense Two teams thatll see what theyre made of square off in a Sunday Night matchup The Raiders are t ough against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the la st four weeks QB Vinny Testeverdeseems to have finally gotten himself untracked WR Wayne Chrebetmay be handled by Charles Woodson but that leaves Dedric Wardand Windrell Hayesfor WRs Theyll be fine FB Ri chie Andersonquietly racks up receiving totals and he could have a good day aga in this week TE Anthony Becht continues to play well and is really coming along New England Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Star QBs on the bench Coaches leaving Whats a player to think If youre a defensiv e player for the Bears youre thinking youd better go out and prove some pe ople wrong that think youre finished Chicago plays tough pass defense rank ing in passing yards allowed per game over the last four week QB Drew Bledsoe will look for WR Terry Glennand the suddenly red hot Troy Brown TEs Rod Rutledgeand Jermaine Wigginshold down the TE spot I hope Shockmain Davis gets a TD as I love to write his name Indianapolis Passing Game vs Bills Defense QB Peyton Manningis still a starter in most leagues but you should know hes facing a tough matchup this week He struggled a bit last time these teams met with a season low yards passing although he did have TDs Marvin Harrisonis of course the clear cut Guy It looks like Terrence Wilkinsis finally breaki ng out of his slump and could be a contributor again Both TEs Ken Dilgerand Marcus Pollardhavent played up to their potential of late Even wit h the bad game last week against Miami the Bills still rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed per game Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Miami Defense Dont start your passing ga me guys against the Dolphins CBs Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain just shut people down Especially a QB like Shaun King whos not healthy in addition to being just an adequate QB Keyshawn Johnson is almost always worth a start just for the showmanship but Im not excited about Tampa throwing the ball here Washington Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Brad Johnsonsprobably tak en his last snap as a Redskin especially after he suggested hed done so That means big armed Jeff Georgetakes the helm Hell likely face a Cow boy defense thats tough against the pass for one simple reason theyre awful defending the run and teams just choose to run all over them Look for Stephen Davis to wear it out When George does throw I think James Thrashis the best option Albert Connellwill likely start but Thrash makes plenty of plays TE Stephen Alexanderis probably worth a shot as is pass catching FB Larry Centers San Diego Passing Game vs Raven Defense Ryan Leafand company get the honor of facing the ranked defense over the past weeks in pas sing yards allowed per game It should be interesting Leaf will be throwing to TE Freddie Jonesand WR Curtis Conway Jeff Graham suffered a mouth injury last week and may need dental surgery Its probably just as wel l as this matchup is looking very sketchy for Leaf Arizona Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense This could get ugly all around Jacksonville ranks over the last four weeks in passing yards allowed p er game And Arizonas Jake Plummeris nursing bad ribs We saw with Cha rlie Batch last week that its hard for a team to keep a QB in the game if h es got injured ribs David Bostonis playing well lately and Frank Sanders h as been awful Im not excited about any of them for this week To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Stephen Davis Was vs Cowboy Defense New Coach Terry Robiskies be en saying hell run Davis into the ground Against a run defense as soft a s the Cowboys no telling how many yards hell gain The arm seems o k and I look for a huge game here RBs roll up yards on Dallas like its an average day Darnell Autry Chris Warren Phi vs Brown Defense It remains to be se en what effect if any newly signed Chris Warren will have this week It wouldnt surprise me a bit if Andy Reid isnt able to come up with a t least a small package of plays that feature Warren Hes a thousand times b etter than Darnell Autry If he cant go this week Id look for him to b e a factor next week for sure The Browns defense ranks in rushing yard s allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is enticing Fred Taylor Jac vs Cardinal Defense Every once in a while those t oo good to be true matchups dont pan out This is certainly one of t hose too good to be true situations but Id be shocked if Taylor doe snt just roll over the Cards They cant stop the run even when they know what s coming at them Arizona ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last month That number wont go down any after this week Mike Anderson Den vs Seahawk Defense Starting any player facing the Seahawks is not a bad rule of thumb Theyve been pretty bad and this week they dont stand a chance against the dominating OL of Denver Anders on practiced fully Thursday so he looks good to go Keep an eye on the weathe r as theyre expecting snow in Denver but Im not too worried about ho w itll effect Anderson Ron Dayne NYG vs Steeler Defense This was the type of game they draft ed Dayne for A ground war vs Pittsburgh in December Its not likely t he Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode whic h means pretty much no Dayne This is shaping up to be a classic battle wit h Bettis on one side and Warren on the other Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Sammy Morris Shawn Bryson Buf vs Colts Defense Keep an eye on who c an go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will likely have some good rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana There were some semi encouraging signs that Morris might be back The Colts rank just over the last weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre soft on the run and someone could make a big splash on Monday Night Charlie Garner SF vs Saints Defense Just as they are with their pass defense the Saints rush defense is overrated Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game And Garner is liable to explode at any time Hes too good in both the rushing and passing gam e to consider sitting down unless youre just loaded Warrick Dunn TB vs Miami Defense It was surprising to me to see the Dolphins slide this far on rush defense Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Doesnt seem right but t hats what the numbers say Either way Dunns a must start given what he s done lately Robert Smith Min vs Ram Defense Like the passing defense the Rams ru sh defense has improved over the year It doesnt matter though You ve got to start Robert Smith End of story He may be the best RB in the leagu e if truth be told Emmitt Smith Dal vs Redskin Defense I think I may be the only one who sees it this way but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real statement for Smith Sure he still may not get the rd down carries as they get a look at Michael Wiley but Emmitt is pretty much working without a net here He proved his mettle once again last week hammering against a tough Tampa team The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in their passing game as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when trailing badly Washington ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so theyre very beatable Tony Richardson KC vs Panther Defense Another week another RB shakeu p in KC as this time its Kimble Anders whos out of the mix I hones tly have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it looks like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now The Panthe rs can be run on Keep an eye on the weather in this one as the passing game could be limited James Allen Chi vs Patriot Defense What a mess Chicago finds itself in The messiah QB is now healthy but still on the bench while the gu ru offensive coordinator has left been run out of town for Utah and both starting WRs are gone for the year with injuries James Allen may be the bright spot as hes run hard and effectively The New England defense c an be vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on Allen to carry a heavy load Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Edgerrin James Ind vs Bills Defense Edgerrin may be having one of th e best poor seasons in NFL history Hes posting great numbers ov erall but youll have a hard time finding a James owner whos real happy with h im If hes your guy you have very little choice but to start him in the Mond ay Night game The Colts are tougher at home and hopefully they wont fin d themselves playing catchup again Although with his receiving ability he s still active in that situation but its not the ideal scenario for any R B when his team is playing from behind The Bills rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so its a pretty average rushing defense Tyrone Wheatley Oak vs Jets Defense Ill keep an eye on this one fo r you but Im hearing while the ankles may be better a broken finger may be giving him trouble Some are speculating this is the cause of his fumbl es last week The Jets play pretty solid rush defense so its truly a mat chup that could go either way Ill try to see what I can find out on this one Michael Pittman Ari vs Jaguar Defense The Pittman injury watch continues as hes still battling turf toe He sat out of practice Thu rsday and may not know his status until Friday or Saturday If he cant go it looks like Clarence Williams could get the start If youre scrambling for RBs hes likely available in your league Even assuming Pittman can go its not a great matchup as the Jags have picked up the level of their play lately Lamar Smith Mia vs Buccaneer Defense Dont let the Buc defense scar e you Theyre a very good unit but as Emmitt Smith proved last week a determined rusher can fare ok there Lamar Smith surely falls under that determined class If hes your guy Id still go with him Tampa ranks over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre allowing an average of yards per game over that time so its not li ke theyre Baltimore yards per game over their last Curtis Martin NYJ vs Raider Defense Like Tampa the Raiders rush defen se has a bark thats a little worse than their bite Theyre solid but not a defense that sends RBs running for cover They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Martin looked great last week and looks to be guy theyre counting on to carry the offense Eddie George Ten vs Bengal Defense Most people have this image in the ir heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run Not so Over the last four weeks only teams are tougher in allowing rushing yards per game Maybe thats because teams choose to pass the ball where Cincinn ati is weak but the bottom line is teams dont run a tremendous amount on t hem However if QB Steve McNair is limited with a bad ankle and knee you ll see a team that runs the ball as their st nd and rd option pretty much their style with a healthy McNair too George is a must start even though its no slam dunk on the matchup James Stewart Det vs Packer Defense Depending on the weather and Charl ie Batchs ribs Stewart could be asked to carry the load this week Gree n Bay is hurting on Defense with DT Steve Warren the latest injured Packer on defense On the flip side theyre playing pretty stingy rush defense averaging rushing yards allowed per game over their last which ranks them Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Brad Hoover Car vs Chief Defense With Tshimanga Biakabutuka revertin g back to his normal cant stay healthy form hes displayed fo r most of his career Hoover gets another shot this week The Chiefs are tough at home a nd the weather could be a factor possibly in his favor but Hoover will take his power rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares Kansas City ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so th ey re pretty solid Travis Prentice Jamel White Cle vs Eagle Defense Neither of these gu ys is doing a great job and theyll both likely struggle against an Eagle team thats serious about defense If it were me Id look elsewhere if these were my guys Marshall Faulk Stl vs Viking Defense While theyre under appreciate d the Viking rush defense is pretty good Over the last four weeks they ra nk in rushing yards allowed per game Theyll have all they want wi th Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher ones Faulk will f ace Hes still a no brainer to start regardless of the opponent Hes reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being worried about them both Coach Mike Martz has talked about using him on special teams to help turn that unit around JR Redmond Patrick Pass Kevin Faulk NE vs Bears Defense With Redmond still ailing the Patriot RB situation is a mess And Bill Belichi ck certainly isnt shedding much light on anything Unless Redmond shows he can be Id probably shy away from all of them as its too mu ch of a shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick The Bears are playing pretty tough rush defense with rookie sensation Brian Urlacher Ahman Green GB vs Lion Defense One bright spot for the Packers this year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green Coach Mike Holmgren in Seattle could have likely saved a pick on Alexander if Green was still in Seattle Greens always had the physical skills but he lagged behin d in other areas Now he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up significantly and the results are showing on the field Its a tough ma tchup as the Lions rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed pe r game but I think hes up for it Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Ricky Watters Sea vs Bronco Defense Denver evidently didnt take k indly to Corey Dillon hanging a Hall of Fame type day on them several weeks ago as theyve been tough against the run since then Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing just yards pe r game Watters is a solid player and not unlike an Emmitt Smith hes a guy thats made a living performing against the tough teams in tough games So its not like Im terrified of this matchup Just be aware it s a tough one One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has said at some point he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander especially in the passing game How much hed like to see isnt kn own right now Terrell Fletcher SD vs Baltimore Defense Lets not go there Baltimore is allowing an average of yards rushing per game over their last games I dont see Fletcher as the guy who breaks that trend Jerald Moore Chad Morton Terry Allen NO vs er Defense Early this week both Moore and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss Sundays game They appear to be healing ahead of schedule and now it looks like both may play Allen spent time running with the first unit in practice so its really murky right now Id tend to shy away from a ll these guys as I think theyll let QB Aaron Brooks throw the ball like he did last week Besides the ers are deceptively stingy against the rush ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Corey Dillon Cin vs Titan Defense Yes this is a tough matchup But s o was Denver and the jersey Dillon wore in that particular tough matchup is now hanging in Canton Ohio I learned and I hope you did too to go wit h the young man pretty much regardless of the opponent Tennessee is very go od in defending the rush but I see very little way you could bench Dillon unless youre just loaded Jamal Lewis Bal vs Charger Defense Lewis is clearly the class of the rookie crop offensively I hear some say they think his early season elbo w injury was actually a blessing as it let him stay fresh I dont know about that but I do know hes running very hard and effectively He doe s draw a tough matchup this week against a Charger defense thats only allowing rushing yards per game over the last games which earns them a ranking of Still though you pretty much have to ride Lewis if he s your guy Jerome Bettis Pit vs Giant Defense This could be a classic battle between two big backs in Ron Dayne and Jerome Bettis Bettis lives for the se kind of games and hell get to lay it on the line Sunday Hes a l ikely starter in your league but the Giants are tough against the rush Over th e last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game I d still feel good about starting Bettis if he were on my roster but you need to be aware itll likely be tough going To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEAccording to the Associated Press out of sheer habit Terry Robisk ie almost forgot he was in charge during his first practice as interim coach of the Washington Redskins In fact the man really in charge wasnt there at all Dan Snyder was attending league meetings in New York and wasnt sitting in his usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday If he had been there th e owner would have seen Robiskie do a doubletake to keep from following the same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers under fired coach Norv Turner Today the whistle blew and I started going out with my receivers Robisk ie said And I realized I couldnt I had to go out and stand in the middle of the field and do whatever it is Norvs been out there doing And what did Robiskie do in the middle of the field I did what I usually do Robiskie said with a shrug Talking Robiskie made some changes He eliminated the morning walkthrough so players can rest their legs He simplified the offensive scheme He spent more time on special teams in part because new special teams coach Pat Flaherty is also trying to nail down a new routine Robiskie also said hell have the last word once the whistle blows and t he game begins Otherwise he made it clear that Snyder is the boss A lot of people want to separate us from Mr Snyder Robiskie said Mr Snyder owns the football team I know that I promise you theres very few things in the building Im going to say I want to change without calling h im to say I want to change it The subject arose when earlier in the day when disgruntled quarterback Bra d Johnson said Snyder not Robiskie made the decision to start Jeff George the rest of the season I think that decisions made from up top I think its obvious Johnson said I think Jeffs going to be the starter the rest of the way out In case something happens with him then Ill be ready to go Otherwise Im just going to finish strong up here and deal with my situation in the offseason Robiskie said the decision to go with George was a collective one made by the coaches and Snyder Turner had planned to go with George for this week s game against Dallas Turner was fired Monday a day after a loss to th e New York Giants If I wanted to change my desk Im going to call him and say I want to change my desk Robiskie said If I want to change quarterbacks Im goi ng to call him and say What do you think of me changing quarterbacks Its his football team To try to separate it were wasting our time Snyder was not available for comment His spokesman Karl Swanson said Robiskie makes all football decisions just as Norv did He doesnt need to ask anybodys permission Still Robiskies remarks might make it even harder for the Redskins to lu re a highprofile coach for next season One thing is for sure The quarterba ck who led them to their only playoff appearance since does not plan to return Johnsons relationship with Snyder has been frosty since the owner signed George to a huge contract in the spring and refused to negotiate a new one for Johnson While Turner preferred Johnson George was Snyders chosen catch Johnsons contract expires at the end of the season and he restated his intention to become a free agent I still stand by what I want to do Johnson said We tried to work out stuff a long time ago and it didnt work out on both sides And youve go t to move on The only way the Redskins can keep Johnson from becoming a free agent woul d be to designate him as a franchise player but that would require an upfro nt commitment of about million from a team with almost no salary cap room Johnsons career record as a starter is Georges is Johnson said he would not mind working with Turner again I wouldnt have a problem strapping it up with him again at all under different circumstances Johnson said Norvs a tremendous coach Hes going to go one way and Im going to go another way and you never know where that road leads in the end lSAINTS PK BRIEN ON THIN ICE IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEAccording to Ted Lewis of the New Orleans TimesPicayune this should be a happy time for Saints kicker Doug Brien For the first time since he was a rookie with the eventual Super Bowl champion ers in hes on a team that is zeroing in on a playoff berth But as so often happens to those playing the most precarious position on the team theres a little dark cloud on the horizon Unhappy with Briens misses of fieldgoal attempts in three of his last four games the Saints brought in freeagent kickers Michael Husted and Doug Pelfrey for workouts Tuesday although neither was signed First of all we wanted to see whos out there special teams coach Al Everest said And I would hope it makes Doug aware that he has a responsibility to the team and to himself and that security in this business is success Its the first time in Briens six seasons with the Saints that his job appeared anything less than secure But the working out of Husted and Pelfrey doesnt have him looking over his shoulder any more than he has in the past I was plenty motivated before said Brien who was told about the workouts by Everest on Monday So it doesnt increase my motivation And it doesnt affect my concentration either Theres always a long li ne of guys out there whether theyre here working out or in camp If you dont perform to a certain standard thats what happens By Brien standards he is not having a good year The fifth mostaccurate kicker in league history coming into the season percent is of The six misses are Briens most since when he was of in si x games with the ers and of in eight games with the Saints Since th en the most he has missed has been five Brien the numbertwo kicker from beyond yards in league history befor e this season has been allowed to try only two from that distance a nd both were blocked Ive been struggling a little bit said Brien who took extra kicks in practice Wednesday I havent been hitting the ball as well as I normally do Its very frustrating but at the same time the law of averages plays i n Ive been pretty consistent over the last five years here and I wouldnt say Im doing horribly I just expect to do better and the Saints expect me to be better Its not so much how many kicks Brien has missed but when he has missed them At St Louis he was wide right on a yarder with left that would have given the Saints a point lead Instead they had to sweat out two more possessions by the Rams that could have tied the score And last week against Denver he was wide left on a yarder in the firs t quarter that would have given the Saints the early lead Never mind that h e made three more after that That miss had Saints coach Jim Haslett visibly unhappy on the sideline last Sunday and again on Monday It wasnt the hold Haslett said then It wasnt the snap It wasnt protection He just missed it and it would have been nice to have had those three points But Wednesday Haslett took the unusual step of sitting with Brien at his locker for several minutes after practice engaging in what appeared to be lighthearted encouragement I have confidence in Doug Haslett said I cant get inside kickers heads but Doug will fight through this and everything will be fine Everybody goes through this in a point in their career Maybe so but kickers and punters are the only frontline players who can be replaced on a moments notice even this late in the season Right now kicking field goals and extra points is all Doug does since o ur kickoff guy is Toby Gowin Everest said But we havent seen anybody yet we think is better than Doug To be sure the Saints will bring in two more kickers next Tuesday Jeff Hall and Scott Blanton And to Brien who likes to think of each kick being of equal value no matter the distance or the situation it is a time to strive to do better Ive been pressing a little too much and trying to make things happen he said Im not way far off but it doesnt take too much I dont think Ive ever missed a kick at the end of a game thats cost t he team a game and I dont intend to start now Im doing what I can to get this fixed and just keep plugging along Also of interest ESPNs John Clayton reported that Terry Allen will probably get the start at halfback for the Saints because of the neck injury to Jerald Moore and the sore shoulder of Chad Morton Morton may play on his shoulder but Moore who has had three recent neck stingers probably wont However neither man was included on Fridays list of early inactives Ric ky Williams and Jake Reed were the only offensive skill players on that list As stated in USA Today WR Joe Horn had catches for yards against the Niners the last time the two teams met the thirdbest receiving yards game in club history He needs nine receptions to break the Saints singleseason record for catches in one year Eric Martin holds the team record of Last week Horn became only the fifth receiver in club histo ry to gain receiving yards Martin did it three times According to Pro Football Weekly the first person among a throng of wellwishers to meet Saints QB Aaron Brooks when he got off the plane following the Saints huge Week win in St Louis was an absolutely exuberant Jeff Blake While the Saints injured starting QB didnt travel with the team to the Rams game Blake continues to make his presence felt in a very highprofile and positive manner And finally PFW also advised against becoming too excited Hasletts announcement last week that Williams who underwent ankle surgery November is ahead of schedule in his rehab and could return for the teams regularseason finale vs the Rams Williams was expected to have the cast on his ankle removed late last week But Haslett has a tendency to be overly optimistic in his estimations on his players projected returns following injuries this season and it s hardly a lock Williams will be ready to rumble before a possible appearanc e in the playoffs if even then The report went on to say that while Williams has supposedly been diligently working out at team headquarters riding an exercise bike and lifting weights he has kept an extremely low profile making it hard for sources outside the organization to get a good read on his actual progress MCGINNIS NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PLUMMER IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGETim Tyers of the Arizona Republic reported this morning that Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummers injured ribs didnt allow him to practice on Friday and whether he plays on Sunday at Jacksonville will be determined by a dreaded gameday decision according to head coach Dave McGinnis He hasnt been able to practice for two days and thats not a good sign McGinnis said If hes not ready to go theres no reason to play him I m not going to risk him It makes no sense If Plummer cant go numbertwo quarterback Dave Brown who is still experiencing soreness in the left shoulder he injured in his only start t wo weeks ago against the New York Giants will start But McGinnis also guaranteed that if Brown does start numberthree man Chris Greisen will see extensive action Its the first Ive heard of it Greisen I have to be ready either way Dave will start but he still has that shoulder problem Its not really a problem its a nuisance and I know its hurting him a little bit but he can still play quarterback at a high level I just have to be ready Also of interest McGinnis said he will take three running backs with the team to Jacksonville Michael Pittman hyperextended big toe saw limited duty on Friday but will be available Backup Thomas Jones assumed a larger practice role this week but Clarence Williams is going for added insurance Thomas has been fine the last two days He seems to be getting a lot better McGinnis said And finally The Cardinals released tight end Derek Brown on Monday lNINERS OWENS MISSES FRIDAYS PRACTICE IMAGEWritten By TFL

inactives Other items of interest Quarterback Jeff Garcia who is ranked third in the latest results of fan balloting for the Pro Bowl would welcome a ticket to Honolulu for the February game If Im able to be selected to represent this team in the Pro Bowl Id definitely be honored and I think it just shows people Ive turned a long way said Garcia who threw for yards and two touchdowns Sunday ers offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg endorsed Garcias Pro Bowl candidacy Jeff threw the football in that game Sunday against San Diego as well as Ive seen him throw Mornhinweg said He was on time He was accurate His decision making was terrific That may be his best ballgame hes played here to date And finally Placekicker Wade Richey isnt afraid to talk about the hot streak hes been on in the past two games He just isnt sure how to expla in the way hes made all six of his fieldgoal attempts which have ranged between and yards Theyve been short kicks but theyve felt good said Richey who had

Thats something to be prou d of You have to be a little bit lucky to get this far but dont hesitate to pat yourself on the back as skill plays a huge part Judging from the emails tons of you are still in mix Dont forget about our Wall of Champions feature where well showcase league winners Stay tuned for mor e details Its crunch time so lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head down the final weekend for many teams identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference betweendominating your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in the money As we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what wer e talking about is players that are moving In other words a player like T E Ricky Dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough t o be a starter in your league It just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make t he upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs I ts all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Jeff Garcia SF Cheatsheetsnet Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to roll No coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this we ek QB Donovan McNabb Phi Mixed emotions here as Ive been hyping McNabb fo r weeks as the guy carrying the Eagles offense But seeing him on my opponents roster in the FanEx playoffs yesterday was less than heartening throwing for TDs and yards Just be aware the Eagles are off this week and wont return till week QB Jon Kitna Sea Like Mike Holmgren maybe Ive been too critical of Kitna He continues to play well and while it likely wont be in Seattle he looks like a starter for some team in QB Aaron Brooks NO A telling mark of a great QB is how he performs when he comes with less than his A game Brooks looked much less in synch Sunday and clearly struggled at times making a few bad throws and missing open receivers Yet he hung in and still posted outstanding numbers His rushing yards quietly add to the points Hes a player Im starting him with few reservations QB Kerry Collins NYG You have to believe his confidence is sky high H e obviously benefited from the return of Ike Hilliard who looked very good This team is looking very tough and very balanced right now The running game is just good enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so dominant that it hurts the QB QB Mark Brunell Jac Its really weird When the hype finally subsides about this guy he starts delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype Go figure QB Kurt Warner StL This may have been the greatest QB performance in th e history of the league without scoring a TD The guy was incredible completing of his passes of Completing with an average pa ss of yards is sick The TDs will come as Warner looked as good as Ive ever seen him placing the ball perfectly and directing his offense QB Ray Lucas NYJ Keep an eye on Vinnies groin Better yet watch the injury reports for news on Vinnies groin Thats better We should know more soon but if its serious Lucas will get the start RBs Moving Up RB Marshall Faulk StL I know you dont need me to list him here but it s worth noting I think he may be the best player in the league right now Martz fed him the ball times and he delivered RB Eddie George Ten George showed outstanding pass receiving skills and added receiving TDs to go with his rushing TD He reinjured his sore to e but looks to be ok Keep an eye on it though RB Fred Taylor Jac What a shocker Taylor runs wild again as we predicted He did tweak a knee so watch that but if he can go full speed hes a no brainer starter against just about anyone RB James Allen Chi If departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was dead dont get excited Bears fans hes not hed be spinning in his gra ve to see Allen garner carries Sunday Be a little leery though as a ypc carry average only works when you carry the ball a ton RB Travis Prentice Cle After fading badly Prentice comes roaring back with a TD performance He only had yards on attempts but the TDs are huge The Brown offense featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson occasionally at QB but they looked much better RB Mike Anderson Den What else can you say The Denver OL is having another Pro Bowl season Anderson is a must start vs any team right now RB Ahman Green GB Im very nervous if Im Dorsey Levens right now Greens been an offensive stalwart carrying the load week after week Everyone always knew he had the potential to be this good but now hes delivering RB Emmitt Smith Dal As was mentioned on the broadcast yesterday Someo ne forgot to tell the Redskins this game is a rivalry You know the Cowboys and Emmitt in particular had to enjoy humiliating the Redskins It would be a bold move even for him but I wouldnt be surprised in the least to see Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie before his obligatory three games are up RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes me look bad for dissing him this Summer Against the Cardinals this wee k he has the chance to be even better RB Warrick Dunn TB If Dunn had any help the Bucs would scary Right now hes doing it all by himself Which probably isnt a bad thing for Dunn owners RB Tony Richardson KC Richardson netted ypc on carries Donnell Bennett looks to have cartilage damage to his knee so Richardsons workloa d should increase Its a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther Cunningham to give Richardson more looks RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka Car Dont hold your breath but Biakabutuka is making noises about returning to the lineup this week Well see RB Terry Allen NO In a lesser version of Denvers OL it appears most anyone can run effectively behind these guys Allen looked rejuvenated Sunday and should only get better as he gets familiar with the system RB Chris Warren Phi Remember that hes off this week but if your league runs through week he could be a factor WRs Moving Up WR Sean Dawkins Sea Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong numbers As is Jon Kitna Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could continue his roll WR Torrance Small Charles Johnson Phi Look what QB Donovan McNabb can do when his WRs decide to show up If they can continue to play well thi s team could be scary Remember theyre off this week but return in week WR Amani Toomer NYG Of the resurging Giants Toomers leading the charge Hes making plays all over the field and even had a nice run agai n WR Terrell Owens SF The scary part is he could have been even better th an the yard TD performance Sunday He looked very good coming back from the toe injury and should only get better The ers are trying to nail down their WR corps for and Owens is making a statement WR Ed McCaffrey Den Its easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod Smith but the truth of the matter is that theyre both excellent WRs I love McCaffrey and his th grade shoulder pads Hes the antiEric Dickerson when it comes to pads or lack thereof Easy Ed goes with prett y much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder pads and thats it Oh yeah hes al so a great WR WR Darrell Jackson Sea Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and delivered I see few reasons why he wont continue to shine WR Torry Holt StL Its tough to predict which Ram WR will catch the passes from Warner but as I said several weeks ago Holt may be the best W R on the team And thats no sleight to Isaac Bruce Holts that good WR Terry Glenn NE Glenns putting together one of his most complete seasons And Bledsoes continuing to play pretty good football which help s WR Willie Jackson NO catch TD You gotta like a guy who gets rig ht to the point Joe Horn is the clear threat but Jackson is a serious option too WR Germane Crowell Det This didnt look like a guy returning from a broken leg He should continue to get better as he becomes more involved in the flow of things WR Bobby Shaw Pit It seems hard to believe but Bobby Shaw is a legitimate starter in many leagues Hes getting lots of looks and the Steeler are throwing the ball WR Ike Hilliard NYG Hilliard looked well rested as he roared back onto the scene An sprained knee suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa se Hilliards playing time even further WR Donald Hayes Car Hayes looked better as expected and turned in a nic e game catching passes for yards The Panthers need to remain focused but if they can Hayes could contribute TEs Moving Up TE Johnny McWilliams Min McWilliams again was active catching passes for yards I like any receiver on this team TE Andrew Glover NO Glovers starting to become a very integral part of the New Orleans passing game Its hard to imagine this team losing RickyWilliams Jeff Blake and Cam Cleeland TE Kris Mangum Car Hes no Wesley Walls but hes more than adequate TE Greg Clark SF He only had yards but the receptions were a nice bonus QBs Moving Down QB Scott Mitchell Cin The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the guy we remembered This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential QB Jeff George Was Ive gotta say Im really surprised George didnt post some great numbers Albert Connell isnt nearly as good as he thinks he is and that may be part of the problem QB Steve Beuerlein Car Its clear to everyone that was a career year Hes still subject to a great game here and there but hes just too streaky to lean very heavily on QB Shaun King TB This guy just isnt very good QB Charlie Batch Det Ive never been a big Charlie Batch fan although hes certainly had his days He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and possibly losing Herman Moore wont help Although German Crowell is back QB Troy Aikman Dal I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve Young a call A sore back is one thing Not remembering your kids names is an entirely different matter Its not worth it Guy QB Ryan Leaf SD Part of it was Baltimore A large part of it was Leaf QB Jay Fiedler Mia Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non throwing shoulder The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely whether itll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB QB Vinnie Testeverde NYJ Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may not be serious Hes not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this one RBs Moving Down RB Ron Dayne NYG Its just hard to get excited about starting this guy as hes such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan Hes always liable to grab that short yardage TD but you just dont know when or where theyll happen RB Jerald Moore FA Things change quickly in this league A few weeks ago Moore looked to be the RB Now hes unemployed RB Darnell Autry Phi Id expect that Chris Warren will cut into his time when they return RB Jamel White Cle Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched this week RB Brad Hoover Car He came back to reality this week On top of that it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to t ry and return this week WRs Moving Down WR Herman Moore Det Moore suffereda neck stinger Sunday He could likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good returning from his injury WR Tai Streets SF Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action a s the ers tried to see what they had for but with the return of Terrel l Owens it looks like Streets will be limited WR Courtney Hawkins Pit Hes losing time to Bobby Shaw The Steeler W Rs seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw WR Danny Farmer Cin Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot alongside Peter Warrick but it doesnt look like its going to make any difference WR JJ Stokes SF Like Tai Streets Stokes suffers from the return of Terrell Owens WR Sylvester Morris KC Morris continues his regression which should se nd red flags as owners look towards WR Keyshawn Johnson TB With Shaun King struggling I dont see a brigh t future for Keyshawn ahead He sounds like a politician conceding when he speaks of the team finding its identity in running the ball TEs Moving Down TE Anthony Becht NYJ In the up and down season from Anthony Becht it looks like hes headed down a bit The injury to Testeverde affects his stock in a negative way TE Tony McGee Cin Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he suffered a broken ankle TE Jeff Thomason Phi Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the primary TE TE David LaFluer Dal Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

create opportunities for the offensive players across the line from them Once again this week Zach Thomas finds himself on the inactive list Without him the Miami D gave up yards to Ahman Green last Sunday James Stewart scored three times a couple of weeks back against the Bucs tough D without MLB Jamie Duncan so theres no reason not to start him regardless of the matchup In the same game keep an eye on Stephen Boyds status with the Lions Hes missed most of the weeks practices with a bruised foot that was sore enough there was concern it was fractured If he cant go that opens things up for the Fins Lamar Smith Keith Brooking joined Jessie Tuggle on the IR this week meaning that Mike Alstott will have huge holes up the middle of the Falcons defense to rumble through Look for big games from both him and Warrick Dunn Bryce Paup and Orlando Thomas remain out of the Vikings lineup which bumps Brett Favres stock up a few notches Shaun King had a field day last week For the second straight week Jerome Bettis is facing a defensive line without key components Henry Ford is out and Kenny Holmes is nursing a very sore shoulder Holmes will have to tough it out since backup Byron Frisch is inactive The bus should keep rollin on Duane Cahill Pittsburgh TribuneReview FFL Columnist TFL Report News and Notes Bob Harris TFL Report is one of my favorite sources for indepth insights and analysis Lots of sites tell you whats happened Bob tells you what it means Here are a few selections for this weeks report THE GLOVES ARE OFF JOHNSON ACCUSES FLUTIE OF INSTIGATING IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE As reported by Mark Gaughan of the Buffalo News Rob Johnson may be on the sidelines but hes no longer silent about the Buffalo Bills brewing quarterback controversy Johnson took exception to a column in this weeks Sports Illustrated that quoted two unidentified Bills speaking about the teams quarterbacks The story quoted one Bill as saying Rob seems distracted by things like wanting everyone to like him It quoted another as saying Hed rather get pummeled by four guys than throw the ball away in order to help his quarterback rating Johnson who did not make himself available to local media this week went on the Jim Rome nationally syndicated radio show Friday and said he thinks it was one player who made the comments And he thinks that one player was Doug Flutie I think everyone who reads the article will pretty much know who it is Johnson said I think its the same one thats pictured in the article The only Bill pictured in the article is Flutie Johnson said he confronted the player whom he suspected on Friday We talked about it today Johnson said He said he talked about the quarterback rating stuff but he never mentioned my name Basically that was it Asked if he thought Flutie was a good teammate Johnson said Im sure hes a good teammate for the rest of the guys and hes fine with them Obviously hes real competitive Hes reaching the end of his career He probably wants to still play I dont blame him for that But if he was responsible for these comments I would not consider him a good teammate Johnson said he did not see the team being divided over the QB question I dont see it that way he said I dont know though I mean I havent talked to all the players But I dont think many players in our locker room worry about quarterback rating or even worry about what our quarterback ratings are Its absurd to think players worry about that or even quarterbacks worry about that when they are playing in a football game However he said he didnt like unattributed comments from teammates For someone to go anonymously and say those things is kind of I dont know cowardly he said Its not typical of football players If a lot of guys feel that way they should come to me and say it to my face he said Im a man Theyre men and I can take it Id rather hear about it from them than hear about it on the radio when Im driving home from an FM channel when Im trying to listen to Limp Biskit Regarding the desire to be liked by his teammates Johnson said Im years old Most of guys on our team are pretty young and we have a lot in common We hang out I dont go out of my way to make friends or kiss anyones butt Everywhere Ive been on teams Ive had a good relationship with the guys on the team and I have a lot in common with them Asked if he got the sense he was competing against Joe Montana for the QB job Johnson replied I wish it was Joe Montana because at least he won some Super Bowls and won MVPs in the league I wish that was the case I think that would be an easier situation Regarding his injured shoulder Johnson said it is not percent It tightened up on me pretty good today he said I havent been able to get my arm pretty much all the way over the top or raise it all the way above my head to throw the ball Ive kind of been sidearming things just trying to get through practice so I could be the backup I dont know what they are going to do I want to back up but that might not be in the best interest in the team this week Head coach Wade Phillips said Friday he would wait until pregame warmups Sunday to decide whether Johnson would be numbertwo or numberthree against New England Although Phillips wasnt willing to address the escalating tension between Johnson and Flutie Buffalo general manager John Butler speaking on the Empire Sports Network said he doesnt fear the team is in turmoil I was at practice today and it looked like a football team preparing for the New England Patriots he said Ill tell you if youve been around sports been in locker rooms if you get men together not everybody is going to like everybody all the time The key is to be respectful of one another and when it comes time to play you play hard and play together Everybody isnt going to be walking hand in hand down the hallways but weve got a team thats going to stick together and play their hearts out and thats all that matters These are grown men Sometimes its fun to even blow it up a little bit more than it is and so be it Its incumbent upon our team to stick together and they will he said Ive been through this times Butler dismissed the SI quotes because they had no attribution If you want to say something and cant put your name to it it bothers me he

TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to Frank DellApa of the Boston Globe it looks like Kevin Faulk will be asked to carry running game when the New England Patriots take on the Buffalo Bills tomorrow Faulks opportunity comes at the expense of rookie JR Redmond who displaced Faulk in the starting lineup with a carry yard performance against the Colts two weeks ago but was downgraded to questionable on Fridays injury report after hurting his foot in practice Thursday According to head coach Bill Belichick Redmond stepped on something at practice and wasnt able to do much Friday I dont know if Ill be playing more Faulk said Whatever the game plan is Im ready every week Faulk will be facing a difficult test this time Buffalo has surrendered rushing yards the secondlowest total in the NFL All you have to do is check the stats Faulk said Teams dont average more than yards a carry against them The Patriots are averaging yards per rush and Faulk is averaging yards per rush Its always a challenge but this time its even more of a challenge because we are going against one of the best defenses in the league Faulk said We cant expect to run over them no What we need is a balanced attack If we can get that going and move the football we should be all right Faulk was on pace to gain more than yards after four games but he has tailed off with a total of yards in the last four games But Faulk is the teams leading allpurpose yardage player with yards an average of yards each time he has the ball Team officials had hoped the Redmonds ascension to the first team would allow Faulk to concentrate on what most observers feel he is best suited for thirddown duty As productive as he might have been the first half of the season concerns over Faulks durability have been an issue from day one and Belichick is convinced the former LSU standouts ability to run the ball effectively is inversely proportional to the number of time he carries it Other items of interest After working extensively at wide receiver this week tight end Eric Bjornson was included on the teams list of early inactives yesterday And his chances of contributing to the offense in coming weeks dont sound very good after team officials indicated that Rod Rutledge will start at tight end for the remainder of the season Wide receiver Terry Glenn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice but hes listed as probable and coaches expect him to start and play as usual against the Bills tomorrow Quarterback Drew Bledsoe missed Thursdays practice in order to stay with his wife as she gave birth to the couples third child The veteran signal caller will start and play as usual tomorrow REDSKINS JOHNSON HAS SIGNIFICANT MCL TEAR IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Mark Maske of the Washington Post reported this morning that Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson is suffering from a significant tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee that is relatively close to being a complete tear Maske went on to write even when his MCL heals sufficiently for him to resume playing Johnson will face the risk of suffering a more severe knee injury by playing on the damaged joint He will have to decide how much risk to take playing for a team he might leave via free agency in the offseason at a time when his contract is about to expire and he has no guaranteed income beyond this season As he exited Redskins Park yesterday Johnson acknowledged the increased risks but said he plans to play again this season and will make his decisions based solely upon his physical readiness to play not upon future financial considerations He said the timetable for his return is unclear but he refused to rule out the possibility of playing in the St Louis game Team officials expect Johnson to miss that November meeting with the Rams Of course the former Viking has already been ruled out for tomorrows game against Arizona and Jeff George will make his first appearance with Washingtons first team offense this season Maske cited a source close to the situation as saying coaches hope Johnson will return in time for the teams November meeting with Philadelphia at FedEx Field Johnson told Maske yesterday that he has every intention of playing again this season Theres no doubt about that he will play again this season I think its a matter of when The weeks kind of go by fast But were still dealing with seven more games a bye week and the playoffs Right now our team just has to find a way to win and Ive got to find a way to get healthy In time then well get back together Johnson said he would like to be ready to play against the Rams the defending Super Bowl champions The Redskins have days between games because they have a bye the weekend after Sundays Arizona game We probably wont make a decision about the St Louis game until the Wednesday or Thursday before the game Johnson said I would like to play I think that would be a great game to be part of The biggest decision isnt whether its artificial turf or grass Its just being able to drop back and being healthy enough to play a full game However Maskes sources indicate the Redskins are already planning for George to start against St Louis a week from this coming Monday Team officials have described Johnsons injury as a Grade MCL sprain but Maskes sources say the injury is at the severe end of the Grade range and actually borders on being a Grade sprain A Grade injury is defined as one in which the tissue has been partially but not completely torn and there is appreciable limitation in function A Grade injury is one in which tissue has been significantly or completely torn or disrupted and there is a virtually complete loss of function NFL players regularly play with MCL injuries The risk players take by playing on damaged knees is that they will suffer more severe knee injuries Johnson said he knows the risks but will play when he is able The biggest thing is right now the ligament is weak he said Obviously right now It could worsen very easily if I took a hit There hasnt been a whole lot of discussion about that The biggest discussion now is how were going to treat it and get back as soon as possible When Im healthy enough to drop back and play then Ill play that day Johnson says the fact he intends to test the free agent market after the season wont be a factor in determining when he plays again The most important thing for me is to be able to drop back in the pocket Johnson said From that point on if I can drop back in the pocket then Ill play Im not worried about ever taking a hit Ive gone through injuries before The biggest thing to me is being healthy enough to play Im not worried about a contract next year with anyone I feel like my play overall and my history will take care of itself Johnson was on the practice field yesterday with his knee heavily wrapped He moved little made some throws and mostly watched George and rookie quarterback Todd Husak who has been elevated from third to second on the Redskins depth chart at work I feel much better than I did Tuesday or Wednesday Johnson said I can throw normal Theres no problem there I can do a lot of walking I ride the exercise bike about an hour a day The problem is going lateral side to side As a quarterback thats what you do in the pocket So Im not able to drop back at full speed and throw But Im better than I was earlier in the week Other notes of interest out of Washington this morning Veteran fullback Larry Centers comes off a productive game last Monday night catching six passes for yards and a touchdown Given the Redskins injury problems at wide out Centers could get a number of looks out of the backfield this week against his old team the Cardinals Although Albert Connell Irving Fryar and James Thrash are all expected to play the chances of any of them going full speed are slim Look for cornerback Champ Bailey will see his most extensive playing time of the season at wide receiver in order to provide a legitimate deep threat to keep the Cards from focusing their all of their attention RB Stephen Davis Davis had yards on attempts in his two games against the Cardinals in and in what will be a scaledback game plan hes likely to get carries against the Cardinals marshmallowsoft defensive front seven IMAGE BRONCOS KNOW DAVIS IS CRUCIAL TO THEIR SUCCESS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE This is it Its time for Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis to make his second comeback of the season against the Jets tomorrow Unlike the season opener when all eyes were on the veterans surgically reconstructed right knee this time everybody will be watching Davis badly sprained left foot and ankle that get all the attention The former University of Georgia star has missed five of the last seven games including three in a row and has gained only total yards on carries Dont look for coaches to push Davis incredibly hard in his first game back In fact Davis isnt sure how much he might be capable of doing this week Let me just finish this game If I can finish this game Ill be the happiest man on this planet Davis said If I can stay healthy I know good things are going to happen And make no mistake about it Keeping Davis healthy becomes job numberone from here on out Coaches are certainly aware than whatever chances the team might have of making a playoff run lie in having a healthy and productive Davis in the mix So the goal this week will be easing him back into playing shape by giving him maybe carries tomorrow with Mike Anderson taking the rest One factor working in Davis favor Howard Griffiths return to the lineup after experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired left knee the last two weeks The veteran fullback said its all part of the process however and has practiced full speed all week Its getting there Its not going to be percent until Im not banging people anymore he said Bottom line on Davis My expectations are high for him over the remainder of the season but Im not sure Id want to bank on a huge game in his first week back One last note out of Denver this morning Backup running back KaRon Coleman was included on Fridays list of early inactives due to a sprained foot A RELIEVED JEFF GEORGE READY TO FACE CARDINALS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Friday November PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to the Associated Press veteran quarterback Jeff George looked relieved and relaxed after practice Friday It was easier to concentrate on his upcoming first start with the Washington Redskins knowing that his newborn baby was doing fine Thank God George said I think whenever something goes wrong and its your own you worry First things first My familys numberone in my life and I got to take care of them George is starting Sundays game at Arizona because Brad Johnson sprained a knee ligament in Monday nights loss to Tennessee But instead of preparing fulltilt for his first action of the season George missed practice Wednesday when his wife delivered their third child The next day George was distracted by news that the baby Jayden Scott had breathing difficulties It was only just before Thursday afternoons practice that he received word that the baby was fine George who earlier this season answered dad when asked to give one word to describe himself was confident he could overcome the distractions and give a good performance Sunday When you get some sort of news like we did George said you take a back seat and say Whats more important But Ive prepared myself It hasnt been just this week Ive been preparing the last weeks Its not a cram session Ive been preparing from the getgo George signed a fouryear million contract in April to back up Johnson so he could have a shot at playing for a Super Bowl team He said he doesnt see Sundays game as an audition either to replace Johnson or to build interest in other teams considering an offseason trade I think everybody knows what I can do George said Weve got an injury and Ive got to carry the torch You hate to have to play under these circumstances Brads my friend I wish him well I hope he recovers fast Johnson who could miss two to four weeks with the injury is one of many ailing Redskins starters including wide receivers Irving Fryar and Albert Connell who are likely to be less than full speed for Sundays game I probably feel the healthiest out of anybody George said Coaches might have Skip Hicks handle kickoff returns against the Cardinals this Sunday in an attempt to lighten the workload for James Thrash who has been returning kickoffs and punts starting at wide receiver and playing on kickoff and punt coverage teams Great stuff as always from Bob For more

Undergo Knee Surgery nflnewshtml From the article St Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove loose cartilage from his right knee an injury that forced him out of Sunday nights loss to the Carolina Panthers Faulk practiced Friday and went out for pregame warmups after having the knee drained earlier Sunday but the knee began to lock on him Coach Mike Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only weeks But teammate DMarco Farr a defensive tackle was out a month with a similar operation He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there Martz said Really there was nothing else to do Justin Watson started in place of Faulk who leads the NFL with yards from scrimmage Faulk suited up for the first half but was wearing sweats after the break Watson scored on a yard run in the third quarter but finished with yards on carries Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season An MRI on Monday also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the loose cartilage My View Coach Mike Martz called him Superman last week as he battled through injuries Apparently hes mortal after all The surgery to remove the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in weeks If you started Faulk dont be kicking yourself There was nothing you or anyone else could have done As of late Sunday afternoon evening he was still the starter You cant control last minute scratches when a player has a problem during pregame warmups All Faulk owners knew he wasnt but we all know hes still one of the best RBs in the game even when dinged up Hindsight is Let it go All you can do is move forward Lets look at it analytically The problem now becomes a matter of timing If Faulk comes back according to schedule hell be ready in week or Most FF leagues play a game regular season with playoffs in weeks and or if your league hasnt wised up yet This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs For Teams that own Faulk As we predicted Justin Watson carried the load for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with yards on carries although he did get the TD Id think hell improve but its obvious Faulk not just the system is the driving force behind his success What Im saying is that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George stepping in Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate if he ever sheds the candybone label or Robert Holcombe A better option might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well right now like Chicagos James Allen Buffalos Sammy Morris or JR Redmond in New England If youve got a playoff spot secured dont panic Grab a lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs keeping your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery If you need a big push just to make the playoffs Id think very hard about dealing Faulk and shoring up your short term needs You have to remember youve got to MAKE the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl For Teams who dont own Faulk The question you must ask yourself is do you have depth somewhere that youd be willing to trade away for Faulk If you seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs it might be a great move In other words you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be a bench player for you over the next few weeks In turn you get Faulk back just in time for your playoff push But youre banking on Making the playoffs and Faulk being ready by week Only you can judge your chances for but from all Im hearing seems pretty darn likely If youve got the playoffs spot sewn up it could be a great move to trade for Faulk now Dont give up too much Dont hesitate to let the Faulk owner know that teammate DMarco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar injury and we all know a RBs knee takes much more stress with the cutting that does a Defensive Tackles Throw in some comments about St Louis resting Faulk for the playoffs Speaking of the resting for the playoff factor You have to look at how well the Saints are playing The Super Bowl champs are in real danger of not even winning their own division It looks like St Louis will be battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility the Rams resting all their players doesnt seem as likely as it did a month ago Another reason you shouldnt give up too much in trading for Faulk Make sure to sell your position either way based on whether youre a Faulk owner or not If youre trading him away you want to talk up the Saints and the tough scenarios if St Louis loses again the hot Giants are next on the road St Louis will be fighting for their lives youll say If youre dealing for Faulk obviously youll take the other side of the fence and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the postseason The truth in my opinion lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed back into service for the regular season Assuming the surgery rehab goes well of course Faulks one of the tougher guys in the league so I have no reason to believe he wont make a normal recovery Bottom line is look at this situation going forward You cant do anything about whats happened Make it work to your advantage over the next few weeks Good luck Ill see you tonight with the Upgrade and Downgrade

the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sur e you understand what were talking about is players that are moving In other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Laveranues Coles may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairl y far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or do wn and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Jeff Blake NO Heard a funny thing on ESPNs Monday Night Pregame show The guys said that with the troubles in St Louis the road to the Super Bowl now runs through New Orleans Its been a while since youve been able to say that Blake struggled in the preseason but has become mo re comfortable with each game With a great rushing game featuring Ricky Williams and a star WR in Joe Horn Blakes looking great QB Trent Dilfer Bal Shannon Sharpe predicted that when the Ravens finally scored a TD theyd score a bunch of them The big TE was prophet ic as Dilfer threw for TDs Sunday He scrambled improvised and made excellent decisions A little confidence may be all he needed He doesn t have a stellar WR corps with Qadry Ismail Jermaine Lewis and Patrick Johnson but he does have a great TE in Sharpe and a solid RB in Jamal Lewis QB Brian Griese Den As expected Grieses recent off the field troubl es had little impact to his performance on the field yards and a couple of TDs is strong against a good Jets team The biggest reason for his upgrade though is the smashing return of RB Terrell Davis If Sunday was any indication this offense could make some serious noise QB Shaun King TB With back to back solid games Shaun King is turning some heads He only passed for yards Sunday but squeezed every yard f or all it was worth with TDs He continued to target Keyshawn Johnson even to the point of forcing the ball in places it probably shouldnt have been thrown Its tough to rely on a QB who plays in this conservative offense but if youre thin at QB King might be worth a shot QB Jim Miller Chi Miller clearly gave the Bears a boost with his solid play Sunday Not only was he more accurate than the injured Cade McNown he showed a better arm to boot Millers gain will be McNowns lost and I lo ok for Miller to gain plenty over the next few weeks QB Danny Kanell Atl Kanell came in when Chandler left with a concussion He played pretty well with TDs on yards Chandler look s to possibly miss this weeks game and Kanell could be a nice play against a Detroit Defense RBs Moving Up RB Lamar Smith Mia Hes made this list several times already this yearbut its worth noting how good hes been lately Sundays TD yard day earned him the RB ranking in many scoring systems I dont se e many reasons why he wont have continued success RB Terrell Davis Den In one of the more heartening performances of the day Terrell Davis looked great He showed the power and the burst that weve come to expect from Davis over the years Coach Mike Shanahan said during last weeks practices that Davis looked as good as hed ever seen him After watching the game I have to agree with him RB JR Redmond NE According to coach Bill Belichick and Boston Glob e columnist Frank DellApa Redmond injured his foot during practice and was supposedly going to be limited Sunday Kevin Faulk was unimpressive early and Redmond never looked back after getting a chance Hes productive without being impressive as he only averaged yards per carry on attempts but did get the score RB Jamal Lewis Bal Much had been made of the Ravens troubles but Jamal Lewis had been running hard and effectively Lewis was held out of the endzone once again but he rolled up total yards with rushing and yards receiving If Trent Dilfer and the passing game can keep things rolling I see no reason why Lewis cant hold up his end of the offense RB Justin Watson StL As you know by now Marshall Faulk had knee surger y Monday and will miss weeks Weve had Watson on our Waiver Wire Wonder list for a while as the guy whod get a shot if Faulk went down He was less than impressive yesterday with only yards on carries but he did get the TD Plus coach Mike Martz said the game plan had been designed around Faulk and the skills he brings Look for Watson to perform better with a week to prepare Although Marshall Faulk is the only guy wholl gi ve you Faulk like numbers anytime soon in this offense RB Warrick Dunn Dunn had carries Sunday and he continues to play a bigger role in this offense Its coming at the expense of Mike Alstott It seems strange to see Dunn carry the load but thats exactly what hes been doing After the Minnesota game last week Keyshawn Johnson said he told QB Shaun King that he needed to get the ball to and Johnson and Dunn King evidently listened Makes you wonder whos really coaching this team RB Jermaine Fazande SD Fazande looked to be in danger of losing carrie s last week but he responded Sunday with a nice day carrying the ball tim es for yards ypc He also tacked on yards receiving The Chargers are still struggling but Fazande could be a nice addition if youre thin a t RB WRs Moving Up WR Keyshawn Johnson TB Johnson told QB Shaun King he wanted the ball King obliged and Johnsons made the most of it He only had receptions for yards but he managed TDs on of those catches I dont look for h im to score every other time he touches he ball down the stretch but I do thi nk he could continue the roll You can bet the Bucs wont mess around with whats working for them WR Joe Horn NO Can you imagine if Elvis Grbac still had Joe Horn in KC QB Jeff Blakes certainly glad to have him and Horn surely likes the role of the WR He put together a great game Sunday with yards on receptions WR Keith Poole isnt carrying his share of the load but RB Ricky Williams is more than making up for it St Louis WRs Id look for Isaac Bruce Azzahir Hakim and Torry Holt to all increase their production in the wake of Marshall Faulks injury Synergy can be a strange thing On most teams Id view the loss of the star RB as a negative toward the WRs The Rams have so many passing weapo ns though I think they can carry the team with a lesser RB in the backfield WR Donald Hayes Car Apparently the loss of Wesley Walls can be overcome Hayes made some great plays Sunday Not unlike Keyshawn Johnso n he only caught passes but he made the most of them with yards and a TD He looks to be back on track WR Muhsin Muhammad Car I received a few emails asking how in the world could I continue to rank Muhammad as high as I did last week Hes good thats how Sure the Rams had something to do with his play and the ranking but I like his activity He caught passes for yards Sunday night and should continue to play well WR Derrick Mason Ten I said a few weeks ago that Mason could be the bes t WR on the team Now Im sure of it Of course its a team that doesnt throw the ball very well and when they do throw the TE is the primary target Still though hes a solid contributor and you could certainly do worse at WR His special teams play is a nice bonus if your league lets you double dip the WR and special teams categories WR Laveranues Coles NYJ Coles continues to play great football He ranks as the WR over the last games Keep an eye on him for keeper leagues as his play is very encouraging considering his lack of experience He should only get better WR Marcus Robinson Chi I told you Robinson doesnt seem to care whos throwing the ball and Robinson came through Sunday with yards and a TD New QB Jim Miller definitely gave the Bears a spark and Robinson benefited from it Dont be surprised to see him keep it rolling TEs Moving Up TE Shannon SharpeBal Sharpe led the charge as the Ravens came roaring back Hes clearly the best receiver on the team and you can bet QB Trent Dilfer will continue feeding him the ball TE Ricky Dudley Oak Dudley was a guy who kept raising eyebrows on our weekly cheatsheets Even though he made the downgrade list a couple of times we kept him fairly high on the overall list just based on potential Dudley finally showed some of that potential Sunday with a couple of TDs Its worth noting that he scored TDs in of them came in the second half of the season TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersma seemed less rusty Sunday as he hauled down receptions for yards Flutie will probably get another start th is week and look for him to continue leaning on the big TE Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Donovan McNabbPhi McNabb only completed of his passes Sunday And even for the ones he completed he only averaged yards per completion which is a bad sign He doesnt seem to bemaking the improvements and progression youd like to see from a QB with his experience QB Charlie Batch Det Batch was banged around repeatedly Sunday He eventually left with a concussion and his status for this week will be determined probably by Wednesday Youve probably seen it by now but coa ch Bobby Ross resigned I doubt thatll have too much effect on the offense QB Drew Bledsoe NE Bledsoe suffered a very Brett Favre like banged up thumb as he hit a defenders helmet He was in obvious pain on the sidelines and looked extremely frustrated not being able to play X rays were negative but hes still hampered by it Theyll make a decision on it this week but even if he can go he could be limited QB Chris Chandler Atl Once again Chandler was led off the field lookin g punch drunk It wasnt pretty Danny Kannell actually played pretty well and could get the start this week RBs Moving Down RB Corey Dillon Cin As expected the dream became reality vs a tough Baltimore defense I traded him in my league last week and hope you did t he same Ill say it again a RB can only do so much when there is absolutel y no threat of the QB throwing the ball Akili Smith is world class awful RB Mike Alstott TB As Warrick Dunn becomes a bigger part of the Buc offense Alstott is playing a reduced role Part of the reason is likely his fumbling problems but the effectiveness of Dunn is playing a part Im sure That and Keyshawn said to give it to Dunn RB Kimble Anders KC The featured back in KC had carries Sunday Never ever trust a Kansas City RB No matter what I might tell you in the future dont believe it Theyll break your heart every time RB Travis Prentice Cle Prentice averaged yards per carry Sunday That wont get it done Like a lesser version of Corey Dillon beware RBs with QBs who dont scare anyone throwing the ball Doug Pederson doesnt scare anyone WRs Moving Down WR Johnnie Morton Det Mortons inability to take up the slack for the departed Germane Crowell has been a huge disappointment He came up small again Sunday and one has to wonder what will change in the future WR Herman Moore Det Lets put it this way JJ Stokes is the WR in San Francisco and he had a better day than Moore WR Jacquez Green TB Like Alstott is suffering in the wake of Warrick Dunns success Green is suffering as Keyshawn Johnson commands more attention He only had receptions and simply isnt getting the looks he was earlier in the year WR Raghib Ismail Dal In whats become the uncomfortable norm Dallas ha s lost another WR to knee surgery There was so much promise this Summer wi th Troy Aikman Emmitt Smith Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail Things can change quickly WR Carl Pickens Ten Pickens injured his hamstring again this week I was high on him coming over to the Titans but hes been a non factor Derrick Mason is the best WR on the team By a mile TEs Moving Down TE Chad Lewis Phi After a hot start Lewis has struggled of late as defenses bracket him With no WR to take some heat on the downfield route s its not too hard to shut down the TE Until McNabb and Charles Johnson Torrance Small get going his troubles will likely continue TE Tony McGee Cin McGee should be a nice weapon for the struggling QB Akili Smith but he doesnt seem to be utilizing him as youd expect He caught only passes Sunday The sad part is that almost made him the leading receiver To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Owens can not go Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens SF took part in about of Fridays practice Coach Steve Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not starting Owens Sunday although it seems likely hell play at least some The amount he could play will be determined by how Owens feels at gametime This is so tough to call as hes one of the elite WRs in the game and of Terrell Owens is better than of lots of other WRs People always want numbers so heres my opinion Chances he doesnt play at all Chances he plays but contributes less than his normal numbers Chances he plays and looks like the Owens weve been seeing Weigh that out for what its worth and make the call that best suits your team and situation Hes a high risk high reward decision this week If youre pretty well set and just need a few points out of your WR slot Id probably bench him and find another guy If you need to swing for the fences Id probably be inclined to gamble on him and keep your fingers crossed WR Derrick Mason Ten is

rades Replacing Ricky Williams Contrary to published reports Ricky Williams bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to ESPN The wor d is that Jim Haslett will likely not go outside the team for a back Chad Morton and Jerald Moore will likely be the choices with Morton getting fir st shot Mortons a little undersized at and but so is Sa n Franciscos Charlie Garner and he manages pretty wellMorton came from a big time program at USC and averaged carries a game last year so it s not like he isnt used to carrying the load Well see Dont Count Out Brett Favre According to ESPN Brett Favres foot is much better and he may practice this week Even if he doesnt practice he thinks he may be able to play and keep his record streak of consecutive starts intact Akili Smith Benched Not just benched Benched for Scott Mitchell Tha t s gotta hurt Marshall Faulk Raring to Go With Trung Canidate out for the year with a broken wrist Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may be abl e to play this week Most think thats too optimistic but its nice t o see the desire there Jeff George to StartAccording to the Redskins Jeff George will start again this week at QB Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is BradJohnsons when heshealthy possibly inweek Lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head dow n the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Laveranues Coles may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairl y far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Mark Brunell Jac Im one of those guys who quickly points out Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he receives but you cant deny what Brunell has done lately Behind a beat up line hes standing in there while taking a beating and delivering th e ball Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and paired with Keenan McCardel l theyre one of the better WR tandems in the league QB Kerry Collins NYG A few weeks ago I took some deserved lumps for my early praise of Collins but hes kicking his game up a notch of late He looks more comfortable in the pocket especially in his footwork and drop backs Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing but when hes healthy T oomer and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps Asolid ground game in Ron Dayne a nd Tiki Barber continue to help the passing game QB Donovan McNabb Phi With Deuce Staley gone McNabbs had to shoul der the offense and this week he came through with flying colors The bad ne ws is he only completed of his passes Sunday The good news is he threw t he ball times When a QB airs it out times in one game it doesnt usually bode well for the teams chances of winning but its certain ly a plus for your FF team to see that many attempts With that many chances its like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake attempt s this week or Jeff Garcia attempts puts up Unless you have a really good feeling about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry Id think you ll see him continue to throw often QB Trent Dilfer Bal Remember this list is relative While he may no t be a starter Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and thats what this list is all about He actually looked very good at times in the huge victory over Tennessee Sunday He showed nice poise coming back after basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier Brian Billick did wonders with a marginally talented Tony Banks in and its conceiva ble he might do it here again with Dilfer They play Dallas and Cleveland ne xt but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December QB Troy Aikman Dal When Im bashing Mark Brunell as a Fantasy QB I usually compare him to Troy Aikman Great real NFL QB but not a much f or Fantasy GMs Notice a pattern here After being named the starter Sunda y Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked over t he last weeks Its hard to put too much faith in him but if youre desperate for a QB he could be worth a gamble Tough matchup this week vs Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week QB Jeff Blake NO You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is gone for weeks I hate it for Williams owners Im one but what s done is done All we can do now is look forward And looking forward I see Blake being forced to carry an increased load QB Donovan McNabb threw t he ball times Sunday in the wake of losing RB Deuce Staley and I could easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with Blake throwing a l ot more passes QB Rob Johnson Buf I make it a point to hold my tongue on coaching issues but Ive gotta say I think Mr Charisma with the Spiffy Sweaters Wade Phillips is wrong in going to Johnson In terms of roster management hes hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion But no ne of that really matters as Rob Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he s been named the starter for this week Dont get too excited though Johnson finishes roughly half the games he starts and the next three weeks vs Kansas City Tampa Bay and Miami could be brutal QB Matt Hasselbeck GB Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre this week Remember there was even some talk about trading Favre and starting Hasselbeck this summer when Favres elbow was a big concern Before yo u give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck you should know Brett Favre is reportedly feeling better and hoping to play this week Well keep you posted QB Shane Matthews Cade McNown Chi Again Im highlighting guys mov ing up With the injury to Jim Miller Shane Matthews will be thrust into the starting role The injury will also likely add a little fire under Cade McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have been if Miller was performing well Matthews looked very rusty but its tough to judge a QB when hes thrust into the game like that Id look for Matthews at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then well see RBs Moving Up RB Lamar Smith Mia You have to keep giving this guy his props after another great game Although if youve got an owner salivating over S mith and you can get a lot in return it might be a great time to trade him I cant imagine his value being any higher His yard per carry number d ipped to in Sundays game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal matchup against Tampa Bay in week RB Edgerrin James Ind Its tough to upgrade a guy already near the top but he put in another great game Sunday with total yards and shows little sign of slowing down He averaged yards per carry Sunday and the Colts are leaning heavily on him Watch out for a tough November matchup vs Miami though RB Robert Smith Min Smith quietly is having an incredible year He s put those hang nail injury jokes way behind him as hes become one of t he best RBs in the league Hes running between the tackles for the toug h yards and catching the ball exceptionally well Keep an eye on that tasty week matchup against the Cowboys RB Fred Taylor Jac Jaguar Fans may be distraught but Fred Taylor owne rs have to be happy at least lately Taylors running as well as he has i n his career even if his team is struggling One can only wonder what he d be doing with a healthy supporting cast Hes got two tough weeks coming against Pittsburgh and Tennessee But as everyone knows Taylor has a gre at stretch run of opponents in weeks when he faces Cleveland Arizona a nd Cincinnati RB Jamal Anderson Atl If you didnt know better you might have tho ught you were watching tape from if you saw Anderson Sunday He ran hard a nd with the power and quickness that pushed him to stardom Hopefully he ll be able to maintain that form RB Michael Pittman Ari Pittmans nursing a chest rib injury so ke ep an eye on that but assuming hes ok he has to make the upgrade list He scored a TD Sunday and averaged yards per carry on carries He als o added receptions His main competition for carries Thomas Jones had a yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday RB Justin Watson StL Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed for yards on carries He likely wont be a factor long as Marshall Fau lk is already itching to get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for one more week RB Ahman Green GB With Dorsey Levens troubles Green clearly shoot s up the charts Hes an enormously talented RB but hes got to learn h ow to turn that talent into on the field production After a tough Tampa Bay game last Sunday he faces a soft schedule with the Colts Panthers Bears Lions and Minnesota coming up RB Chad Morton NO With Ricky Williams out for the next weeks the logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC Morton Hes Detroit WR Johnnie Mortons little brother and was reportedly e xtremely close to Ricky Williams and shaken with his injury Hes small but ve ry quick Hes not as big as youd probably like but neither is Charli e Garner Last year at USC he carried a full load as the featured rusher s o hes capable The team hasnt announced their plans yet and bringin g in a free agent is a possibility but Id expect Morton to get a shot first New Orleans has a fairly favorable rushing schedule ahead with Oakland Denver San Francisco and Atlanta all ahead WRs Moving Up WR James McKnight Dal Wow What else can you say but give the man credit catches for yards with a TD is a pretty good day Whether he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you have to lik e what hes done thus far Hes got a brutal matchup next week in Bal timore but he might be worth grabbing to play against the Vikings in week WR Sean Dawkins Sea Excuse us for not getting excited about a guy who was buried on the Seahawks a few weeks ago and had Jon Kitna throwing to him But Kitnas looking better and Dawkins responded with a great gam e Like McKnight the question is whether he can keep it up but hes worth a roll of the dice WR Torry Holt StL I drew a few snickers a month ago when I said I thought Derrick Mason was the best WR on the Titans Im just about rea dy to call Torry Holt the best WR in St Louis And thats no knock on Isaa c Bruce Holts really coming into his own and to be honest benefits gr eatly from the attention Isaac Bruce draws He does face a couple of strong defenses in Washington and New Orleans but Im betting he manages to pr oduce against tough competition WR Derrick Mason Ten Mason is clearly the best WR on the team Partly by default as Kevin Dysons gone and Carl Pickens is injured But partly because hes just that good The Titans had their running game shut d own by Baltimore Sunday and they were forced to the air And much to the surprise of many QB Steve McNair fared pretty well and Mason was a big pa rt of that success WR Ricky Proehl StL Great just what Fantasy GMs need Another Ram WR to worry about Proehl caught passes for yards and a TD Sunday In an offense missing RB Marshall Faulk as high powered as the Rams theres probably room for another WR at the trough WR Patrick Johnson Bal Johnson replaced Travis Taylor in the lineup an d came up big with the game winning TD He only caught passes but understand that hes the rd receiver behind TE Shannon Sharpe and WR Q adry Ismail Still though its a Brian Billick team and Trent Dilfer is pl aying better with each series it seems WR Jimmy Smith Jac With catches for yards I guess you can s ay hes back The Jags may be struggling but Smith and QB Mark Brunell ar e back in synch Ride it while the combo is hot WR Jerome Pathon Ind Terrence Wilkins had a firm grasp on the WR sp ot early in the season but Pathon seems to be taking over there Pathon is playing with more confidence and more importantly seems to have the confidence of QB Peyton Manning He had catches for yards Sunday TEs Moving Up TE Bubba Franks GB For a long while Franks and TE Tyrone Davis had battled for time Its now looking like Franks has prevailed as Davis is seeing very little time Franks made a great catch of the fake kick TD an d is showing some of the athleticism that caught the Packers eye in the draft TE Rod Rutledge NE So much for Eric Bjornson Rutledge seems to be the new TE threat for the Patriots and you know Drew Bledsoe likes to throw to the TE If he can just get that thumb healthy TE Shannon Sharpe Bal After some quiet weeks Sharpe has returned to his place of one of the premier TEs in the game Hes clearly the best receiver on the team and has the confidence of QB Trent Dilfer Just as importantly he seems to have confidence in Dilfer QBs Moving Down QB Trent Green StL Mike Martz said a couple of weeks ago he felt that having Green behind center was just like having Kurt in there We believe him If youre going to deal him nows the time Even as well as hes been playing the league MVP Warner does not lose his job to a broken hand The team is talking about December as a possible date hell be back b ut I ve heard even sooner Regardless you have to figure his days are numbered Plus upcoming games against Washington and New Orleans in the next two weeks could pose a threat QB Doug Flutie Buf Right or wrong Flutie takes a seat as Rob Johnson s been named the starter this week Hold onto him though as Ive got to think the chances of Johnson staying healthy for long are slim QB Drew Bledsoe NE So much for the Boston Globes Bill Belichick conspiracy that Bledsoe would miss several weeks Still though you could clearly see he wasnt with the thumb QB Brett Favre GB As you know Favre suffered a sprained foot against Tampa While everyone was shouting about how many weeks hed miss Fav re told anyone whod listen today that he looked to be ready for this week s game against Indianapolis Players are notoriously optimistic so keep an eye on it QB Elvis Grbac KC Dont get me wrong Grbac is still a top QB He just showed Sunday hes human He really should have done more against San Francisco though On a side note didnt he say hed shave that goo fy beard when they lost QB Brian Griese Den Its the rd quarter of the Monday Night game a s I type this and its pretty obvious Brian Griese is at less than arm strength Keep an eye on this Hes a gutsy kid and has played throu gh a lot but it does seem to be affecting his play QB Charlie Batch DetAnother game another less than impressive performance Batch just seems to struggle to get anything done QB Akili Smith Cin Ive been ripping this guy for weeks and now I fe el sorta bad for him as hes been benchedfor Scott Mitchell Thats gotta hurt QB Jim Miller Chi Talk about blowing an opportunity Miller had been moving the Bears and looked to be the spark Chicago was missing with Cade McNown And then Mr Achilles decided he didnt want to participate Nasty injury and too bad as he was showing promise RBs Moving Down RB Charlie Garner SF Garners been a regular on the upgrade list an d he had another huge game Sunday where he posted total yards with a TD against the Chiefs Two big days loom on the horizon though I promise you hell be shut out in week he has a bye And then he faces San Diego and New Orleans in week and Hes a great player and one of the best RBs in the game but hell be facing some tough matchups coming up RB Ricky Williams NO As I reported yesterday to our email subscribers Ricky Williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss weeks I had to chuckle watching Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett talk about how Ricky doesn t play defense and didnt make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an d about how Rickys just one guy and theyll be fine Yada yada yada That sounds good Jim but youre in for a rude awakening if you really believ e that I dont think he does Chad Morton will be the likely replacemen t Jerald Moore will get a shot too RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka Car yards per carry will not get it done f or a featured RB in this league and thats exactly what Biakabutuka posted Sunday Hes got to get back on track if the Panthers are to be effect ive as a team RB Mike Alstott TB It seems as if Alstott is less of a factor every game He only had rushing attempts Sunday for yards If I were him Id pay Keyshawn to tell the coaches I needed some carries RB Emmitt Smith Dal What a disappointing game vs the Bengals Sunday Smith fumbled early on what should have been a sure TD and never seemed to recover I thought hed carry the load for a struggling Aikman Turne d out the other way around RB Shaun Alexander Sea So much for the idea of coach Mike Holmgren throwing in the towel for and starting the young players like Alexander The rookie is a fine player and will get his time but for now it doesnt seem to be happening anytime soon RB Trung Canidate StL Canidate broke his wrist Sunday and will miss t he rest of the season I have no idea how the Rams will function without him WRs Moving Down WR Marvin Harrison Ind Is it just me or is Marvin Harrison getting mor e and more quiet with each game He only had catches for yards Sunday and didnt seem to be a big factor Hes still one of the best WRs out there but Im worried about his production WR Terry Glenn NE Glenns faded down the stretch and the Bledsoe th umb injury wont help his play one bit Dont be too down on him as he d oes have some favorable matchups on the horizon But if Bledsoe cant go its trouble for Glenn WR Marcus Robinson Chi The loss of QB Jim Miller is huge The Bears ar e now with their QB and you can only expect so much Robinson will make any QB better but theres only so much he can do WR Antonio Freeman GB Freeman appears to be headed toward the path he was on a few weeks ago mediocrity And that was with a healthy Favre With aless than healthyFavre it could be worse WR Jacquez Green TB Keyshawn Johnsons gain is Greens loss as Q B Shaun King seems locked in on Johnson Green will still catch the occasional lo ng ball but it appears for now hes the clear cut WR WR Terrence Wilkins Ind Suddenly Terrence Wilkins is the forgotten ma n in the Colts passing game For some reason Peyton Manning just isnt giving him the looks TEs Moving Down TE Kyle Brady Jac Bradys still a solid TE but with the return of J immy Smith its clear that he wont be the big target he had been TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersma was a total non factor in Sundays g ame catching only pass for yards One has to think the QB shuffle could have an effect TE Itula Mili Sea Milis yielded his starting TE job to Christian F auria and Fauria seems fairly intent on keeping it Mili may be a contributor bu t it looks like he wont see

Denver QB Brian Griese made my Downgrade list in the Upgrades Downgrade article According to John Clayton of ESPN Grieses shoulder injury is a separation of the AC joint in his right clavicle He took a pain killing shot and finished the game Unfortunately his status for this weeks game against San Diego is in doubt At this point coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will be a couple of days before they decide what theyre doing Ive copied the entire story below if youd like more details Sounds like this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket because he could hear the crowd hold its breath is classic Ill keep an eye on it for you as this shakes out Joe From the article nflnewshtml DENVER Brian Griese had a secret Mike Shanahan knew because he was the head coach Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of his right shoulder His teammates didnt know what went on behind closed doors in Mondays dramatic Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium All his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an illadvised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasnt missed The Raiders had an play fieldgoal drive that lasted six minutes Teammates saw Griese trot back to the field warm up and miss only five plays They didnt hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and needed a paindeadening shot to finish the final three quarters This is not a game I wanted to miss and I was going to do anything possible to get in the game and help my team win Griese said I was going to do it It was just the will to play and the will to win and I wasnt going to come out An hour after the game Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran their huddle had a busted wing His performance was John Elwaylike for courage but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese available as a starting quarterback for Sundays game against the San Diego Chargers We wont know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury but hes such a competitor Shanahan said Hes been like that since hes been here He wants to play and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure he doesnt further hurt himself Thats the kind of guy he is Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy Last year was different In the preseason it was supposed to be Bubby Bristers team but Shanahan named Griese the starter Veterans didnt feel totally comfortable with him Griese didnt feel comfortable bossing around a group of players who didnt take to him Brians the one to lead us Smith said I think it would have hurt him more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing with the shoulder the way it was Whatever he does he doesnt surprise me Hes the best quarterback in the NFL I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon is We think Brian is Griese told his offensive players that he didnt have too much zip on the ball They accepted it as just humility I wasnt throwing the ball as well I have been Griese said Some of the balls just died At that point it was just your will to play your will to win I wasnt coming out of the game Griese was of for yards with a separated shoulder Hed throw passes and hear as well as feel his shoulder popping in and out I knew there was something wrong with it but they assured me that I couldnt do any further damage Griese said It was just whether I could handle the pain Being injured didnt make Griese shy away from contact Several times he took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High Stadium grass Once cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the blindside Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high Believe it or not the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I heard the crowd and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that Griese said I said to myself Well somebody must be ready to hit me Talk about homefield advantage Griese has never had an injury like this He has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that requires surgery but this was much more painful Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big play He had to make just an armthrough pass It was agonizing He threw a skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the chin I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I didnt have any zip on the ball Griese said Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different We knew it was something that was hurting him we knew he was banged up fullback Howard Griffith said Thats how it is when youve got a job to do Still the story told after the game amazed them To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Please note see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank playersand to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software f or more info The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position numbers are from ESPNcom Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Raider Defense Gut check time for the Sain ts as they deal with life after Ricky Most folks know Im big on synergy which is just one of those words for depending on your teammates Everyone knows that RBs need a decent passing game to be effective on the ground Im beginning to think however that the effect isnt quite as pronounced in reverse In other words I dont believe losing Ricky Williams will hurt QBJeff Blakeas much as losing Jeff Blake would have hu rt Ricky Williams With RBs Chad Morton andJerald Moorein the backfield I look for Blake to air it out against a suspect Raider pass defense Basically like Donovan McNabb is doing in Philadelphia Over the last weeks Oakland ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB WR Joe Hornis by far the favored target while Keith Pooleand Willie Jacksonmay grab a few TE Andrew Gloveris worth a shot if youre in a bind but hes been very inconsistent Atlanta Passing Game vs er Defense The er defense squashed Elvis Grbac owners last week but Im not quite ready to appoint them QB Killer s Theyve been awful for the year up until then Over the last four week s they rank in passing yards allowed per game And they rank for t he year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB QB Chris Chandleris back among us now and the cobwebs seem to be cleared WR Terrance Mathisis by far the best receiving choice although its worth noting th at Shawn Jeffersonhad a great game against this er team back in week doesnt that seem like a long time ago TE Reggie Kellycould be wor th a long shot as the ers rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing TEs although Kelly has done very little of late Minnesota Passing Game vs Panther Defense Im running out of adject ives to describe the stellar play of QB Daunte Culpepper And I think hell keep it rolling this week against a Carolina team that ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Culpepper creates some matchup problems I dont think the Panthers can solve Of course he ll be throwing to the best WR tandem in the game and that never hurts Both Randy Moss and Cris Carterare sure starters in any league Both have a great chance every week of exploding Id even consider WR Matthe w Hatchetteif youre in the gambling mood in a very large league The T Es arent much of a factor here and when they are the receptions are spre ad around Washington Passing Game vs Ram Defense Jeff Georgegets another start i n place of the injured Brad Johnson after a less than earth shaking performance in week vs Arizona yards TD interceptions Fortunately he gets to face a St Louis pass defense thats still givi ng up lots of yards even with Bud Carson helping out They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks And for the year they ra nk in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB As much as the Redski ns would like to control the game with RBStephen Davis you just have to think theyll be forced to throw in order to keep pace with the Rams A bye week should help things WR Albert Connellhas been the source of great frustration for many Fantasy GMs but this should be a good week for him James Thrashis covering the WR job and he might be a good roll of the dice as well TE Stephen Alexanderdoesnt seem to produce the numbers you d think he would in this offense partly because FB Larry Centerscatches so many short passes that might have gone to the TE Carolina Passing Game vs Viking Defense Im looking for a uptick from QB Steve Beuerleinin this one Call it a hunch as he does have some negative s going his way with injuries to his supporting cast RB Tshimanga Biakabutukais iffy FB William Floydis out and center Frank Garcia abrasion to his eye and offensive lineman Matt Campbell thigh contusion also were injured during the New Orleans loss Coach George Seifert is hopeful both can go Sunday On the plus side hes got two physical W Rs in Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad that could give the vulnerable Viking CBs trouble He should have more time to throw this week against a Viking defense thats only recorded sacks in the last games For the year Minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game The TE situatio n is still shaking itself out as Kris Mangum looks to be healthy Only thin g for certain is no one has really stepped in to fill the Wesley Walls void Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Green Bay Passing Game vs Colts Defense First off this assumes Brett Favrecan get healthy If he can I like the matchup against a Colt team that seems to play just good enough to win For the year they rank i n passing yards allowed per game It should be noted theyve played be tter lately though ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Indy seems to jump out early and force the other team to pl ay catchup which they often come close to doing Favres struggled with his RBs his WRs and his own health but this could be a game he surprises He s kind of a storybook guy and this would be a great chapter in the b ook Well see RB Ahman Greengets the start but he must get his fumbling under control WR Antonio Freemanis a likely starter in your league although so rt of like Favre he hasnt produced like many thought he would Bill Schroedercovers the WR and he often sees more passes thrown his way than does Freeman Bubba Franksis coming on at TE and could be a nice play Buffalo Passing Game vs Chief Defense Most folks know Im not a big Rob Johnsonfan but hes got a good matchup this week against a KC defense th ats been awful defending the pass Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB although theres a chance DE Eric Hick s will be back this week after missing time with a bad knee and that will he lp the pass rush he didnt practice Wednesday though Johnson will be throwing to one of the games best WRs in Eric Moulds Not only is Mould s ultra talented but he draws by far the most targets on his team Sharing is great for kids but you like for your Fantasy WRs to be ball hogs Peerless Priceand Jeremy McDanielpick up the scraps RB Sammy Morrisis hobbled so watch that as hes a solid receiver as well TE Jay Reimers mahas been a real disappointment lately although the Chiefs are awful against TEs where they rank just in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE Miami Passing Game vs Jets Defense I dont know if this will be anot her shootout like they had in their matchup earlier this season but the potential for the Dolphins to score some points is definitely there The Jets rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks QB Jay Fiedlershould have plenty of options available as the Dolphins are finally getting WRs healthy Leslie Shepherdand Oronde Gadsdenhave bee n playing well but Tony Martinand OJ McDuffieare now in the mix Hes probably the least physical of the bunch but Ive got a pretty good fee ling for Shepherd here even though he may not start with Martin healthy The smashing success of Lamar Smith is carrying this offense so dont look for too much through the air for Miami Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense QB Shaun Kinglooks to continue t he roll against a Bear team that doesnt know which way its headed T he Bears are decent defending the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per ga me over the last four weeks but for the year they rank in Fantasy Point s allowed to the opposing QB Kings playing with confidence and will l ikely keep focusing on getting the ball to Keyshawn Johnson something I learned from Sporting News Dan Pompei this week about Johnsons num ber As you probably know Receivers have to wear numbers in the s As a Je t rookie all the s were taken so they allowed him to have It wa s such a hit with the fans and NFL Properties chaching that even when a number in the s came available the league granted Johnson an except ion to keep It is a cool number for a WR Ill admit This week Johnso n should continue to have success against a suspect Bear Secondary Jacquez Greenhas really dropped off with Kings new found attraction for Keyshaw n wasnt going near Johnson in that sentence RB Warrick Dunnis a nice threat catching the ball and TE Dave Mooreis a steady performer Philadelphia Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Arizonas offense is in shambles with injuries all around The trouble is these guys werent very good to start with now theyre hurt too What this means is that the Eagles could see lots of offensive action this week if the Cardinals can t do anything when they have the ball Arizona ranks over the last fo ur weeks in passing yards allowed per game But that number will probably worsen if QB Donovan McNabbkeeps throwing the ball times a game as he d id Sunday Philadelphia may be struggling to find a running game but they re making up for it through the air Aeneas Williams is a tough cornerback b ut he cant cover everyone Torrance Smalland Charles Johnsonshould see plenty of action RB Stanley Pritchettcatches the ball very well and I keep thinking TE Chad Lewiswill break out of his slump Indianapolis Passing Game vs Packer Defense Green Bays been pretty t ough of late ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks but for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Peyton Manningsnot a guy wholl go wild for you in the stat column but I like this matchup The Packers have a couple of defensive players either hobbled or out and Manning should have time to throw Thats dangerous WRMarvin Harrisondraws the majority of passe s from Manning and thats just the way we like it Jerome Pathonseems t o have taken the job away from Terrence Wilkins Both Marcus Pollardan d Ken Dilgerare solid TEs and Id feel ok starting either in leagues that required one Of course RB Edgerrin Jamesis a huge asset catching the ba ll out of the backfield Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way New England Passing Game vs Bengal Defense The Bengals are playing harde r for new coach Dick LeBeau but their pass defense and secondary is still fairly porous Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Although for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB This week the health of Drew Bledsoes ri ght thumb is on everyones mind He says hell play and is calling it not an issue Well see Troy Aikman hobbled onto the field last week a nd lit this Bengal team up If Bledsoes healthy he could do even better T erry Glenn and Troy Brown are the prime guys with Glenn still the main target He showed an upswing last week after a few worrisome games He just sign ed a nice contract so lets see if he can start earning it TE Eric Bjor nson fell quickly He was starting a few weeks ago and now hes unemployed Rod Rutledge is the new TE and would be a great pickup if hes available He caught passes last week including a TD Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense Its hard to get too excite d about Kordell Stewartthrowing the ball but this is a decent matchup for him Jacksonville ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Last week they let Seattle roll up the yards and Jon Kitna is hardly Peyton Manning WRs Hines Ward andCourtney Hawkinsare the new starting W R tandem and itll be interesting to see if benching st round underachiev er Plaxico Burressmakes any difference Truthfully youre reaching if y oure digging down for these guys though RB Jerome Bettisis the only viable starter on this offense unless youre in a really big league New York Jets Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense After the Indy loss last week coach Al Groh was giving votes of confidence to Vinny Testeverde Thats usually not a good sign But remember the last time these teams met Vinny went wild with yards passing and TDs Miami recovered nicely from that meltdown and has only allowed TDs in the last games The Dolphins boast two of the best corners in the game in Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain Madison can shut anyone down and Wayne Chrebetwill have his hands full although he had a great game in the first matchup Dedri c Wardis the WR but I like the rookie Laveranues Colesto do some nice things here Worth a shot maybe if youre strapped for WRs Miami has enough faith in theirCBs that they often leave them on the island in man coverage which can lead to a big play TE Anthony Bechtis showing some nice flashes Like Green Bays Bubba Franks it took a little while to get these big guys going Kansas City Passing Game vs Bill Defense Im guessing QB Elvis Grbaccomes out of the chute firing The Chiefs desperately need this game and its clear to see that Grbac winging the football gives this team t he best chance of winning The Bills play a solid pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and ranking i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year TE Tony Gonzalezremains the focal point of the offense although the Bills rank in the league in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year WRs Derrick Alexanderand Sylvester Morrismake a solid tandem and RB Tony Richardsondoes a nice job receiving out of the backfield although you never know what coach Gunther Cunningham will do with his RBs San Diego Passing Game vs Bronco Defense Remember that the Bengals spanked this Denver team so anything can happen This time of year I ge t a fair amount of email from owners with great rosterswho have to decide between QBs like Peyton Manning or Daunte Culpepper Thats great Think about poor Mike Rileyhes got to decide between Jim Harbaughand Ry an Leaf Harbaugh said hes ready to go and is calling his injury a mild hernia He was named the starter early in the week But with Rileys r ock solid management style hes now starting Leaf Im not sure it re ally matters TE Freddie Jonesis the only viable starter on that team but he s pretty darn good ranking in my TD Performance league over the last three weeks Denver ranks just in in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year so he could do some damage here Both QBs will throw to him so it really doesnt matter who gets the nod WRs Curti s Conwayand Jeff Grahamare too inconsistent to get excited about Oakland Passing Game vs Saints Defense Both these teams took a beating last week with the Raiders losing a heartbreaker to Denver and the Saints losing their star RB Ricky Williamsto a broken ankle The Saints have actually been pretty weak on pass defense lately ranking in passing yards allowed per game They are better for the year where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Itll be interesting Q B Rich Gannon will be scrambling and improvising as usual WR Tim Brownis the primary target but James Jettand Andre Risonwill see some action as well Hes up and down but TE Ricky Dudleymight have a chance as New Orleans ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year RB Tyrone Wheatleyis looking very questionable for this week with two sprained ankles which will probably force Gannon to throw more St Louis Passing Game vs Redskin Defense We see it every year it seem s yet so many teams fail to heed the wisdom of acquiring a solid backup QB Both real NFL teams and Fantasy teams need one to be successful Kurt Warner is getting antsy on the sidelines so you know QB Trent Greenwants to shine for another game or two before turning the keys to the car back over Make no mistake Green wants to win for the Rams but he knows hes play ing for a contract Green will be a starter somewhere in and with every TD his negotiating power is strengthened He should fare well even though Washington is a tough defense Partly due to the loss of RB Marshall Faulkwhere Green will likely be forced to the air often as if he needs a reason to pass Faulk made a bit of noise about returning for this g ame and he did practice some Thursday Even if he does play its hard to envision him as a real factor The trouble with St Louis is picking the WR s that will score each week Isaac Bruceand Torry Holtare the two best choices but AzZahir Hakimand Ricky Proehlare not bad options either An d just for good measure TE Roland Williamshas been effective Washington s secondary featuring Deion Sanders Champ Bailey and Darrell Green are a superb unit but theyll have their hands full with St Louis Baltimore Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Dallas shut down the Bengal passing game last week Now thats something to be proud of This week theyll face a rejuvenated Baltimore passing game thats flying high QB Trent Dilferis doing a great Tony Banks impression as coach Brian Billick breathes life into another troubled career His primary target i s TE Shannon Sharpeand I dont think that will change for this week Dal las only ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE so he could blow up For opposing QBs Dallas ranks in Fantasy Points allowed pe r game for the year WRs Qadry Ismailand Patrick Johnsonare decent plays a s well against a secondary that will be without Cheatsheetsnet honorary captain enforcer George Teague whos gone for the year That will be a factor as Teagues a leader on the fieldStill though as poor as the Cowb oy run defense has been youd have to think the Ravens will focus on runn ing the ball with Jamal Lewis Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Chicago Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Lets put it this way T ampa Bay held the Packers to yards passing last week Shane Matthews wil l start for the Bears Ive seen Shane Matthews play and hes no Bre tt Favre Hes not even a Matt Hasselbeck The Bears are in shambles lo sing another gameto Buffalo and losing another starting QB to injury Offensi ve Coordinator Gary Crowton is rumored to be headed to Brigham Young and many fans arent sad to see him talk about going In fact some wish he d stop talking about and just go already This could get ugly for Matthews Although it should be noted the Bucs have a tougher reputation than thei r numbers would support Over the last four weeks they rank just in passing yards allowed per game They rank in in Fantasy Points allow ed to the opposing QB for year Solid numbers but not quite as dominating a s Warren Sapp would have you believe Still though Id shy away from mos t all the Bears this week Id maybe roll the dice on Marcus Robinsoni f you needed a WR but its sketchy at best In fact Matthews seemed to loc k in on Eddie Kennisonlast week instead of Robinson when he was thrust into action Whether this is a real tendency remains to be seen but Id be hesitant to bank on any of these guys too heavily this week Detroit Passing Game vs Giant Defense I have never liked Charlie Batch I think it stems from the fact he looks like Otis Sistrunk but bottom line is Ive never been comfortable with the guy Im getting less comfo rtable with each week it seems Sunday Batch faces a tough Giants defense that has CB Jason Sehorn back They rank over the past four weeks in passing yards allowed per game Sehorn and CB Dave Thomas are both big players who give up very little physically to WRs Johnnie Morton andHerma n Moore Moore seems to be finally waking up Hell likely face Thomas who s not nearly as good as Sehorn TE David Sloanhas a shot as the Giants rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year but ke ep an eye on him as hes questionable hamstring back New York Giant Passing Game vs Lion Defense Detroit may be struggling to throw the ball but theyre doing a pretty good job defending the pass They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks I like QB Kerry Collinsbut hell need some healthy receivers to do anyth ing Ike Hilliardis good to go but both Amani Toomerand Joe Jureviciuswere talking gibberish on the sidelines Sunday after suffering concussions Bo th seem likely to play but you have to wonder how effective theyll be The Lions are much more vulnerable against the run so its conceivable the Giants could go with heavy doses of RBs Ron Daynewith some Tiki Barbermixed in for this one San Francisco Passing Game vs Falcon Defense Im still a huge Jeff G arcia backer but Im not too high on this matchup vs the Falcons Especially with WR Terrell Owenslooking less likely to play as the week progresses The good news is that Jerry Ricelooks to be ok for Sunday Atlanta ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so theyre solid The secondary ranks nd in the league with interceptions They re not as tough for the year though where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Atlanta has sacks in the last games so theyre getting decent pressure on the QB The key as I see it will be developing the running game with Charlie Garner Hes having a great y ear running and receiving the ball Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Cleveland Passing Game vs Titan Defense The worst thing that could hav e happened to the Browns was for the Ravens to spoil the Titans perfect record at home last week Im betting you see a fired up defense this week that could spell doom for QB Doug Pedersonand the Browns Tennessee ran ks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year Pederson s been painful to watch and it wont be any prettier this week WRs Kev in Johnsonand Dennis Northcuttwill see most of the work but Id have a t ough time feeling very good about starting either In fact you can pretty much just skip the Cleveland team this week Cincinnati Passing Game vs Patriot Defense I doubt youre still interested in Fantasy Football in week if you have many Bengals on your roster Heres all you need to know Scott Mitchellvs Bill Belichic k Belichick may have his faults but hes the master at confusing a QB It could get ugly On the flip side theres always that shred of hope Mitchell returns to his form and lights it up But I kinda doubt it Outside of Corey Dillon WR Peter Warrickis the only other possible FF starter on offense Warricks always worth a roll of the dice just for his big play potential Arizona Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This is almost unfair The Cardinals are already one of the worst teams in the league Now they hav e to deal with Center Mike Gruttadauria is done for the year WRs David Bostons hamstring is worse than it was last week when it was bad and Frank Sanders has a serious knee bruise RB Michael Pittmans ribs ar e killing him and Thomas Jones has walking pneumonia Good grief If someone goes to jail and has their wife leave them itll be a Country Western song Unless youre desperate Id avoid all the Cardinal s this week against just about any team Much less the Eagles who are playing very good defense right now Jacksonville Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The above three offenses Cleveland Cincinnati and Arizona make the Slam Dunk list because the offenses are awful The Jags are struggling with injuries still but they land here because the Steelers are playing excellent defense Pittsburgh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year Remember it was against the Steelers when QB Mark Brunell was benched for Jamie Martin back in week Brunell will throw to WR Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell but Im not looking for a lot from either guy The ga me is in Pittsburgh at night and thats a long ways from Jacksonville both in miles and more importantly temperature TE Kyle Brady has calmed down since Jimmy Smith is back healthy although hes a decent play against a tough defense Dallas Passing Game vsRaven Defense Troy Aikman will find the going tougher this week against a fired up Raven team than he did against the Bengals last week Baltimore ranks for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Over the last four games they rate in passing yards allowed per game Aikman will look for James McNight and Jason Tucker man that sounds weird but dont expect the same success you saw last week from these guys In case you were wondering Baltimore is also ranked in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year so Jackie Harris and David LaFluer dont look good either Tennessee Passing Game vsBrown Defense One of the cornerstone principles of Fantasy Football is you have to understand that the numbers rule It s easy to look at the Browns and dismiss them as awful but in certain areas such as pass defense theyre very good in the numbers department For the year Cleveland ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Over the last four games they rank in passing yards allowed per game The reasons for doing so are different but theyre putting up pass defe nse numbers very similar to what the Ravens are posting In Clevelands c ase teams are choosing to run the ball against their vulnerable rush defense Why risk a pass when the defense is begging to be run over QB Steve McNa ir will be looking to WRs Derrick Mason and Chris Sanders Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen could play but youve been burned enough by these guys already TE Frank Wycheck is still the primary receiver although McNair i s spreading the ball around a little more Denver Passing Game vs Charger Defense After a few weeks of flailing about the Chargers are back at the top of the defensive rankings Over th e last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game where th ey faced Miami Seattle and Oakland Granted thats not like shutting dow n St Louis but holding those teams to an average of yards passing per ga me is strong Theyll be facing new QB Gus Frerotte wholl likely tak e a bit to get settled WRs Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith are both solid Denver s still using the TE set with Desmond Clark Dwayne Carswell and Byron Chamberlain all producing I like all the Broncos and I can see them starting in many leagues Im just not too happy about the matchup this week To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Tennessees Eddie George vs Brown Defense Assuming Eddie George can g et his injured toe healthy and I think he can he could have a monster game against a Brown Defense thats been terrible against the rush For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Th e Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the Ravens and I expect George to take out some frustrations on the Browns Miamis Lamar Smith vs Jets Defense Youll have to look awfully ha rd to find a hotter RB than Lamar Smith In their week matchup he ran for TDs and yards At the time it seemed like a fluke but Smith has maintained almost that pace since then Jay Fiedler and the passing game provide just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does the rest Over the last four weeks the Jets rank in rushing yards allowed per game New York Giants Ron Dayne Tiki Barber vs Lion Defense As you know by now the Giants running game is governed by how close they keep the game Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground game especially Ron Daynes role when the Giants start to trail Against a less than explosive Lions team the Giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of th e way Detroits been weak defending the run over the last four weeks wh ere they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Indianapolis Edgerrin James vs Packer Defense Green Bays allowin g yards rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them Jam es should continue to roll this week against a Packer Defense thats missi ng LB Brian Williams whos out with a knee injury DE Vonnie Holiday may be limited but he looks like hell play and thats some concern but I st ill look for James to romp Baltimores Jamal Lewis vs Cowboy Defense The Cowboys gave up their yard rushing days to quick slasher RBs Charlie Garner and Duce Staley but I m guessing power running Jamal Lewis whos almost as quick as those gu ys will be a great play against Dallas For the season Dallas ranks i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Look for him to catch the ball out of the backfield as well Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense San Diegos Terrell Fletcher Jermaine Fazande vs Bronco Defense Ov er the last four week Denver ranks in rushing yards allowed per game This game smells a lot like the Denver Bengal game to me Winless team comes into town with a big power back and nothing to lose We all rememb er Corey Dillons record setting day and many remember Jermaine Fazande s big day rushing in the last game of against the Broncos Terrell Fletcher is working his way into the mix and thats really muddying the waters Keep an eye on this one and if it looks like one of these guys will garner the bulk of the carries he could be worth a flyer Philadelphias Stanley Pritchett Darnell Autry vs Cardinal Defense T he Arizona defense remains pretty weak against the rush They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB The trick is determining which Eagle RB will get the carries I like Pritchett becaus e hes bigger and can bull doze his way through the Cards Ive been d own on Autry as I believe youre supposed to have the acting careerafter the football career not the other way around Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Eagle Defense Watch this one closely as Pittman is struggling to get healthy with bruised ribs If he can go I like the matchup this week Philadelphia ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Theyre stronger over the ye ar where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Thoma s Jones is in worse shape with pneumonia so Pittman has incentive to get out there Buffalos Sammy Morris Shawn Bryson vs Chief Defense Morris battli ng a bad ankle and looks to be a game time decision Bryson is plenty capable i f he cant go The Chiefs are an attractive matchup as they rank i n rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks They rank i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB for the year Watch this one closely to see if the Bills offer hints to wholl theyll go with Green Bays Ahman Green vs Colt Defense With Dorsey Levens out again Green will be asked to carry the load The Colts are vulnerable to the rus h ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks If Brett Favre can play thatll be a nice boost for Green as the defense wont be able to key on stopping the ground game Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Patriot Defense How much would you rely on Scot Mitchell if you were Dick LeBeau Me neither Whether its Aki li Smith or Scott Mitchell under center its still the Corey Dillon Show New England has shown itself to vulnerable against the rush ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Dillon knows he needs to carry the team and hell do his best His success will depen d on how effect Mitchell can be in drawing the defenses attention toward th e passing game Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way San Franciscos Charlie Garner vs Falcon Defense Charlie Garner continues his great season against a Falcon team thats playing better r ush defense than it had been For the year Atlanta ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB but over the last four weeks they rate in rushing yards allowed per game If theyre without WR Terrell Owe ns again Garner will be asked to carry a little more of the load something h e s gladly done all year Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Jaguar Defense With the WR shuffling go ing on in Pittsburgh I think Bettis is really the only Steeler worthy of starting in most leagues Hes a solid performer though that should h ave another good day grinding the ball out Jacksonville ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they ran k in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Itll be power foo tball as the Steeler just line up and try to run over the Jaguars New Englands JR Redmond Kevin Faulk vs Bengal Defense The Bengal s are tough to predict For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yar ds allowed per game and for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB But they absolutely shut down RB Emmitt Smith last week I look for Redmond and Faulk to have moderate success against this improving unit Redmond is questionable with ribs so keep an eye on this one Chicagos James Allen vs Buccaneer Defense As with the pass defense Tampa Bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing per game For the year they rate in Fantasy Points allowed to th e opposing RBs so its not like theyre invincible With Shane Matthew s behind center and scaring no one though it could be a long day Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Ram Defense As is so often the case th e Redskins could be forced to abandon their running game if the Rams jump out early Washington would dearly love to establish Stephen Davis on the ground but they may not be able to if theyre forced to play catchup The Rams rate over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they check in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Even with Bud Carson helping coach the defense they can be run upon Atlantas Jamal Anderson vs er Defense Jamal Anderson continues to make solid improvement and he seems close to his form to me Hell face a er Defense that can definitely be run on Over the last four weeks th ey rate in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Not unlike the situation wit h Washington the running backs success largely hinges on the ability of the defense to hang tough Anderson can be taken out of the game if the Falco ns cant hold Jeff Garcia and company down in the passing game Minnesotas Robert Smith vs Panther Defense Ive said for years I d love to see Robert Smith play a full season and now were seeing that could loo k like Hes having a great year and I think hell continue to have s uccess against Carolina Theyve been pretty strong lately against the rush ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks bu t for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB If the Vikings can control Carolinas Steve Beuerlein no small feat itll help Smiths chances immensely Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Jacksonvilles Fred Taylor vs Steeler Defense Fred Taylor is beginnin g to work his way out most Fantasy GMs dog house as he continues to be a br ight spot on a team without many bright spots Hes been running hard but this will be a real gut check for him as he squares off against a very tough Steeler rush defense thats only allowed TDs over the last four games Pittsburgh ranks for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposin g RB and Taylor will have his hands full Carolinas Tshimanga Biakubutuka vs Viking Defense Biakabutuka remain s very questionable with a bad toe and the Panthers dont sound very optimistic about him playing Sunday Keep an eye on it as he was able to play through the pain last week Although it seems to be worse this week than last If he cant go youll see undrafted rookie FB Brad Hoov er get the start Dont ask me how that happens Minnesota is decent against the run ranking over the last four games in rushing yards allowed per gam e and for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Bear Defense Most people including myself thought new offensive coordinator Les Steckel would invol ve Mike Alstott more in Frank Wycheck type roles Hasnt happened yet bu t it ll be interesting to see if they start getting the big guy the balls in creative ways Im sure his fumbling problems are still a huge concern but of course thats not something a guy like Tony Dungy talks very publicl y about The Bears are decent against the run ranking over the last fou r weeks in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they check in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Denvers Terrell Davis vs Charger Defense Davis scared everyone this week when it was reported he had a problem with his calf He says its overblown and was calling it just tightness below the knee He ll need to be as healthy as possible this week as the Chargers have been playing stro ng rush defense of late ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over t he last four weeks For the year theyre still ranked in Fantasy Po ints allowed to the opposing RB reflecting some of their earlier struggles Th e Broncos desperately need Davis to shoulder the load with Brian Griese out and itll be interesting to see how he responds Its a tough matc hup but I bet he does well St Louis Justin Watson vs Redskin Defense The good news for Watson is that he doesnt have to worry about Trung Canidate The bad news is Ro bert Holcomb saw a good bit of work at tailback this week and Marshall Faulk is even making noise about playing Monday Faulk did practice some Thursday but coach Mike Martz still remains pessimistic about him seeing much actio n this week Keep an eye on it as Im sure itll be a top story but r ight now he doesnt look to be a big factor The Redskin rush defense is solid ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game and for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Clevelands Travis Prentice Jamel White vs Titan Defense The Brown s catch Tennessee at an awful time as the Titans are coming off a frustratin g loss at home to Baltimore and will likely be looking to vent some frustrations this week Cleveland looks to bear the brunt of that situation Prentice and White have been unexceptional lately and I don t see them improving against a tough Titan Defense Over the last four weeks Tennessee ranks in rushing yards allowed per game They also ra nk for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB These guy s may do in a pinch on other weeks but I dont see it this Sunday Detroits James Stewart vs Giant Defense Stewart is still a starter i n many leagues but I dont like his matchup here Although you can t discount the time he ran wild on Tampa Bay with an awful matchup too The Giants rank for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Thats strong Having a healthy Jason Sehorn back will help the entire defense as it allows more safety help to commit to the run Oaklands Napoleon Kaufman vs Saints Defense Keep an eye on it but a t this point Tyrone Wheatley is looking very questionable with not one but t wo bad ankle sprains His most recent sprain is thought to be worse than th e first sprain on the other ankle that was limiting him already Kaufman struggles a bit as the sole RB and Saints are RB Killers For the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last fo ur games they check in at in rushing yards allowed per game One ray o f hope for Oakland is that DT Norman Hand is questionable with bone chips in his ankle although they believe he can play even though he hasnt pract iced this week Kansas Citys RB committee vs Bills Defense By now you probably know better than to risk starting any RB wearing a Chief uniform This week s a good week to follow that rule as the Bills are playing excellent rush defense They rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game and the rate for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB I shy away from Chief RBs against any team but especially a defense this tough If you dont have any choice Kimble Anders will g et the start but expect to see plenty of Tony Richardson and Frank Mo reau Richardson in particular does a nice job receiving the ball Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Raven Defense Lets put it this way Smit h was shut down by Cincinnati last week And the Ravens are a just a tad bit better than the Bengals when it comes to run defense If anyone can bounce back its Smith but last Sunday was very worrisome The Ravens are f lying high after a huge road win at Tennessee Hes still a solid RB but Smit h will have his hands more than full Sunday The Ravens rank in rushin g yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and for the year they rate in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Dolphin Defense I dont see a repe at of the week meltdown from Miami on defense Martin will have a tough day ahead of him against the Dolphin defense that ranks over the last fou r weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Over the season they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB The Dolphins were hopeful L B Zach Thomas could return but thats not looking too likely now It ll be even tougher for Martin if he does New Orleans Jerald Moore Chad Morton vs Raider Defense New Orleans catches a tough break as the new RBs are forced to make their first start facing the rush defense in rushing yards allowed per game over the las t four weeks For the year theyre not quite as tough ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Its tough to call right no w how the carries will be distributed as the Saints are understandably being tight lipped I expect Moore to carry most of the load to begin with Hes the more physical back and much more like Williams than is Morton who falls closer to the scat back rd down guy mold I can envision somethin g similar to the rotation New England is using with JR Redmond and Kevin Faulk For FF purposes youd of course like to see one guy take over but I dont see that now The other wild card is newly signed Terry Allen wh o sounds excited about football again Well see how quickly he can get comfortable To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Gus Frerotte Den You have to love Frerotte stepping in and performin g like he did Of course when you throw the ball times good things oft en happen When you throw the ball times with a completion percentage great things happen Look for more of the same QB Kerry Collins NYG The Giants may be struggling but Collins continues to put up excellent Fantasy Football numbers With guys like Kurt Warner and Daunte Culpepper its easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs come from great teams Not always the case as Collins is showing Often times its teams with vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco that provides the QB motivation to play catchup Collins looks comfortab le in the pocket and if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard healthy for four quarters who knows what might happen QB Brett Favre GB Hes baaaaack I said last week that Favre coming ba ck on the bad foot would be storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an d Favre delivered TDs and yards have the Packers riding high and believing they canmake some noise WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an excellent WR and RB Ahman Green is filling the void left by Dorsey Levens QB Aaron Brooks NO I may be in the minority imagine that but I was very impressed with Brooks taking over for Jeff Blake He was not a QB like Jim Miller in Chicago that knew hed be inserted any minute Brooks was thrust into the game and responded very nicely Hes skinny at b ut tall Big league arm and nice mobility Of particular note was hi s tendency to throw to WR Willie Jackson Well see if that continues Sur e hes a long shot but if youre desperate for a QB he could be a nice surprise QB Ryan Leaf SD Hold the presses Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade list Seriously hes an easy target and Ill admit to taking my share of shots but you cant deny the guy has skills Yes there were some fluky plays with Crockett injuring himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw although the TDs on completions did make for a wild looking box scor e for Leaf Hes got some weapons in Jeff Graham Curtis Conway and his bes t receiver TE Freddie Jones Hes as flaky as they come but he might be worth a look if youre dying at QB RBs Moving Up RB Fred Taylor Jac Taylor put together one of the best performances of the year Sunday night The fact that he did it against the very tough rus h defense of the Steelers makes it even all the more impressive This isnt like rolling up yards on the Cowboys or Cardinals Clearly theres reason for huge hope as if he can do this against Pittsburgh he can do it against anyone RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis ran hard Hes got to be consider ed one of the better RBs in the game right now I still worry about how durable hell be but hes looked great lately averaging yards per carr y Sunday for yards If it werent for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin g a TD here and there hed be even higher RB Darnell Autry Phi Autry refuses to hand over the RB job to Stanle y Pritchett or anyone else Hes not very flashy but he gets the job done both rushing and receiving The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in the standings and Autry figures to be a large part of that success RB Ahman Green GB Id be a little worried right now if I were Dorsey Levens Green averaged yards per carry Sunday as he rolled up tot al yards Most importantly was his number of fumbles Zero No ones ever doubted his incredible physical skills but now he seems to be bringing th e mental game to go with it RB Mike Anderson Den I hate to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea t impression of Isaac Bruces maddening on again off again season As you know Davis missed another game and once again Anderson stepped in nicely By now you know its tough to predict what Davis is going to do each week so it looks to me as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons yards per carry reminded many of h is season Hes running with power and speed and finally appears to be over the knee injury I think hes been over it physically for a while no w but it seems hes handling the mental aspect too WRs Moving Up WR Willie Jackson NO New QB Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson responded well with catches and yards including TDs Often times youll see a backup QB favor the backup WRs as theyre familiar with them Well see if this continues I m guessing Brooks will get comfortable throwing to Joe Horn this week but Jackson is still definitely worth a shot WR Joe Jurevicius NYG As I mentioned above QB Kerry Collins is playing very well With Ike Hilliard set to miss some time Jurevicius should get a chance to show what he can do Hes long been a Fantasy Football tease showing flashes but never really having the opportunity for playing time Lets see what he can do WR Terry Glenn NE Ive beenhigh on Glenn since June He made me look good early on but had cooled midseason Hes now back warming up again an d for you Glenn owners your patience is paying off QB Drew Bledsoe didnt have a TD but he did roll up the yards Once again Glenn was the prime target WR Jimmy Smith Jac Smith looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as the Jags awakened their offenseSunday night Smith seems back in synch with QB Mark Brunell and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game There may not be enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug h for Smith WR James McNight Dal Yes hes a long shot considering the horrid play of Troy Aikman Sunday but you have to like a WR whos getting a ton of looks And McNights getting those looks from Aikman Cant make plays without t he ball TEs Moving Up TE Jay Reimersma Buf Weve been waiting for Reimersma to return to form and he looks to be on his way He was heavily involved and seemed comfortable with new QB Rob Johnson He can be a vital part of the offense and you have to think Johnson will continue to utilize him TE Kris Mangum Car Mangums no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a nice target catches for yards is an improvement from what theyve h ad at TE and it looks like hes back and healthy now Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Steve Beuerlein Car Theres only so much a QB can do by himself He lost Wesley Walls a couple of weeks ago I thought Beuerlein could handle losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur y proved too much His OL is less than stellar and hes just not having muc h time to throw QB Shaun King TB King swings back toward the side of mediocrity after a yard passing effort against Chicago It looked that bad too Even for a Les Steckel Offense Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a positive as teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson QB Steve McNair Ten Not all the turnovers Sunday were McNairs fault bu t he certainly had a hand in them His problem remains a lack of healthy WR s and a stellar RB in Eddie George who can carry the load Last year it wa s McNair vulturing TDs from George but it doesnt seem to be a problem this year QB Jake Plummer Ari If youre a regular reader you know Im not a Plummer fan Im especially not a fan now that hes hurt as well He may get back soon but it wont matter for this team thats in shambles offensively RBs Moving Down RB Thomas Jones Ari Jones was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but still you like to see a better yards per carry average than negative RB Kevin Faulk NE Either Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is not a very good football player How else do you explain Faulk earning on e carry while his RB partner JR Redmond was inactive Patrick Pass got th e bulk of the work but was ineffective Im guessing its the fumbling tha t earned his spot in the doghouse RB Ron Dayne NYG As weve said so often in the past Ron Daynes productivity is tied directly to how well the Giants are playing If New York is leading youll see Dayne If theyre trailing its the Tiki Barber show Lately its been more Tiki than Dayne And if the Giants dont make some improvements on defense I dont see that changing RB Travis Prentice Cle Prentice got folks excited early in the year but hes been disappointing of late Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit e and that doesnt look to change anytime soon WRs Moving Down WR Marcus Robinson Chi Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it appears the QB rotation is affecting his play With Shane Matthews starting Robinson had receptions for yards While those numbers are certainly not horrible theyre not quite what we expect from Marcus He could improve with another week of practice but Im a little concerned rig ht now WR Joe Horn NO As I mentioned above I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but there is no way that hes anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff Blake Of special worry was the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable throwing the ball to Willie Jackson WR Donald HayesCar Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu s for next week is uncertain Hes a vital part of the offense and will be missed if he cant go WR Wayne Chrebet NYJ As the Jets have struggled so has Chrebet He turned in another small game Sunday with yards on catches These numbers just wont get it done for a WR WR Ike Hilliard NYG weeks ago it was Amani Toomer taking the hard shot Last week it was Hilliard with the highlight hit He looks like he may miss a game or two which is bad news for Hilliard owners but good news of Joe Jurevicius owners TEs Moving Down TE Reggie Kelly Atl Kellys just too up and down to rely on to any degree When hes featured in the gameplan hesa nice player and can be effective Its just that its so hard to guess what game that will be TE Anthony Becht NYJ Another Jet receiver thats struggling Becht is frustrating as hell show some nice flashes and then disappear for long stretches Im afraid to say hes starting to look likea Jets TE To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

and Cats in the scoring box was one of the more annoying moves theyve made this season Cats Thats so lame Enough of that lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head down the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from th e sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these players it s inevitable that some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players th at are moving In other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on t he downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league I t just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewi se a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he s still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make a ll the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Kordell Stewart Pit Time to give props where props are due Kordel l looks like a new man Actually he looks like the old Kordell The GOOD old Kordell Over the last three weeks he ranks as the QB in my Performance TD system based on FF points per game Gotta hand it to Bi ll Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting WRs like that but Hines Ward has delivered Its probably not the best thing for Jerome Betti s owners but Stewarts rushing TDs over the last weeks are huge QB Aaron Brooks NO Brooks made my upgrade list last week and I put my money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league to pick him up last week as a free agent I said last week that wed see how he does with the pressure on all week Obviously this is one cool kid If y ou saw the footage of him in the tunnel before the game he looked like he was ready to go out and play a game of flag football or something He made some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times The obvious comparison is a young Randall Cunningham Hes skinny and has a littl e bit of those Cunningham crazy legs Plus hes got a big arm with that whipp y motion But the biggest thing that impresses me about Brooks is his poise Grab him if hes available in your league I asked my friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks Tony had him ranked higher than Shaun King before the draft Heres wha t the TFY Draft Preview had for Brooks AARON BROOKS Virginia Fifth year senior who completed of his passes throwing for yards touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the ball times for yards averaging yards per carry with five more scores Led the ACC i n passing efficiency two seasons ago throwing for Go od athlete who has shown great improvement in his quarterback skills the last season and a half Smooth and fluid sets his feet in the pocket shows good strength and stands his ground when being rushed Has a live arm ca n thread a needle throws ropes and his deep passes have speed Effective throwing on the run squares his shoulders and quickly releases the ball Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers pulls the ball down running betwee n the tackles While he has improved his accuracy and places his passes wel l he often overthrows receivers The further down the field or out to the flanks he must get the ball the more his accuracy struggles Must do a better job reading and recognizing defenses stop staring down his primary target and not hold the ball so long while in the pocket A player who turned himself into a good prospect with a solid senior campaign Mid to late Sixth Round Thanks Tony Be sure to check out Tonys great info at wwwTFYDraftPreviewcom QB Kurt Warner StL Warners chomping at the bit and has been named the starter this week relieving Trent Green Keep an eye out on how he looks in practice Coach Mike Martz said last week he was concerned about Warner s grip strength and ability to put rotation on the ball Im thinking he ll be good to go QB Donovan McNabb Phi What else can you say about this guy Take awa y his running game No problem Give him WRs that would struggle to make a division I team No problem He finds a way to get it done He looks to me like hes beginning to reach the level of dominance he enjoyed at Syracuse where he was unstoppable Its especially impressive as team s know what hes going and still cant stop him It should be noted th at LaVarr Arrington was injured early and he was the designated spy b ut still it was an impressive performance against a very good Washington defense I see little reason why he wont continue although he really needs help at WR QB Trent Dilfer Bal I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer might pla y the late season Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives anothe r struggling QBs career Dilfer seems very comfortable with what Bill ick is asking him to do and brings a little fire and attitude to the offense that had been missing I like what theyre doing and dont see why it wont continue Although dont forget theyre off this week QB Brad Johnson Was Jeff George yields to the young man from Florida State His knee is reportedly good to go and hes been cleared by the trainers as fit to start Considering the troubles the team endured with George at the helm Johnson has already been named the starter Hell be working with a nicked WR corps so well see how he fares QB Ryan Leaf SD Kordell Stewart Trent Dilfer and Ryan Leaf You gott a be kidding me But after another solid outing you cant deny Leaf is making plays Granted he still throws the ugly interceptions and he ge ts hurt almost as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for you if you need a spot QB Hes got one of the top TEs in the game with Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are veterans who can make a difference This win will have to buoy the spirits and enthusiasm RBs Moving Up RB Mike Anderson Den Once is a coincidence Twice is a trend Youv e got to start handing credit to Mike Shanahan Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia k and that offensive line Like everyone else I marveled at the way Olandis Gary was able to run last year when Terrell Davis went down What a great job of scouting we all thought But hey Gary was a pretty highly touted back But Mike Anderson Andersons a fine back but Ive got to believe its a team deal here The good news is that Andersons team isn t going anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell Davis recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment Watch this during the week b ut it wouldnt surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game And as l ong as Anderson rolls up rushing yards a game like he did Sunday you won t see Shanahan crying over TD being out Granted of those yards came on one big run but he had a great game any way you slice it RB Jamal Lewis Bal Ive been eating crow Raven for a while now a s I was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at this level after a very disappointing season at Tennessee Lewis is running like he did as a Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have the best blend of speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George Coach Brian Billick has the Raven offense firing on all cylinders and Lewi s remains a huge part of it His only down side is that hes off this we ek with a bye But that week matchup against Arizona is looking very tasty RB Corey Dillon Cin Considering what he does with that surrounding cas t I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back in the NFL There have been few passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the Bengals yet Dillon continues to pound out the yards when defenses know exactly whats coming at them Its amazing to watch I dont k now how long he can keep it up but hes got the woeful Cardinals this week and you have to like that RB Warrick Dunn TB Dunn made the upgrade list last week in the wake of Mike Alstotts knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his owners Sunday with total yards including TDs There was some talk about him sharing carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the ball for Tampa Bay Look for more of the same from the Bucs and new offensive coordinator Warren Sapp Seriously Dunn showed he could hand le rushing attempts and I think youll continue to see them go with what s working RB Michael Pittman Ari Pittman may be the lone bright spot on the Arizona team I told you last week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and you saw the results last night as Pittman rambled for yards on only carries ypc Like Corey Dillon the surrounding team kills his value but if he ran for a team that held a lead hed be awesome Unfortunate ly I dont see Arizona turning into such a team anytime soon so dont get too excited But overall I like the guy a lot RB Richie Anderson NYJ Each year there are always unheralded guys who post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners Many tim es they are RBs who quietly post yardage and FF points receiving the ball Anderson is a prime example of one such player this year asare Tony Richardson and Stanley Pritchett Hes caught passes over the last games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus that trend wil l likely continue RB Robert Holcombe StL It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see th at Marshall Faulk isnt Red flags went up across the country when M ike Martz elected to give Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday weeks ago that would have been Faulks carry all day long Holcombe looks to benefit if Faulks workload continues to be decreased RB Brad Hoover Car Aside from having one of those cool names the fans can yell whenever he does something good Hoover has shown to be a capable replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka He doesnt have the physical tools of a Biakabutuka but you cant deny he hasnt been effective It wouldnt surprise me a bit to see Hoover continue to see action WRs Moving Up WR Marvin Harrison Ind Harrison stated before Sundays game that he needed to get on a mission Looked like he started towards that e nd with TD catches and he could have had another Yes youd like to see mo re than catches but Ill take TDs any week Harrisons biggest worr y is that Peyton Manning can stay calm enough not to strangle Jerome Pathon for dropping easy balls Harrison is fine and actually looking better in my eyes WR Hines Ward Pit Does anyone else find it interesting to see Kordell Stewart throwing the ball to another slash type player in Hines Wa rd Ward doesnt have the name of a Plaxico Burress but hes certainly m ore productive If Im Burress Id be for finding a baseball cap that I was comfortable with WR Amani Toomer NYG Toomers back in a big way He had us worried t here for a stretch earlier but hes playing very well right now especially with Ike Hilliard out QB Kerry Collins has settled into a nice rhythm and coach Jim Fassell is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a playoff slot Look forToomer and Collins to be a big part of making that happen WR Sean Dawkins Ind With his size Ive always wondered why he isnt better Hes showing over the last few games that mayb e he is Over the last games he rates as the WR in Fantasy Points per game It doesnt seem to make a great deal of difference to him whethe r it s Jon Kitna or Brock Huard throwing the ball he just delivers WR Peter Warrick CinGarbage time or not he scored another TD this week and hes a great gamble if you need to roll the dice for a home run Y es hes as liable to go for as he is score a TD but sometimes those are the kinds of gambles that pay big The team reportedly was forcing him t o see an eye doctor for contact lenses This could be like Charlie Sheen in Major League with the new glasses Seriously if hes had bad vision t hats been limiting him look out once he gets the contacts WR Joe Jurevicius NYG With Ike Hilliard out Jurevicius got all he eve r wanted a chance And hes making the most of it Hes clearl y the WR behind Toomer but when this offense is clicking the guy has definite value Keep an eye on Hilliards return but he could be a nice sub if you re in a pinch WR Willie Jackson NO Jackson is looking less fluky with each g ame He put together a nice day Sunday with catches for yards Like Jurevicius hes the clear cut receiver but hes certainly valua ble QB Aaron Brooks has surprised everyone and Jackson should continue to benefit WR R Jay Soward Jac Ill be honest I really dont like Soward much but you cant dismiss the fact Mark Brunell seemed to almost be forcing the ball to him on the long throws Hell draw the weaker coverage and rightly so when Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are in the lineup so he could have some mismatches TEs Moving Up TE Freddie Jones SD Jones is still under the radar of a few owners as he plays for the Chargers Truth is hes one of the better receivers i n the game and definitely the best receiver in San Diego Hes a nice big tar get with soft hands for new QB Ryan Leaf Hes had receptions over the last games TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersmas returning to the player we knew he could be With receptions for yards Sunday hes a vital part of the offense With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel not doing much it s pretty much Eric Moulds and Reimersma TE David LaFluer Dal With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained knee LaFlu er seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with catches f or yards and a TD Keep an eye on Harris but this could be a trend TE Anthony Becht NYJ Becht earns the upgrade just for the beautiful diving TD catch Sunday At this point in the season rookies arent re ally rookies any more as most have enough experience that theyre learning t he ropes Becht appears to be a fast learner and could give this team a huge boost with solid TE play QBs Moving Down QB Jeff George Was Audition time is over Didnt you have the feeling owner Danny Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild befor e Brad Johnson sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year i f they ever do that Instead he looked very average and even a little bit old Brad Johnson will get the start this week You never know with knee injuries so George certainly still has value just nothing like he did as a starter QB Trent Green StL Chris Berman made a great point last night on ESPN s Prime Time Trent Green is a nice player but lets forget this talk ab out him being the same player as Kurt Warner Another loss for the Rams pretty much guaranteed well see Warner this week The Rams are sudden ly fighting for their lives and it wont be Green behind center QB Shane Matthews Chi The University of Florida has a great program an d always places a large number of players at the next level but Matthews loo ks to be another shot putting QB that simply cant deliver the ball at thi s level Its a testament to coach Steve Spurrier that he can devise sys tems to make guys like Matthews and Danny Wuerffel look great in college becaus e they clearly lack the talent Put it this way Matthews has Bears fan wishing Cade McNown will get back soon QB Drew Bledsoe NE Whether its the thumb or the WRs or the play calling Bledsoe is struggling I used to blame this on Bill Belichick coming up with a Jets defense that shattered Bledsoes confidence and t hrew him into a tailspin this time of year but now Ill have to start lookin g for other theories As Terry Glenn said it felt like the defense knew exactly what we were going to do Thats bad for a Thursday game RBs Moving Down RB Emmitt Smith Dal As you probably saw Emmitt was knocked out for a moment during the Thanksgiving Day game Check his status this week Ev en he faces a tough stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa Bay Washington New York Giants and Tennessee RB JJ Johnson Mia Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early indicatio ns are that Lamar Smith will be ready to play this week and that means Johnso n takes a seat RB Jamal Anderson Atl It looks to me like the Falcons are very close t o packing it in He may be worth one more start against the porous Seattle defense this week but after that hes got a bye and then New Orleans RB Marshall Faulk StL Understand hes still a top RB but I think h is value is clearly falling a bit He looks less than but the most telling indicator by far was the Robert Holcombe goalline carry weeks ago no way does Holcombe get that carry Hes still a must start and Warner will likely help his stock but Im a little worried RB Curtis Martin NYJ The weather conditions made it tough to get a tru e picture of Martins health but it was pretty easy to see he wasnt Sunday Between Bernie Parmalee and Richie Anderson coach Al Groh has plenty of options and he doesnt hesitate to go with them RB Jermaine Fazande SD The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher and look s to have lost his starting job Not a huge loss as I doubt you were counti ng on him for too much anyway WRs Moving Down WR Yancey Thigpen Ten Drop this guy if you havent already He mis ses games with a myriad of injuries and when he does see the field he manages to drop key passes WR Marcus Robinson Chi One has to wonder what could have been with Jim Miller healthy Shane Matthews managed to get the ball to his best WR a whopping one time Sunday That will not do WR Sylvester Morris KC Morris has been especially disappointing as one usually expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be going the other way Over the last weeks he ranks as the WR in my TD Performance system Part of that can be attributed to Elvis Grbac Warren Moon but hes not playing well right now WR Terance Mathis Atl Mathis ranks among WRs over the last game s in my TD Performance system Thats not what youre looking for fr om a WR even if it is the Falcons Eagle WRs These guys are just not very good I had especially high hopes for Charles Johnson this year but hes not getting it done WR Wayne Chrebet NYJ As sick as I was of Keyshawn Johnson whining abou t Chrebet not being a WR it looks he may have had a point Chrebet just doesnt have the speed or physical size to make a consistent impact w hen defenses choose to take him out of the game I love the guy and admire his grit and determination but he struggles against double coverage And most WR face double coverage TEs Moving Down TE Andrew Glover NO A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats but nobody told Glover about that little axiom The Saints continue to roll in spite of a virtually non existent TE TE Jackie Harris Dal Keep an eye on Harris as he sprained a knee Sunda y and gave way to David LaFluer catching a ton of passes TE Ricky Dudley Oak Hes maybe the most frustrating player in the g ame As soon as you bench him hell catch TDs but I dont know how man y more reception days I can take from this guy To

Luebkes Week Upgrade Downgrade Waiver Wire Picks Before we get to that though let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear From our Message Boards wwwfootballguystalkcom One of our message board members was justifiably frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters My reply to him Dont be down on yourself Thats the nature of the game There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week You did what just about every one of us would have done Im guessing Its part of the game Is it frustrating Sure it is But its still part of the game In my local league last week I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks but not week Aargh Did it play out No it didnt I had guys on my bench who outscored him But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder it was the right call for me I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football You just have to take the best info you can assemble make your call and let the players do the rest Just like a real GM You can only do so much If you got beat because you didnt know Terry Glenn was out and you started him well thats your bad But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life and proven RBs Williams and Green did not well thats not your fault I promise you if you can predict things to that degree you need to quit your job and head to Vegas Control what you can control Bust your butt to know all you can know Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable youve done all you can do After that just enjoy the games Trust me youll be a better owner because of it Ok lets jump to Scotts report for this week Have a great week everyone Joe Upgrades QB Tom Brady Waiver Wire touchdown passes in the last weeks deserves an upgrade in my book More importantly Brady has yet to throw an interception this season When Bledsoe returns from injury the Patriots coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make Theres even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season Right now Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback QB Tim Couch The yardage numbers wont win any awards but the touchdowns in the last games is impressive Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league Keep in mind a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch However with the Browns offense improving he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future QB Doug Flutie The Flutie magic continues to strike Hes not the best fantasy quarterback but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy Flutie should be considered a top quarterback this season With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion passing yards and scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense RB Anthony Thomas The ATrain continues to ride into fantasy starting lineups Weve been hyping him for weeks and it appears hell be named the official starter in Chicago shortly With yards and a touchdown on Sunday can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup I think not RB Trung Canidate Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a filler total yards and touchdownsWOW At the very least hell see more action even when Faulk is back RB Jerome Bettis Bettis has rolled to consecutive yard games Look for this trend to continue With the Steelers defense playing excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers look for Bettis to have more good games as the season progresses RB Michael Pittman We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season With Pittman seeing of the carries and more importantly producing all looks good for Pittman owners Ive never been an advocate of starting Cardinals running backs though After his total yards and a touchdown performance now may be the time to deal Pittman RB Jason Brookins Waiver Wire Terry Allens ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs to become the teams starting running back Hes looked good running behind a pretty solid offensive line but his carries have been limited due to Allens presence Keep in mind the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline Right now Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice WR David Patten Waiver Wire Anyone who rushes passes and receives for a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade With Terry Glenn being bothered by a hamstring injury Patten made the most of his opportunity He has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays which is needed in the Patriots offense Grab him if you are in need of a receiver WR David Terrell Waiver Wire Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with catches for yards More importantly for his fantasy value Marcus Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season The Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears starting lineup If youre in need of a receiver Terrell is the best option in the free agent market if he is still available WR Keyshawn Johnson Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season but he is doing everything else Johnson is averaging catchesgame and appears unstoppable at times However he did suffer a hip flexor injury late in the game and appears questionable for this weeks game WR Johnnie Morton Morton continues to impress this season He has surpassed the yard mark times this season and scored touchdowns With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season Morton becomes the teams wide receiver Morton owners should be happy WR David Boston Plain and simple Boston is bigger faster and better than any defensive back on the field In his first games Boston is averaging receiving yardsgame Keep him in your lineup every week WR Jeff Graham With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson garnering a lot of attention the receiving corps is able to see plenty of open spaces downfield Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season and gained yards on Sunday With defenses focusing on Tomlinson look for Flutie to find Graham for more touchdown passes this season WR Rod Gardner Waiver Wire While Michael Westbrook appears invisible Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field yards and a touchdown with another score called back Gardner is starting to claim the title of best rookie receiver Grab him if he is available in your league Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game TE Bubba Franks Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease because All he does is catch touchdowns touchdowns in games If only he can start picking up yardage points TE Cam Cleeland Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase the total to scores this season With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his wide receivers in the red zone Cleelands value should remain high for a little while longer Downgrades QB Aaron Brooks Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers especially in the red zone With just touchdowns in his last games Brooks is in a minor slump Theres no need to jump off his bandwagon On the flip side an upturn in production is possible over the next weeks as New Orleans faces St Louis NY Jets San Francisco and Indianapolis But for now were a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week QB Elvis Grbac Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once again this week Without a consistent running game look for Grbacs struggles to continue For now Grbac is expected to be listed as questionable for this weeks game against Jacksonville QB Charlie Batch With yards and touchdowns many would think that Batch deserves an upgrade Well if the box scores were the only thing studied this would be the case However the season ending injury to Batchs receiving option Germane Crowell gives Batch a downgrade in my book With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season Batch must rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receiversnot a good sign QB Vinny Testaverde Testaverde was unable to get anything going against the Rams on Sunday With the Rams leading by a significant margin Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time All in all not a good sign for Testaverde owners Testaverdes yardage numbers are poor this season However he has thrown for multiple touchdowns in of his games this season RB Warrick Dunn Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the Steelers Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report this week With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town Dunns owners cant be very happy with this recent turn of events Joes email updates will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news RB Michael Bennett Chapman was able to rush for yards on carries during Sundays game versus Green Bay This is bad news for the unproductive injured Bennett With Bennett failing to clear the yard mark this season his starting job is in jeopardy Keep an eye on this situation RB James Stewart Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sundays loss to the Titans He was limited to yards on carries before leaving the game Expect him to be listed as questionable for this weeks game As more of a straight ahead runner Stewart may be able to play on the injury and be somewhat effective With this weeks game on astroturf the Lions may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to health Regardless any kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade RB Tim Biakabatuka Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for the season RB Terry Allen Allen was limited to yards on carries after suffering an ankle injury on Sunday Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen and looked decent If Allen misses any action Brookins may replace him as the teams starter with one good performance The Ravens are exploring trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline so the Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time RB James Allen Weve been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago Plain and simple Allen has been horrible this season With Thomas gaining yards on carries Allen will be relegated to spot duty RB LaDainian Tomlinson Tomlinson was limited to yards on carries and touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense It was bound to happen that a team would shut down Tomlinson Tomlinson owners should be happy that he received carries despite being ineffective Just a slight downgrade to show hes human Keep him in your lineup WR Marcus Robinson Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for the season WR Germane Crowell Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost for the season WR Terry Glenn Currently Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain that he suffered in last weeks practice He missed Sundays game and witnessed the David Patten Show With Patten showcasing his playmaking skills look for Glenns touches to be reduced when he returns from injury Previously Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense Glenn can post dazzling numbers but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season WR Darney Scott Scotts role in the Bengals offense has seemingly been reduced in the last few weeks After suffering a rib injury that forced Scott out of Sundays game Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a consistent basis With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented nd year wideout from Florida St Scott now appears to be the teams second option in the passing game WR Marvin Minnis Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense since week With Sylvester Morris out for the season Minnis looked ready to take over the role and produce quality numbers With Trent Green struggling at quarterback Minnis fantasy impact has been minimal at best If Minnis is a starter on your roster your receiving corps needs some serious help Waiver Wire QB Tom Brady touchdown passes in the last weeks deserves an upgrade in my book More importantly Brady has yet to throw an interception this season When Bledsoe returns from injury the Patriots coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make Right now Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback RB Richard Huntley Huntley has been named the teams starter after the season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka It was only a matter of time before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again With the Panthers facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week Huntley should pay instant dividends RB Doug Chapman Chapman was able to rush for yards on carries in replacement of the injured Michael Bennett With the unproductive Bennett suffering from an ankle injury Chapman will be given the chance to earn the teams starting running back job Grab him if he is available RB Jason Brookins Terry Allens ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs to become the teams starting running back Hes looked good running behind a quality offensive line but his carries have been limited due to Allens presence Keep in mind the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline Right now Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice WR David Patten Anyone who rushes passes and receives for a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade With Terry Glenn being bothered by a hamstring injury Patten made the most of his opportunity He has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays which is needed in the Patriots offense Grab him if you are in need of a receiver WR David Terrell Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with catches for yards More importantly for his fantasy value Marcus Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season The Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears starting lineup If youre in need of a receiver Terrell is the best option in the free agent market if he is still available WR Rod Gardner While Michael Westbrook appears invisible Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field yards and a touchdown with another score called back Gardner is starting to claim the title of best rookie receiver Grab him if he is available in your league Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game WR Larry Foster With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the season the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup Foster is a talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills If you are in a deep league and in need of receiver help give Foster a shot on your team Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to infoterms

Fantasy Football Heres the scoop Take Hardcore Fantasy Football Junkies and payout in prizes with going home with the winner Live draft in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Casino Where else My friends at Fantasy Sports Publications and Draftsharkscom are putting it on and I gotta say I think its going to be very cool If youre interested in competing in the World Championship of Fantasy Football check out Because youre a Footballguyscom subscriber I wanted to give you an early headsup for this exciting opportunity I talked to Emil Kadlec at Fantasy Sports Publications and theyve already taken over applications for the slots So dont wait too long Hopefully Ill see you in Las Vegas Joe Hi Folks Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your lineups for the stretch run Heres how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against Yes even after last weeks performance The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks Lets get to it Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense Stacey Mack played well last week rushing for yards on carries ypc Hes settling into the starting RB role pretty well Still very quiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume Macks going to keep his job With no playoff hopes it probably makes sense not to rush Taylor back Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense Curtis Martin ran hard last week He had yards on carries ypc plus he caught a couple of passes This might be his week though as the Colts are weak on defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If hes going to explode this is the week St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense Start Faulk End of story Hes the best player in Fantasy Football If it matters and it doesnt the Panthers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Faulks knee was described as puffy after the game but he insists hell be fine and play Although some are saying Trung Canidate will see increased time Hes still a must start in my opinion though Tennessees Eddie George Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense This one hurts Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars the Oakland game with their porous rush defense And then Skip Hicks comes in last week and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for yards on carries ypc and a score Granted those numbers are padded with a yard rush George is such a team player that he reportedly didnt mind Hicks staying in the game as he had the hot hand I think youll see George back this week in his regular role but Hicks could get the call at any time The Raiders have improved on defense Now they just rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Atlantas Maurice Smith Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense Maurice looked a little better or healthier this week but hes still underperforming He rushed times for yards ypc Sunday Bob Christian is clearly going to be more involved at RB He had rushes for yards ypc and a score Christian also tacked on yards receiving At this point Id say Christian deserves a look in larger leagues The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Washington Defense With carries last week for yards ypc I think its safe to say Thomas is back Hes a perfect fit for this conservative offense Plus the Bears defense looks like itll keep them in most games which keeps Thomas involved Hell face a Redskin defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense Its my opinion that Ahman Green owners should just forget about last week Green was held to just yards on carries by a surging Tennessee defense I see very little to make me think this wasnt an aberration This week hell face a softer Brown defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year Cleveland is ranked in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Fantasy Football owners traditionally have memories that last about days I personally am not letting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense Its too early to be talking about Edgerrin James being a product of the system but the truth of the matter is that no name Dominic Rhodes is tearing it up lately Hes had rushing yards over the last games Sunday he rolled for of them on carries ypc and his longest run was yards so its not like he padded the stats with a yarder He caught passes to boot Clearly hes playing at a high level right now and is a must start in most leagues The Jets were horrible early on against the run but have now improved to average ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Englands Antowain Smith vs Miami Defense You know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday when he rolled up yards on carries ypc He continues to be one of the better stories of Over the last weeks he ranks as the RB in Fantasy points per game Smith should have had a TD but went down at the This week hell face a Dolphin Defense thats been soft lately They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Orleans Ricky Williams Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense Williams had a sub par game Monday night and it does seem like Coach Jim Haslett has been looking the other way the last few games He only had carries Monday He did gain yards ypc so he did well when he was in there Some of that can be attributed to the Rams and their offense taking Williams out Although you cant ignore Deuce McAllister McAllister had catches for yards but just one carry The Bucs are nothing special lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Keep an eye on Tampas Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time last week with a shoulder injury Itd be a nice boost if hes less than New York Giants Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense Barber continues to steal the show from Ron Dayne Barber rushed times for yards ypc Dayne only had carries for yards Barber was also the Giants leading receiver with receptions I dont see that changing a lot Seattle is ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Franciscos Garrison Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense Garrison Hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league He ran for yards on carries Sunday ypc You have to be a little worried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both rushing TDs And both Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries Hearst will be a guy who runs up and down the field but it looks like coach Steve Mariucci has more faith in the other guys for the goalline The Eagles rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense Things are looking pretty bad for Michael Pittman owners As we commented earlier the carries allotted to Jones have been creeping up Last week it looked more like a full blown time share with Pittman running times for yards ypc and Jones totaling yards on carries ypc Clearly neither are any good but thats bad news for Pittman owners Of even more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like the short yardage red zone guy The Cowboys rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Its tough right now to put much faith in either guy though even with the favorable matchup Buffalos Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense Travis Henrys tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee Shawn Bryson will likely get the bulk of the work this week Bryson didnt do much Sunday running times for yards ypc He did catch passes Hell likely be better with a week of practice with the first unit The Falcons havent been anything special against the run lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense Emmitt Smith looked like the old Emmitt Smith Old as in version which means not very good He struggled to get yards on carries ypc and generally wasnt a factor Hes an up and down player so realize your taking a chance with him The Cardinals arent much on defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Miamis Lamar Smith vs New England Defense Lamar Smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be effective He only rushed times Sunday for yards ypc That wont get it done Travis Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the Dolphins will stay with Smith for now New England ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Pittsburghs Chris FuamatuMaafala Jerome Bettis Amos Zereoue vs Detroit Defense Amos Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with yards on carries ypc But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for this weeks game FuamatuMaafala ran hard but had little room to move gaining yards on carries ypc And finally Jerome Bettis is in the mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this weeks game Obviously theyre being very careful to preserve him for the playoffs Well try to stay on this story this week for you The Lions are surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense Tomlinson struggled a bit last week with just yards on carries ypc He did add yards on catches Hell face an improved KC defense this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Seattles Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense Its been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with Ricky Watters broken ankle Alexander is back in the saddle as the Guy Look for him to pick up where he left off Last week he rushed for yards on carries ypc plus a TD The Giants have been pretty average lately in stopping the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense Stephen Davis played well last week with yards on carries ypc He was one of the few bright spots for Washington This week he faces a tough but beatable Bear defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Baltimores Moe Williams Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense You know its not good when Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing yards and Elvis Grbac leads the team in rushing TDs But thats what happened Sunday against the Steelers I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the Steelers have a real defense yet Moe Williams logged yards on carries ypc and Terry Allen made a less than smashing debut with yards on carries you do the math Tough to say how itll be split this week but youd have to think Allen will see more time The Bengals arent as good as Pittsburgh but theyre very good ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tough matchup especially since its not yet clear how the carries will be split Clevelands James Jackson Jamel White vs Green Bay Defense Watch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome ankle again He could be ok but its not clear early this week If he cant go Id expect youll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than his share of mistakes Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable Packers who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense We had Holmes ranked last week Im guessing youll see more sites follow our lead and raise him up the charts as well He had a monster game again with yards on carries ypc plus the score Hes a must start against pretty much any defense This week hell face a San Diego team ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Still though I wouldnt let that stop me Do keep an eye on his health this week as hes nursing a sore groin that might limit him Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense Outside of Indianapolis I dont know that theres been a more disappointing than Minnesota Or one tougher to predict each week You get fired up on Michael Bennett and then he cools off Last week he was back to his early season workload with only carries He did gain yards ypc so when he ran he did fine With him its a numbers game Give him enough carries and eventually hell break one But opportunities wont do it And hell face a very tough Jacksonville defense thats been hot lately They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Oaklands Charlie Garner vs Tennessee Defense Charlie Garner had his usual productive day with yards rushing on carries ypc plus another yards receiving The big news was Tyrone Wheatley not getting a carry Looks like Zack Crockett is back in at the goalline Although that can change at any moment The Titans shut down Ahman Green last week so thats a worry They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Philadelphias Duce Staley vs San Francisco Defense Staley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions in the passing game He rushed times for yards Sunday ypc He also had fumbles But on the bright side he caught passes for yards Theyll find the going a little tougher this week against San Francisco ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs New Orleans Defense Youll go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will do anything week to week Dunn only had carries for yards ypc and Alstott only managed rushes for yards ypc Dunn was heavily involved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but thats tough to count on Theyll face a New Orleans defense thats likely smarting from the Rams defeat They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Carolinas Richard Huntley vs St Louis Defense Huntley should be rested after the bye week Unfortunately rest wont make him any more talented The Rams rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this isnt looking good Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense Its strength against strength this week with Dillon facing the Ravens If you can imagine it the Bengals will be hurting without Akili Smith at QB That means Dillon is the whole offense and you can bet the Ravens will be geared up for it On a forward looking note it doesnt get any easier for Dillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon If your trade deadline hasnt passed Id consider dealing him The Ravens rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but I think theyre better than that They rank for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Detroits James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense James Stewarts hip injury may not be as bad as feared He had a solid game in their first victory last week rushing for yards on carries ypc The awful news this week is that hes playing Pittsburgh The Steelers are dominating offenses right now ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to follow Joe Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from

NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Alex Van Pelt threw for yards and TDs with Interception last week He threw a ton of balls toward Eric Moulds although not many were caught Peerless Price is also still a prime target TE Jay Reimersma and RB Larry Centers will see plenty of short throws The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyve pretty much been weak all year defending the pass Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Itll be hard to imagine Quincy Carter leading many FF teams to Playoff victories this week If youve got to go with one Joey Galloway suddenly become Carters favorite target last week Go figure Just when you thought he was locking on Rocket Ismail Both guys are risks Even with Arizona ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Great matchup but I just dont have a lot of faith in these guys being able to take advantage of it Oakland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Yes Brett Favre and the Packers didnt do much against the Titans last week But in my opinion you just cant bench Rich Gannon Jerry Rice or Tim Brown Theyre just too good and are too liable to explode at any time The Titans rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so clearly people are throwing on them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Start your Raiders Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Hard to imagine but Kordell Stewart is carrying Fantasy Teams right now Hes been awesome and isnt showing any signs that I can see of letting up The one factor hed been missing he now seems to have in abundance Confidence Hines Ward wasnt a big factor receiving but hes a great bet Plaxico Burress made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising in the charts The Lions are fired up but still rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Start your Rams Warner Bruce and Holt are sure starters Yes its tough to guess which Ram WR will do well as Warner spreads the ball around But I dont see how you can have either of these guys benched as you could leave a ton of points on the table Carolina ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Cleveland Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Tim Couch evidently had been catching a lot of flak from Browns fans for not being a very accurate passer last week Seeing as how not one of the bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player or ref Id guess the fans might want to keep their day jobs Couch wasnt very effective last week with yards TDs and Interception Normally reliable WR Kevin Johnson came up small as well I still have faith in Johnson as hes shown too much this year to discount him over one game The Packers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Kansas City Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Trent Greens finally coming around Either that or hes just teasing us With the dominant running of Priest Holmes Green is finding room to throw Marvin Minnis and Derrick Alexander are doing well Tony Gonzalez isnt as involved as his owners would like but hes a sure starter in TE leagues The Chargers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Minnesota Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense The hits just keep rolling for Minnesota QB Todd Boumans thumb is causing serious worry Enough that theres talk that Spergon Wynn could get the start Stay tuned on this one Randy Moss has clearly decided to play lately and will wind up with season long stats thatll make all the non Moss owners wonder what all the Moss guys were complaining about early on Cris Carter is definitely taking a backseat to Moss lately The Jaguars rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Jets Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense The Jets are tough to call lately Testeverde threw for yards and did manage TDs But Laveranues Coles didnt do a lot Although Chris Bermans call of Laveranues Coles shopping for yards was classic on the Prime Time highlights Wayne Chrebet was more active and of course Anthony Becht caught the TD but not much else All in all a risky place for FF passing game material Curtis Martin should run wild on this bunch The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Philadelphia Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense The passing game lately has been Donovan McNabb throwing to Duce Staley Thats ok as long as they get the yards Todd Pinkston and James Thrash have been inconsistent Theyll face a er team thats been pretty soft lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tennessee Passing Game vs Oakland Defense I never thought Id be writing about the pass happy Titans but thats the case Steve McNair has been awesome lately and ranks as the QB in the league over the last games Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are starters in just about every league TE Frank Wycheck is producing like always The Raiders rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Atlanta Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Its tough to depend on Chris Chandler but last week he played very well throwing for yards and TDs Tony Martin seems to be coming on a bit We said we loved Brian Finneran and he scored Hes not on the field enough yet to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out there RB Bob Christian is an integral part of the passing game as well This week theyll face a Buffalo defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Baltimore Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Elvis Grbac managed TDs with just yards Sunday night Picking a receiver for the Ravens is as tough as ever with Ismail Stokely Taylor all in the mix TE Shannon Sharpe is the sure bet This week theyll face the Bengals ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Terry Allen should be more of a factor in this one as well Green Bay Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense I cant imagine benching Brett Favre right now He seems to get better as it gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games after losing to Tennessee Sunday Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder both should be ready to play The Browns have been tough lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Jacksonville Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Mark Brunell posted yards TD and Interceptions Sunday Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith were as active as usual Theyre two of the steadiest guys in the league Its surprising but Minnesotas been tough lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Miami Passing Game vs New England Defense The problem with Jay Fiedler is that when hes ugly hes really ugly If you started him Sunday you know what I mean yards TDs and Interceptions wont win Real or Fantasy Games for anyone Oronde Gadsden was injured to boot Gasden said hell be ready Sunday Chris Chambers still has tons of upside if youre ready to roll the dice New England ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Diego Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Doug Flutie threw Interceptions Sunday with TDs Another day like that and hell see Drew Brees finishing the game You might see Brees anyway as theyll want to start taking a look at their QB of the future Jeff Graham and Curtis Conway continue to play well Tim Dwight could miss another game due to his lung problem TE Freddie Jones is inconsistent but if you own him hes probably a starter for you Kansas City ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With yards Interceptions and TDs you can say at least Hasselbeck didnt do anything to hurt the Seahawks Darrell Jackson is the clear guy although Koren Robinson will see his share of passes The Giants rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Johnson threw an ugly game last week with yards TDs and Interceptions If a team finds a way to limit Keyshawn Johnson the passing game is gone Granted most teams have trouble keeping Keyshawn from getting his catches but the over reliance on one receiver severely restricts the offense in my opinion Warrick Dunn saw plenty of passes Sunday but it wasnt enough At this point Keyshawn is the only consistent starter in this passing game New Orleans ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks after the St Louis game Monday night For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Carolina Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Surely youre not down to Chris Weinke are you Even with a week to rest Im not excited about their prospects Muhsin Muhammad might be an option for some teams TE Wesley Walls just doesnt seem to consistently get on the same page as Weinke The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cincinnati Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Dont even go there Maybe Peter Warrick in a stretch if youre desperate but thats pretty much it This team is all about Corey Dillon Unfortunately the Ravens picked up on that as well They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks with passing yards allowed in games For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even so Id still avoid Detroit Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Mike McMahon led the Lions to the feel good story of the week Sunday as they beat the Vikings Hats off to them and their fans They kept playing hard Mike McMahon looked very good and definitely showed some flashes of talent with his scrambling ability He threw for yards with TDs but also Interceptions Johnnie Morton is the clear cut Guy but Scottie Anderson did well too The Steelers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can run on them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Start Aaron Brooks Like you need me to tell you that Joe Horn and probably Willie Jackson are starters in your league as well Looks like Cam Cleeland has taken over all of the work Boo Williams was seeing at TE These guys are hot Ricky Williams reportedly has a hairline fracture in one of his ribs but is expected to play You have to think this will at least throw a little more focus on the passing game though The Bucs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre tough For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Giants Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Collins has been up and down He did have TDs last week but only threw for yards Amani Toomer was the clear Guy with Ike Hilliard apparently hurting Ron Dixon got into the action with a TD but hes inconsistent The Seahawks rank a very solid in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Francisco Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense The ers showed Sunday they can win in different ways as they rode the legs of Garrison Hearst and the RB corps to victory Jeff Garcia did very little throwing for yards and a TD Hell likely be needed more this week Terrell Owens is still his clear cut go to guy Garcia could make the Eagles pay with their blitz happy defense Philadelphia ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Washington Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Tony Banks struggled last week throwing for yards TDs and Interceptions His WR corps of Westbrook and Gardner have been ok but not great lately TE Zeron Flemister did see several passes thrown his way again Hes worth a shot if youre in need of a TE The Bears have improved lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Jake Plummer played decent last week with yards and TD David Boston is a must start at WR For you guys desperate for a TE look at Twayn Mitchell who had catches for yards a TD You could do a lot worse Well see if he can keep that up The Cowboys rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so this will be no cakewalk Chicago Passing Game vs Washington Defense Jim Miller isnt carrying anyones FF Team lately Although his yards and TDs Sunday werent bad Marty Booker is still seeing a ton of balls thrown his way And Dez White is seeing action David Terrell makes the most of what he gets but hes not seeing a lot of passes This team is about Anthony Thomas and smashmouth football Theyll have occasional outbursts of big plays but primarily its Thomas The Redskins have been very good lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Indianapolis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense We got the predicted bounceback from Manning as he threw for yards and TDs with Interception Hes been up and down so lets see if he can keep it up Of course Marvin Harrison is the prime target but rookie Reggie Waynes seeing lots of passes too TE Marcus Pollard was very involved in the game plan last week as well The Jets rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tough matchup New England Passing Game vs Miami Defense Tom Brady continues his slide back to Earth He threw for yards TDs and Interception last week But the Patriots won and thats all they care about Troy Brown is being hurt by Terry Glenns return Brown Glenn and David Patten all seem to be seeing fairly equal number of opportunities The Dolphins are tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs

Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Giants Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense Barber saw more action with carries and yards ypc but it was Dayne who scored with yards on carries ypc Barber was very active again in the passing game The Packers let Michael Bennett run well Sunday and have slipped to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Oakland Defense Martin put in another Martin Like day with yards on carries ypc The Jets may have problems but Martin isnt one Hell face an Oakland defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Oaklands Charlie Garner vs New York Jets Defense The Raiders dont look nearly as strong as they did Garner only had carries Sunday for yards ypc Tyrone Wheatley only had carries This week theyve got a nice matchup as theyll face the Jets ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Seattles Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense Alexander didnt do much Sunday rushing times for yards ypc He ll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense Start Faulk The question will be of course how much he plays but it was pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play Trung Canidate could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went nuts Id say youll get at least a half maybe much more out of Faulk and half of Faulk is worth more than most backs The Falcons rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear cut RB role Thomas Jones steps in with carries Pittman rushed times for yards ypc which was bolstered by a yarder Jones ran for yards on carries ypc This was Carolina though This week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year theyve been pretty soft though and rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense Priest Holmes ran times for yards ypc plus the score Tony Richardson didnt have a carry This week hell face the Seahawks ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Miamis Lamar Smith Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense This is getting embarrassing Smith rushed times for yards ypc Travis Minor had yards on carries ypc Hes becoming less and less of a factor with each game The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find themselves playing a different style of ball than they have been Minors a threat to go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a cheap TD Theyll face the Bills ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing times for yards ypc Hell face a Baltimore defense thats numbers don t back up its reputation this week they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Orleans Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense Even though he didnt score it was a better performance by Williams who rushed times for yards ypc The Saints clearly want him to be more involved as he was Sunday This week hell face a er defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Franciscos Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense Garrison Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just yards on carries ypc Kevan Barlow didnt do much either so it wasnt like he lost time to another player This week he gets the Saints who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense Tampas OneTwo punch continues to work Alstott had yards on carries ypc and Dunn carried the ball times for yards ypc Alstotts been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more involved in the passing game This week theyll face an Eagle defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon showed again he can run on any defense He had yards on carries ypc against the Steelers Hell face the Titans this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so it won t get much easier They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Detroits Lamont Warren James Stewart vs Dallas Defense The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren gaining yards on carries ypc Cory Schlesinger did catch passes though so maybe hes worth a longshot pick there The Cowboys rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense Green was shut down on the ground with just yards on carries ypc although he did score Go figure Hes still too good to sit in my opinion This week hell face the Giants ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so its a tough matchup although I think Id start Green unless you really have a solid alternative Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense Again Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for yards on carries ypc with a score Hell face the Broncos this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Broncos are definitely surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense Mack went off last week with yards on carries ypc and a score Itll be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Philadelphias Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense Staleys receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he paid the price He only rushed times for yards ypc and was shut down receiving with just receptions for yards This week hell face a surging Buc defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tennessees Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense Eddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with yards on carries ypc Plus scores This week hell face a Bengal defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Atlantas Maurice Smith vs St Louis Defense Again Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD He managed just yards on carries ypc Bob Christian stole carries where he gained yards ypc Theyre both a gamble against a tough Ram defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Carolinas Richard Huntley vs New England Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining yards on carries ypc He just didnt get enough carries for this awful Carolina team That wont get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense Thomas ran times for yards ypc Sunday Hell face a tougher defense in Jacksonville thats been awesome lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Thomas is still probably a starter in most leagues but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late Clevelands Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense White only had yards on carries ypc but did score twice Corey Dillon showed the Steeler defense wasnt perfect last week Theyre still tough though ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to follow Joe Bryant

PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Jeff Garcia may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Brett Favre Garcias your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell Stewart combined for passing yards and TDsKitna had of those yards Wow When you throw it times most every receiver will be involved and thats what happened Sunday Peter Warrick was very active maybe the benching helped in week The Titans rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks so this is enticing although you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again For the year Tennessee ranks Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly its a good matchup Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Griese only put up yards passing Sunday but it was enough Expect him to do better this week Rod Smith is of course the man here and hell do well too The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense Manning came up small in the yardage department with under yards Sunday but he did run in one score Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go to guy Mannings a competitor and youd have to think hell give a great effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for The Broncos rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Mike Martz showed last week hell let his guys play Regardless of the playoff situation I think youll see Warner in for at least a half and maybe much more And like Marshall Faulk a half of Warner is better than a full game from most other players Picking the WR is a lottery shot as Holt Bruce Proehl or Hakim are all liable to go off The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense Cant imagine youre in week with many Carolina guys on the roster Weinke did ok last week Its tough when youre upset about Isaac Byrd possibly missing time but thats where they are Both he and Muhsin Muhammad could miss the last game The Patriots rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks so theyre definitely vulnerable For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Its a good matchup simply because New England hasn t been much on defense I have little faith in the Carolina players to take advantage of the matchup though Chicagos Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense When you think its going to be all Anthony Thomas Jim Miller and the passing game decided to show off Miller put up yards and TDs as the Bears continued to roll Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he s thrown The Jaguars rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway deep Galloway seems to be the WR of choice Hes worth a gamble for sure The Lions rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so its a nice matchup It all depends on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it One more thing the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his yard season so that may be a factor Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with TDs and yards Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like weve been expecting He saw times as many passes as the WRs Maybe thatll continue this week The Seahawks rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his yards which isnt bad Chris Chambers Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with catches Look for him to be used more as Lamar Smith struggles The Bills rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Tom Bradys had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense Two teams going drastically different directions here Terry Glenn could continue to make an impact and you know Troy Browns ready The Panthers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Hindsight is but if Trent Dilfer isnt the most under appreciated player in the NFL I dunno who is Hes won a jillion games including a Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw TDs and save the Seahawks season at least for another week The big question is will he get another shot Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play Stay tuned Darrell Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod you have to look hard at him The Chiefs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Jeff Garcia threw for and TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last week Plus he rushed for another TD Terrell Owens is a must start JJ Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved The Saints defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with yards and Interceptions to go with his TD The usual suspects of Qadry Ismail Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active The Vikings rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense Favre came up small last week with just yards and TDs Granted it was really cold but that hasnt seemed to bother him much in the past Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual TE Bubba Franks saw a handful thrown his way Theyll face the banged Giant secondary this week ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with Interceptions vs TD and just yards Its not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading receiver but thats what happened Sunday Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came up small This week theyll face a er defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Stewart threw for yards and TDs Sunday although he did have Interceptions Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is showing shades of becoming a dominant WR Hines Ward is solid as well The Browns rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Steve McNair continues to play well with yards and TDs Hes a totally different QB when he throws the deep ball Although Eddie Georges reemergence may quiet that a bit Dyson and Mason both saw an equal number of passes and both scored This week theyll face a Bengal defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Tony Banks put up a whopping yards passing last week But part of it was the big lead Washington was able to post Westbrook left with an ankle injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown This week theyll face a Cardinal defense thats been pretty good lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Atlanta Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok The team is clearly looking at Hes a dice roll if he starts but its not like Chandler was consistent Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but its tough to count on this team The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense For the nd week in a row Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up Tennessee for yards and TDs Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of choice again This week theyll face a Steeler defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with yards and a TD Sunday Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos in the league Theyll face a Bear defense this week ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks Clearly the stats dont quite back up their rep lately For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyve been stingy allowing FF points Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isnt that day Really puts the Cris Carter Randy Moss owners in a bind Normally they re sure starts but now Im not so certain He really looked bad at times Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I still think youll have to look hard there Plus its on Monday night so even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in theyll probably put forth a good effort The Ravens rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Kerry Collins went over yards last week and that was something Tiki Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing pretty much equal attention The Packers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with TDs and Interceptions Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all about Curtis Martin Especially with the Oakland Corners The Raiders rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Rich Gannon had an excellent day with yards and TDs although he did have the Interceptions Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball The Jets are in a must win situation and rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyve been tough Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week and better things seemed to happen He threw for TDs and nearly yards James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back onto the scene Theyll face a Buc defense this week ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think He had yards passing on attempts for an amazing yards per attempt Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but thats pathetic This week theyll face an Eagle defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense Start David Boston You already know that Id say Plummer merits consideration in lots of leagues too Boston again went nuts last week The Redskins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even with this tough matchup Boston is a sure starter unless youre comically loaded at WR Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense Van Pelt threw for under yards but the Bills did get the win It looks to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now Eric Moulds and Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things The Dolphins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start Sounds funny but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday He threw the ball all over the field Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger were especially involved The Cowboys rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks so itll be tough For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email

NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom will be posted soon for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best

be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Baltimores Moe Williams vs Indianapolis Defense With Jason Brookins unfortunate injury Moe Williams is handed the chance of a lifetime A month ago he was stuck behind Terry Allen and Brookins Now hes likely the guy wholl be asked to carry the rushing load for the defending World Champs Id expect youll see FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo to play a larger role Williams had already started becoming a much bigger part of the passing game catching passes for yards last week He also had carries for yards ypc I think hell do fine The Colts are reeling Their defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs You saw how Garrison Heart ran wild on them last week Green Bays Ahman Green vs Jacksonville Defense Start Ahman Green He rolled for yards on carries last week and looks as solid as ever Jacksoville is ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks as if you needed another reason to start him New Orleans Ricky Williams vs Carolina Defense Ricky Williams struggled a bit last week but still finished with yards on carries ypc and a TD He also added yards on receptions Hes simply too good to sit The Panthers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Start Williams Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Minnesota Defense Bettis faced a tough Titan team last week and still rumbled for yards on carries ypc Kordell Stewart is somewhat of a worry vulturing TDs but Bettis will get his share The Steelers losing OL Marvel Smith for any amount of time with a knee injury could be a problem On the plus side the Steelers are for real and they know Bettis is their key This week theyll face a much softer Viking Defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense LaDainian Tomlinson was the intended target of an amazing passes last week Even more impressive is that he caught all passes and netted yards receiving Paired with yards rushing on carries ypc he had a very quiet yards of offense On the downside he did fumble and he failed to get into the endzone His involvement in the offense though is great to see Hell face a Seattle defense this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Theyll also be without suspended CB Shawn Springs The Seahawks yielded yards rushing last week against Kansas City San Franciscos Garrison Hearst vs Buffalo Defense Garrison Hearst literally seemed to have turned back the clock last week Sunday was the first time Ive been able to say that truly looks like the old Hearst His burst and his cutbacks were exceptional Throw in the fact that Kevan Barlow injured his shoulder and Im liking him even more Keep an eye on Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley to see what role the ers give them with Barlow out I wouldnt be surprised to see them get some additional short yardage goalline chances Theyll face the Bills defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense You cant bench Marshall Faulk Especially against Atlantas defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Enough said Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Oakland Defense Michael Pittman clocked in last week with another of his middle of the road performances yards on carries ypc but he did get the TD score I wish hed be more productive in the passing game as QB Jake Plummer needs another option besides David Boston This week he faces an Oakland defense ranked a surprising in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks I caught some grief last week from people who disagreed with me suggesting Tiki Barber could have a good game against Oakland We know how that turned out The Raiders are a very good great team But people run the ball on them Theyre a little tougher in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank Carolinas Richard Huntley vs New Orleans Defense Richard Huntley came up small again last week with several stuffs at the goalline He had carries for yards ypc in an ugly game Huntleys saving grace may be that Brad Hoover or any of the other Panther RBs arent any better This week hell face a Saints defense that is pretty soft lately ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Still its hard to get too excited about a Panther at this point Chicagos Anthony Thomas James Allen vs Detroit Defense James Allen got the start for the ailing Anthony Thomas and delivered Allen rambled for yards on carries ypc It may have been the fast track in Minnesota but Allen looked much quicker than I ever remember seeing him This creates a huge headache for Allen Thomas owners Coach Dick Jauron would never say it but the Bears obviously have a great chance to go deep into the playoffs They know they need a healthy Anthony Thomas I would think youd see Jauron very cautious about using Thomas against a weak Detroit team Yes anything can happen just ask the Packers but I would think youll see the Bears lean on Allen one more week This is pure speculation on my part as its still very early in the week Stay tuned Detroit ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Englands Antowain Smith vs New York Jets Defense Antowain Smith continues to amaze He rolled up yards on carries ypc last week with a TD His longest run was yards so its not like he padded those numbers with one huge play The Jets rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks as theyve improved greatly from early on They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Oaklands Charlie Garner Zack Crockett vs Arizona Defense Garner looked like his typical self Sunday slashing for yards on carries ypc He also caught passes for yards including a TD His trouble is that he often has to watch Zack Crockett score the short TD from the sidelines Hard to believe Coach Jon Gruden could be that insensitive to you Garner owners but thats how it is The Cardinals rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but for the year rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Garner is too explosive to sit for most teams Tennessees Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense For some reason the Titans feel the need to throw on every down Eddie George only had carries last week He did gain yards ypc but he needs more work The Browns are rejuvenated but theyve been run on lately as they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Dallas Defense Davis left the game last week with back spasms long enough for KiJana Carter to steal what should have been Davis TD Ouch Hed been on fire before leaving Davis returned to the game and looks to be ok for this week Dallas has been sliding down the defense ranking and now comes in at in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they still rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Buffalos Travis Henry vs San Francisco Defense Just when we were ready to write Travis Henry off he produces like wed been expecting him to do all along Against a very good Miami Defense Henry rolled for yards on carries ypc and a TD New QB Alex Van Pelt is clearly softening the defense as they now must respect the passing game San Francisco is nothing special on defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs They allowed yards to the Colts last week Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Philadelphia Defense Both Holmes and Richardson are valuable Fantasy players Richardson is a real live featured RB with yards on carries ypc He threw in another yards on receptions to boot Richardson doesnt get the yardage but he has a nose for endzone He rushed times for yards ypc Sunday and scored again The Eagle defense looked very vulnerable against the Redskin rushing game last week They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Jets Curtis Martin vs New England Defense Curtis Martins ready to roll after a bye week as the Jets face an unexpectedly tough matchup with New England The Patriots rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Philadelphias Duce Staley vs Kansas City Defense Staley seems to be running hard but his Eagles are in a funk He rushed times for yards ypc and caught passes for yards Sunday This Eagle team is sliding while Kansas City is getting stronger The Chiefs rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year though they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to think Staley might be able to do something Seattles Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense Shaun Alexander had us worried last week as he struggled on the ground with yards on carries ypc He made up for it on the receptions where he caught balls for yards and a score Hes looking more like Ricky Watters Plus with each game The Chargers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank a very solid in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Last week they did a good job against Arizona holding them to rushing yards Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Cincinnati Defense Both of these guys turned in nice days against St Louis Monday Dunn rushed times for yards ypc and a score Alstott carried the ball times for yards ypc and scores Both were factors in the passing game as well Id look for something similar against the Bengals this week Cincinnati is falling back to reality and rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Alstott is obviously more attractive in TD only leagues but I can see going with either of these players here Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Atlantas Maurice Smith Bob Christian vs St Louis Defense Maurice Smith injured his ankle last week and turned the reins over to Bob Christian And Christian responded in a huge way Dan Reeves is winning with smoke and mirrors here but I wouldnt be surprised to see Christian remain a big part of this offense even if Smith can go As you saw Monday night with Mike Alstott the Rams are certainly vulnerable to a big powerful RB and Christian fills that bill St Louis ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Rams are beat up though and Christian might be worth a shot if youre ready to roll the dice Just understand the risk though that he could go back to his old role if Smith is healthy Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Tampa Bay Defense Weve said all along that this could be a very good team if they could just get adequate play from the QBs Evidently thats too much to ask With the passing game quickly fading Dillon is having a very tough time finding any room to run Dillon managed yards on carries ypc last week against a good Cleveland team The going wont be any easier this week against Tampa Bay that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs You never know which Dillon will show and its tough to figure out which Buccaneer team will be there That makes this a tough call all the way around Clevelands James Jackson Ben Gay vs Tennessee Defense James Jackson tweaked his foot again so watch to see how this shakes out Ben Gay did see action Sunday Jackson was a non factor with yards on carries ypc Fortunately for him Gay was even worse with yards on carries ypc This week theyll both face a tough Titan team thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the season theyre ranked in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Denvers Mike Anderson Terrell Davis vs Miami Defense Mike Anderson answered the critics well with a carry day for yards ypc Sunday He also scored a TD With Olandis Gary out for the season its now down to Anderson and Terrell Davis Watch this one very closely as Davis is reportedly making good progress and could play this week If hes ready to go I think youll see Mike Shanahan give him plenty of carries Some are even saying he might start I personally think itll be Anderson starting with Davis seeing a fair amount of action Keep an eye on this through the week Miami ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs but they were exposed by Buffalos Travis Henry last week Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs Baltimore Defense I love to see a no name like Dominic Rhodes come in and succeed He was extremely active last week and is doing a great job of filling in for Edgerrin James He rushed times for yards ypc and TDs He also had receptions for yards Hell face a tough defense this week in Baltimore though The Ravens rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even so unless you have very solid options Id take a hard look at keeping Rhodes in your lineup Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Green Bay Defense Stacey Mack isnt making anyone forget about Fred Taylor but Mack owners had to like his TDs last week He put up yards on carries ypc Taylors status is still up in the air so Id think youll probably see Mack again The Packers bring a tough defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so its going to be rough going for him Although it wont be as tough as it was last week against the Ravens On a side note I keep hearing whispers that Taylor could be done for the season Nothing official from the Jaguars though You truly never know with Fred Taylor I could see him missing the rest of the games and I could also see him stepping in for week and lighting up the scoreboard Miamis Lamar Smith Travis Minor vs Denver Defense Once again Lamar Smith looked tentative and slow He only gained yards on carries ypc although he did score Travis Minor on the other hand looked explosive and gained yards on carries ypc The fact that Miami won the game probably keeps Smith in the slot but you have to wonder how Minor would do with a bigger role Miamis had to shuffle the Offensive Line due to injuries something it did not have to do last season Denver is ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so this wont be a cakewalk They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Dallas Emmitt Smith Troy Hambrick vs Washington Defense Its sad to see but Emmitt Smith is probably not the best RB on the roster anymore Especially not from a Fantasy Football angle Troy Hambrick merely put up yards on carries ypc Sunday but he did score twice Smith on the other hand managed just yards on carries you do your own ypc here Clearly there are ill feelings between Smith and management as hes publicly questioning their desire to win as they evaluate talent for next year Im sure hes a little more sensitive as the primary talent they seem to be evaluating is the guy wholl take his job This week the Cowboys face a rejuvenated Redskin team and a tough defense They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Detroits James Stewart vs Chicago Defense James Stewart roared back with a vengeance last Thursday rolling up yards on carries ypc He looked strong and quick Corey Schlesinger was still in the picture with rushes for yards ypc and receptions for yards Both should have trouble though this week against an excellent Bears team ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Pittsburgh Defense Bennett is slowly climbing his way out of the Super Bust spotlight Helps to have Randy Moss on the field at the same time to deflect some attention He rushed times for yards ypc and definitely showed flashes Hes a threat anytime he touches the ball He also caught a pass This week he faces a very tough defense with Pittsburgh though The Steelers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to view this as a tough matchup Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to follow Joe Bryant Analytics Inc

NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom posted soon for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Green Bay Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Start Brett Favre Its that simple Antonio Freeman continues to look good and deserves a start in most leagues Bill Schroeder was pretty quiet last week but dont look for that to last Jacksonville ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and this should be a nice matchup for Favre and Company Oakland Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Rich Gannon continues to prove hes one of the better QBs in Football With yards and TDs Sunday he looked totally in control of his offense Of course it helps when Tim Brown and Jerry Rice are on the receiving end of your throws Both those guys look as good as ever Arizona ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so this is clearly a mismatch San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense That Flutie Magic was fading a little but he looked strong last week with yards and TDs TE Freddie Jones and WR Tim Dwight could make it back this week to pair with Jeff Graham and Curtis Conway The Chargers are getting stronger while the Seahawks were dealt a serious blow Tuesday with CB Shawn Springs suspended for games due to failing a steroid test This should really open the passing offense LaDainian Tomlinson was a huge factor as well Sunday in the passing game with receptions The Seahawks rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Alex Van Pelt continues to justify my Rob Johnson bashing There is no way Van Pelt should see the bench once Johnson is healthy In the squeaky wheel gets the grease department Eric Moulds complained pretty loudly last week he wasnt seeing enough passes thrown his way Van Pelt obliged and Moulds delivered in a big way including an incredible one handed circus catch FB Larry Centers is seeing tons of passes as well San Francisco is ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but their secondary seems to be improving For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Jim Millers yard performance Sunday against the Viking defense probably didnt carry many teams to victory This Bear team is looking more and more like the Ravens to me with an adequate QB powerful rushing and great defense If Miller is your guy you may have to accept these up and down games Marty Booker was a non factor after his great week performance Dez White saw twice as many passes thrown his way than did Booker Detroit ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so thats a positive Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Tim Couch put up another Couchlike game with yards and TD The ultra reliable Kevin Johnson caught another TD and looks to be an every week starter Quincy Morgan did see more work than usual but KJ is still the primary guy by a good bit The Titans rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so this might be a good spot for him Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Even with Mike McMahon providing th Quarter excitement Charlie Batch is still the starter For how long is anyones guess and youd have to think theres even a danger that he could be pulled for McMahon if Batch falters Good luck if you can figure out anything the Lion management comes up with Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice and hes pretty much it Cory Schlesinger is still seeing plenty of passes thrown his way if youre really ready to reach The Bears rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they did shut down the Vikings passing attack last week Jacksonville Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Mark Brunell is still hampered by the Quad injury and is no lock to play this week If he cant go WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell will be downgraded Much has been made of the Jimmy Smith troubles Assuming Brunell can play I wouldnt be surprised to see Smith blow up with a monster game Just a hunch Green Bay isnt anything special on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They are tougher for the year ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs New York Jets Passing Game vs New England Defense Vinny Testeverde should be rested but you have to wonder how hell fare against Bill Belichick and New England Wayne Chrebet and Laveranues Coles will be aided by the speedy play of Santana Moss Moss is almost a whole year behind the other rookies though so dont look for too much from him New England ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks although Belichick has been known to have a few wrinkles up his sleeve For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Hasselbeck didnt throw any interceptions Sunday But he only threw for yards That wont get it done in Holmgrens offense Darrell Jackson and Koren Robinson were pretty active but it was RB Shaun Alexander who carried the receiving load Id look for that to continue as Seattle sticks with the conservative game plan The Chargers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so its not like theyre dominating people Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimore Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Elvis Grbac fought back nicely last week with yards and TD Interception The TD was huge as he rallied the team from behind Im not a Shannon Sharpe fan but you have to give the guy his due he moaned and pointed fingers last week but when the game was on the line he delivered Travis Taylor and Qadry Ismail are decent plays but inconsistent Indy has struggled lately They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Carolina Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Chris Weinke finally scored a TD So what if it was rushing the ball The Panthers continued to look bad last week Weinke threw for yards TDs and Interceptions Wesley Walls was a non factor which is hard to understand WR Muhsin Muhammad missed last weeks game and his return for this week is still in limbo The Saints rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so the matchup isnt awful I just have very little faith in the Panthers right now Indianapolis Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Peyton Manning is clearly pressing as he tries to carry the load of this team He threw Interceptions last week and three looked to be his fault On the flip side he did throw for yards with a TD so it wasnt all bad This Colt team looks like it could be playing catchup from here on out so you have to like Mannings chances Hes battled the trouble with Interceptions this season and I wouldnt be too worried Marvin Harrison and Terrence Wilkins were the primary targets After a couple of excellent games TE Marcus Pollard now is catching fewer balls than Ken Dilger The Ravens rank in Passing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Miami Passing Game vs Denver Defense Jay Fiedlers up and down season continued last week as he threw for yards and TDs leading the Dolphins back to victory Weve been hyping rookie WR Chris Chambers since June and he delivered in a big way with big TDs As we head into week its pretty clear that many of these rookies arent really rookies anymore Oronde Gadsden was extremely active as well with yards Theyll face Denver this week that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs New Orleans Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Aaron Brooks continues to look solid He threw for yards last week with a TD plus he ran for yards Joe Horn and Willie Jackson gather most of the passes while TE Boo Williams is not a bad choice if you need a TE as hes seeing lots of balls thrown his way Carolina ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Although they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Kordell Stewart with yards and passing TDs against the Titans Believe it Plus another TD rushing Hes looking good and has the one thing he desperately needed confidence Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both looked strong although Ward is the only one I really trust there The OL is banged up but still I like Stewarts chances Minnesota ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs St Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Yes Kurt Warner looked human Monday night Even with his bad game he threw for yards and a TD Hell be fine as will all the Rams Torry Holt was huge and Isaac Bruce was a big part of the offense Atlanta ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but Id be hard pressed to have any of the Rams key players on my bench Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Steve McNair with pass attempts for yards and TDs Plus another rushing TD Thats how whacked this season is He looked pretty good doing it too WRs Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson with TE Frank Wycheck handle the receiving All are decent options assuming McNair keeps going to the air so often Cleveland ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks However for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Jake Plummer put up decent numbers last week with yards TD and Interceptions With Frank Sanders nursing bad hamstrings its evident that WR David Boston is the focus And hes been unstoppable He had receptions for yards and a TD last week The Raiders are ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so this wont be easy For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Denver Passing Game vs Miami Defense With Rod Smith hobbled on both ankles now Brian Griese is looking very ordinary He had yards and TD last week Smith has injured his other ankle He clearly was limited last week even though he played through it TEs Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell are probably his next best targets Miami hopes to have cornerback Sam Madison back this week which would be a huge boost The Dolphins are ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year theyre ranked in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Kansas City Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Trent Green didnt throw a TD but he did rack up yards and looked as good as he has all season TE Tony Gonzalez was active as always but most importantly WR Derrick Alexander seemed to be healthy Thats huge This week they face a Philadelphia team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs They have sacks over the last games so they clearly can pressure the passer Itll be a great test for Green Minnesota Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Chicago has one of the weakest pass defenses in the league yet they shut down the Viking passing game last week You figure it out Culpepper Moss and Carter are all too valuable to sit as they could go off at any time But they certainly are frustrating My friend and local Vikings Expert Bill Davies has a theory that Moss was serving a secret one game suspension during the Bears game On a positive note TE Byron Chamberlain looked to be very much involved in the offense again This week its a tough matchup with Pittsburgh that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks The Steelers are against the run so you have to think the Vikings will be throwing Philadelphia Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Donovan McNabb looked awful again throwing for only yards It seems to me hes trying to prove his ability to stay in the pocket at any cost Hes much better when hes mobile James Thrash and Todd Pinkston both struggled with McNabb TE Chad Lewis had several passes thrown his way but couldnt catch any of them Kansas City is improving on Defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs San Francisco Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jeff Garcia is a must start in any league Same with Terrell Owens Owens has a bad foot and ankle but the early word is that hell play and be ok JJ Stokes continues to improve He scored a TD Sunday And TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in the offense and deserves consideration in TE leagues Buffalo is solid against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it wont be a cakewalk Still though Garcia and Owens are no brainers Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Brad Johnson continues to throw more times for fewer yards than anyone I can remember He had passes for yards Monday night As always Keyshawn Johnson was the WR of choice RBs Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott each saw receptions as well The Bengals are surprisingly tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Could this be the week Keyshawn Johnson snares that ever elusive first TD of the year Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Atlanta Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Chris Chandler refused to play along last week throwing for just yards and TDs against a soft Carolina defense I think he does it just to spite me FB Bob Christian was the leading receiver But theyre winning Tony Martin and Shawn Jefferson have to be considered risky This week Atlanta faces a much tougher St Louis defense so that probably means Chandler will do well The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Overall I wouldnt put much faith in this Falcon passing game Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Avoid these guys Scott Mitchell or Jon Kitna or Akili Smith I think Ill take Boomer Esiason out of the pressbox Peter Warrick injured his shoulder so keep an eye on him No Bengal caught more than passes Sunday which means theyre all pretty worthless at this point Tampa Bay ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks for what its worth Dallas Passing Game vs Washington Defense The Ryan Leaf era is over Hope you made video tapes Quincy Carter is set to get the start and I have zero faith in him That means Joey Galloway and Rocket Ismail should struggle as well With Emmitt Smith crying to the press this team is in danger of total implosion Oh yeah Washington ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks New England Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Coach Bill Belichick is looking awfully smart starting Tom Brady over Drew Bledsoe as Brady threw for TDs Sunday Clearly the guy is for real Troy Brown is by far his favorite target and the only guy consistent enough to merit serious consideration in most leagues The Jets are tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it should be interesting Very tough matchup but Brady has shown me though that hes a guy youd do well not to underestimate If youve been riding him Id look real hard at keeping him in the lineup Washington Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Tony Banks wont remind anyone of Joe Montana but he seems to do just enough to win He only threw for yards Sunday but he made few mistakes Rod Gardner and Michael Westbrook continued to play solid football Dallas ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it doesnt look like a positive matchup Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To

<24621313.1075863519662.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-26 17:23:47,Footballguys Update Week Upgrade DowngradeHi Folks Once again our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this weeks Upgrades and Downgrades Enjoy Joe Upgrades QB Tom Brady Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the return of Drew Bledsoe from injury Some analysts may question the fact that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury but no one can question Bradys effectiveness on the football field A yard touchdown performance keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter Keep in mind the Patriots have a bye in week QB Kordell Stewart Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second consecutive multiple touchdown game Stewart finished the game with passing yards rushing yards and total touchdowns The schedule looks good for Stewart down the stretch especially with games against Detroit and Cincinnati in weeks and QB Jay Fiedler Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris Chambers Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season but his upside is good A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats QB Alex Van Pelt Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson Van Pelt has been a fantasy star With two consecutive yards games to match with touchdowns Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents Look for another quality performance against the ers this weekend RB Dominic Rhodes With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season Rhodes has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense He produced on Sunday with total yards and touchdowns Two consecutive difficult games against Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down but a strong finish to the season is in store With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions look for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes RB Antowain Smith Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with total yards and touchdowns However now is the time to trade Smith away His value has hit an alltime high and the remainder of the season will be difficult with Cleveland Miami and a bye week remaining RB Ahman Green Green has struggled the last few weeks but was able to bust out on Thanksgiving Day with total yards and scores Look for the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the season As the winter weather approaches Favre and the passing game will become more conservative which will result in more dump off passes to the talented Green Dont be surprised if Green receives touchesgame the remainder of the season RB LaDainian Tomlinson Tomlinsons statistics have suffered over the last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run In order to get the ball in Tomlinsons hands more often Turner called several short passing plays to get LT in the open field The plan was successful as Tomlinson caught passes for yards The fantasy playoffs look good for Tomlinson with Oakland Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks and RB Garrison Hearst Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with rushing yards and touchdowns In the last games Hearst has averaged rushing yardsgame With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on Sunday to go along with an already injured quad Hearst will continue to see touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs as long as he remains healthy WR Derrick Alexander Good news for Alexander ownersit appears that he is healthy for the first time this season WR Eric Moulds Throughout the week Moulds was complaining about the lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him Well the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball What happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds He produced yards and touchdowns WR Chris Chambers The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with receiving yards and fabulous touchdowns Chambers is the big play threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action Keep in mind Chambers is a boombust option at receiver Hell dazzle you one week and disappear the next week This guy is going to be special so grab him in dynasty leagues WR David Boston Plain and simplethe man A few weeks ago the knock on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring Well touchdowns in weeks should quiet the critics WR Kevin Johnson Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday with yards and a touchdown Johnson is Tim Couchs clear cut receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the season WR Troy Brown Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent basis With catches for yards and a touchdown on Sunday Brown continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady Keep in mind New England has a bye in week so Brown will not be available for the majority of championship games Plan accordingly Downgrades QB Trent Green Greens disappointing season continues He looked good with passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday However he was unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade With the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver Greens stock could be on the rise in the near future Greens value is at its lowest point so you could probably get him for relatively cheap Hes not an every week starter but he might have a few big games left for this season QB Donovan McNabb McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the last two weeks passing yards and touchdown His pride of wanting to be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production McNabbs value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some plays Right now McNabb should still be considered a top fantasy quarterback However if his lack of production continues his stock will drop quickly QB Brian Griese Grieses receiving options are limited which is directly affecting his production Rod Smith limped through Thursdays game with an ankle injury A healthy return of Smith will boost Grieses stock However Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver position His production is limited if he is forced to throw to the tight end position the majority of the time QB Daunte Culpepper Culpepper did not passscore a touchdown for the first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week RB Anthony Thomas Thomas was held out of Sundays game with a hamstring injury Hes expecting to play this weekend against Detroit but this is not a guarantee With James Allen being effective it would not surprise me to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs A big game looms in two weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that game RB Emmitt Smith Smith was held to yards on carries during the Thanksgiving Day game Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game Smiths numbers will remain meager RB Ron Dayne With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option in the rushing game Daynes fantasy value has dropped very low Dayne had yards on carries Barber had rushing yards on carries receptions for yards and a touchdown Keep Dayne on your bench RB Jason Brookins Brookins broke his foot in Sundays game against the Jaguars He is expected to be out for weeks Drop him and add someone else to the roster RB Eddie George Georges disappointing season continues with yards on carries this past Sunday George is currently tied with Randy Moss for Fantasy Disappointment of the Year RB Maurice Smith Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to return to the game However Smith gained a meager yards on carries and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain Evaluate his progress later this week WR Jimmy Smith Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after being pulled over by police No legal action will occur but some sort of suspension could be handed down by the commissioners office Not a good sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs WR Peter Warrick Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland on Sunday He was held to reception for yards and has not scored a touchdown since week of the season Keep him on your bench until the Cincinnati passing game reappears WR Randy Moss Moss was held to yards on catches Sunday night Moss is the most talented receiver in the league but appears to lose concentration from time to time Keep in mind his potential for explosive games is enormous Waiver Wire Keep in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and team leagues QB Alex Van Pelt Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson Van Pelt has been a fantasy star With two consecutive yards games to match with touchdowns Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents RB James Allen Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and performed admirably With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury its highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this weekend Chicagos defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on the ground RB Travis Minor With Lamar Smith averaging just ydscarry over the last games Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon In his limited touches Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a much needed spark WR Chris Chambers This guy is good See description in upgrades section TE Eddie Boo Williams I had Williams on the list last week and his play on Sunday deserves another mention Although he had just catches for yards Williams has explosive potential He nearly scored on a yard pass play but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury Williams is a tight end with quality upside Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo

Players As we head down the home stretch identifying those players movi ng up or down can be the difference betweendominating the playoffs or watchi ng from the sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these player s its inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or downg rade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players th at are moving In other words a player like TE Ricky Dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Like wise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he s still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Aaron Brooks NO We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up yards and TDs as h e went for The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it appea rs Brooks will continue to air the ball out Yes hell make some young QB mistakes and Id be surprised if he didnt throw as many interceptions as he does TDs I expect him to throw a lot of both I almost started him over Peyton Manning in my local league but didnt pull the trigger Manning wa s solid but Brooks was better QB Kordell Stewart Pit Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here he sits again It took a few years but hes showing folks that maybe was no fluke He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked out with a bad knee or calf depending on whether you listen to coach Bill Cowher or Stewart The TD rush was highlight material His problem all along seems to have been confidence and hes surely brimming with it now Kent Graham was so bad I wont even mention him in the downgrades but he p ut on a horrid display when he was in the game Hes awful QB Jay Fiedler Mia Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks ago that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler was as pretty as anything Dan Marino ever threw Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair ly often against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going to have an advantage in their cold weather Didnt play out that way Fiedler looks pretty darn good QB Jeff Garcia SF We had him high in week like we have all year and he didnt disappoint WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently Jerry Rices wifeharping on the radio had some sort of positive effect The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded them QB Brett Favre GB I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu y just does what it takes to get the job done Hed be much better off if W R Antonio Freeman earned of his paycheck but in the meantime Bill Schroeders doing a great job QB Jeff George Was Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to keeping his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday George looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year Although tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch Im a Jeff George fan though and he does give the team a big arm Well see how it goes but at least it looks as if hell get his shot RBs Moving Up RB Mike Anderson Den Like you need me to tell you this The fact that he ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the more impressive He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to be good for Sunday Clearly the Denver OL is the star on this team so if you own Anderson its probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t he stretch run RB Fred Taylor Jac For all the earlyripping Ive done to Taylor hes performed just as we predicted he would lately like a madman You dont need me to tell you hes been awesome RB Warrick Dunn TB Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike Alstott Ive got a couple hundred reasons that says yes Ok rushing for against Dallas is nothing special its happened in of the Cowboys games this year but you have to admit Dunn looked great Sunday RB Corey Dillon Cin One can only salivate about what he might do if he played for a team like Denver The fact he can continue to roll up huge yardage on this team is amazing New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as he looks like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili Smith RB Ahman Green GB Greens a guy thats finally living up to his potential You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to be catching up mentally as well He showed a nice nose for the endzone Sunday with the TDs RB Lamar Smith Mia So much for the cold weather hamstring worries Smith carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great It look s to me like hes picking up right where he left off RB Terrell Fletcher SD Its not exactly the same as earning the startin g RB job in Tennessee or Indianapolis but Fletcher does seem to have nailed down the RB slot in San Diego And thats worth something You have t o decide how much RB Fred Beasley SF We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up TDs He got back in the mix Sunday with carries and a TD The FB for S an Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth th e roll of the dice if youre thin at RB RB Shawn Bryson Buf Finally Bryson does something besides make me look bad for hyping him He rolled up yards on just attempts Sunday and looks to take advantage of Sammy Morris ankle troubles RB Terry Allen NO Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore and Chad Morton failing to astound anyone Allen could get more looks Whether hes got anything left in the tank remains to be seen WRs Moving Up WR David Boston Ari Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be considered an upgrade Hes a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total non factor Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummers attention these days And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind he could do some damage WR Darrell Jackson Sea Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had cooled of late He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center Its tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort h a shot WR Curtis Conway SD Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf resurgence He caught passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues to improve WR Willie Jackson NO Jacksons officially moved past the flash in the pan stage with another solid day Aaron Brooks continues to look good at QB Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no w hes looking good WR Joe Horn NO Again QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime recipient Joe Horn is one of the better stories of and he should continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesnt get untracked WR Bobby Shaw Pit Shaw may still be available in your league as the starting WR opposite Hines Ward He found the endzone again and continues to make some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking WR Terrell Owens SF The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a solid day from Terrell Owens Hes a huge boost to the offense when he ca n go and it looked like hed made progress with the toe Keep an eye out fo r how he responds after the game but I liked what I saw WR Shockmain Davis NE Ok Ill be honest Im pretty much just includi ng him here because hes the owner of the coolest name in the league TEs Moving Up TE Dwayne Carswell Den Carswells finally starting to emerge as the TE of choice in Denver His yards Sunday were second only to San Diegos Freddie Jones You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I d have no trouble starting Carswell each week TE Reggie Kelly Atl One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th e play of Kelly He caught passes for yards Sunday with a TD New QB Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in TE Mark Bruener Pit Bruener makes the list not only for having another solid game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a s he piggy backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t he yard line TE Andrew Glover NO Obviously the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve l of play for all the Saints receivers Glover made a couple of nice plays Sunday including a good looking TD catch Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Shane Matthews Chi Take a seat Shane Cade McNown likely makes his return Folks can hardly wait QB Troy Aikman Dal Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem strange to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro m a huge deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt Clearly the team has zero faith in Aikmans ability to throw the ball QB Shaun King TB I know hes had trouble with the back but passing yards Thats a joke Hell be better but Ive seen enough QB Brad Johnson Was Its the Jeff George show At least untilGeorge looks bad for a few series QB Rob Johnson Buf In leagues that penalize for interceptions youd ha ve been better off starting yourself this weekend than you wouldve Rob Johnson Once again he starts the game but finishes holding a clipboard RBsMoving Down RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons not playing too badly but the team is in shambles After QB Chris Chandler was benched Anderson vented some frustrations saying for all he knew he might be punting this week I dont think well see that but I also dont think well see the days of him seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year RB Shaun Alexander Sea RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an ideal playmate refusing to share the ball Actually hes played so well that Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o f his star When the team is struggling as badly as it is you dont mess with the one thing thats working Philadelphia RBs Forget about them This team will live and die by Donovan McNabb RB Jermaine Fazande SD Evidently Fazande is the nd choice behind Terrell Fletcher now Thats gotta hurt WRs Moving Down WR Joe Jurevicius NYG This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu s as hes been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto r when he returns Hes no lock to go this week but he may be close WR Terrance Mathis Atl Mathis continues to struggle on a team thats in a tailspin New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso n which could spell more bad things for Mathis WRs Torrance Small Charles Johnson Phi Forget about it Donovan McNa bb can be a solid QB without WRs WRs James McKnight Wayne McGarity Dal These guys just arent very McGood QB Troy Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self WR Marcus Robinson Chi Robinsons back troubles were apparently more serious than many had expected It was announced Monday that hell likely miss the rest of the season with a bulging disk in his back It appears h e can get by without surgery but hes certainly not looking good TEs Moving Down TEs Marcus Pollard Ken Dilger Ind Neither of these guys did much Sunday This offense clearly isnt in the same groove it was earlier this year TEs Jackie Harris David LaFleur Dal More bad news associated with Tro y Aikman Neither of these guys were much value Sunday and I dont see that changing very quickly TE Pete Mitchell NYG One of the bigger disappointments at TE this seaso n he just cant get untracked To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

buddy Bob Harris from the TFL Report For more info on subscribing check out flashupdatecfm Enjoy Joe BLEDSOE NOW APPEARS READY TO START VS CHIEFS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to reports out of Foxboro New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe took his regular turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid ay and all indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as usual against the Chiefs Monday night Of course that hardly means Bledsoe is percent healthy hes anything but And whether its jammed bruised sprained fractured broken or just plain old sore the real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th e thumb on his throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability to throw the ball Not surprisingly head coach Bill Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off than hes been the previous three weeks This is the th week of the season There will be a lot of players out there on both teams who will be less than percent and Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac is one of them said Belichick Same thing wit h our quarterback Thats football in the th week of the season Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in Detroit on Thanksgiving day but regressed as the game progressed throwing two crucial fourthquarter interceptions that kept the team from mounting a realistic comeback And even though Bledsoe continues to insist the thumb isnt affecting his throws youd be hardpressed to find any evidence backing that contention The bottom line here says a lack quality depth at the key offensive skill positions around him make it very difficult to rely on Bledsoe for consistent production Other items of interest Michael Felger of the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with the weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at lessthanfull speed coaches would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs The question is whethe r injuryprone JR Redmond will be up to the task If not look for Belichi ck to spread the load between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass Reserve tight end Chris Eitzmann ribs was placed on injured reserve for the season leaving the Pats with one roster spot to fill Starting wid e out Troy Brown leg was the only player not to fully participate at practice and his availability is likely to be determined by a dreaded game day decision MITCHELL REMAINS ON TRACK TO RETURN AS BENGALS STARTER IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals head coach Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as probable to star t at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals tomorrow Mitchell missed last weeks game against Pittsburgh because of a sprained left knee This week his mobility was better as he took percent of the practice snaps and Akili Smith took percent I think probables a good word LeBeau said Were gonna see h ow Scotts knee responds but he looks better every day Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Fridays practice I dont see any reason why I shouldnt be able to go he said LeBeau said Mitchell probably wont need a Sunday morning test as he did last week before the Pittsburgh game I dont think that will be necessary unless some complications develo p between todays workout and Sunday LeBeau said According to those who follow the team closely the Bengals would like to use the teams remaining games to evaluate Mitchell before attempting to resign to the veteran signal caller to compete with thirdyear mantobe Smith for the starting QB job next season Team president Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his first practice in days Thursday Other items of interest Browns continuous and vehement denials havent stopped the speculation regarding his future role with the team SportsLinecom jumped on the bandwagon this week when the reported that the man I like to call the Neanderthal GM is thinking seriously about reducing his own role and bringing in a football man along the lines of former Steeler director o f football operations and current ESPN NFL maven Tom Donahoe to handle the daytoday front office duties Browns response to another report stating that a handful of close friend had advised him to step down and let somebody else handle the teams football operations was classic I dont have five friends he stated flatly And finally Rookie wide out Peter Warrick said his skipping a teammandated eye appointment last Tuesday was an oversight But if he ski ps another one it will cost him Team officials set up the checkup because they believe Warrick needs conta ct lenses Receivers coach Steve Mooshagian felt strongly enough about it to levy a fine if Warrick goes AWOL again GROH UPBEAT AS MARTIN CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ESPNs John Clayton reported last night that New York Jets halfback Curtis Martin took all of his regular snaps Friday and should be fine for Sunday s game against the Colts Martin still has a bruised gluteus maximus but hes in better shape than last week The fact that he opened the week listed a probable rather than starting out as questionable like last week has to be a good sign And if you asked me head coach Al Groh seemed to be quite a bit more upbe at this week at one point responding to a reporters request that he assess Martins current condition by saying Fine fine Thats about as indepth detailed and upbeat reply Ive heard him utter this season But seriously folks The soreness in Martins booty could linger but it wont keep the former Patriot out of the lineup And with Bernie Parmale e emerging as a legitimate threat in a relief role the Jets seem to be capable of getting the job done Also of interest this morning Rookie tight end Anthony Becht now has a neck injury to go along with the sore knee thats bothered him the last two weeks However the youngtster is expected to start and play as usual at this point Fellow rookie Laveranues Coles will miss his second straight game with a knee sprain and his absence has clearly left a void in the teams vertical passing game th e last two weeks On a more postive note Coles was able to get some light work in during practice late this week and could return at or near full speed sometime next week In the meantime Windrell Hayes will continue to come off the bench as the numberthree man until Coles return Former Steeler wide out Malcolm Johnson is becoming part of the Jets syste m as expected Groh said The newcomers biggest challenge is simply learnin g how the Jets operate Hes getting more comfortable with the plays and the words Groh said Every team has a different language and you have to adjust to that He seems to be a quick student he just needs to get through all the lessons And finally While the Jets obviouly have some kind of plan in mind for implementing Leon Johnson its too early to tell when he might be able to follow through on such a plan We saw some of the skills that made him a good player in the past Groh said of Johnsons first workout with the team on Wednesday But you also saw that he started training camp Wednesday After blowing out his left knee in the Jets season opener last year Johnson is eager to work his way back into the mix Some guys take two days to get ready in training camp Groh said Some guys take days or two weeks Thats where we are with Leon Im feeling good Johnson said Its just real good to be back out ther e Thats really all Im concerned with right now The Jets would love for him to return to form quickly so he can resume kickreturn duties soon and relieve Dedric Ward who has not been impressive BIAKABUTUKA OUT HOOVER TO START VS RAMS IMAGE Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Friday December PT IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE According to reports out of Carolina tonight the Panthers will hit the field this Sunday without Tim Biakabutuka who is struggling to overcome a painful turf toe injury for the third week in a row According to ESPN NFL insider John Clayton the Panthers deactivated the former firstround draft pick because they didnt want to ruin his chances of playing the fin al three weeks of the season Brad Hoover an undrafted rookie from Western Carolina will continue to line up as the starting halfback His yard oneTD performance in Monday nights win over the Packers added exponentially to the sudden celebrity status Hoover attained after h is first game as the starter This whole thing has just been crazy he said Ive never gotten this much attention before and Im still trying to figure out how to handle it Count St Louis signal caller Kurt Warner among Hoovers fans I always like that stuff its always good to see guys that were never given much of a chance to come in and really make a name and do well for themselves the former Arena League star noted Heck Biakabutuka even admitted to mixed emotions as he stood on the sidelines watching fans respond to Hoover in a way theyve never responded to him However the former University of Michigan star also realizes just how hard Hoover has worked in almost total obscurity prior to gettin g this break all of which made it hard not to be happy for his teammate But Biakabutuka also found himself just a little bit worried after teammat e Michael Bates told him the story of fella named Wally Pipp who played first base for the New York Yankees Or at least he did until the day this new kid named Lou Gehrig came along and filled in for him I dont want to be Wally Pipp Biakabutuka said earnestly Other items of interest Wide receiver

see thecheatsheet onlineweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just becau se one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is mea nt to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Jamal Anderson Atl vs Seahawk Defense If youve learned anything t his season its start RBs facing the Seahawk defense Fo the year they ra nk in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Over the last four week s theyve really tailed off ranking in rushing yards allowed per gam e Theyre playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a statement Warrick Dunn TB vs Cowboy Defense The Cowboys havent gotten any b etter against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For the year theyre ranked in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs Dunns athletic style will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner d id earlier the season Fred Taylor Jac vs Brown Defense Cleveland struggles against most any RB but especially tough physical rushing teams Taylor and the Jaguars fi t that bill This season has seen some rushing performances of historical significance this year You might see another one this week On paper i t s a dream matchup Tyrone Wheatley Oak vs Steeler Defense I know its hard to believe but the numbers show that over the past four weeks Pittsburgh ranks in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre allowing yards rushing on the ground Granted Fred Taylor Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into that number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isnt too far down below thei r class Hes healthier now than he has been in a while Ricky Watters Sea vs Falcon Defense Ive been a Ricky Watters fan since the er days One of the best combinations of rushing and receiving in some time Hes had an age defying season and the roll should continue against a Falcon unit thats been awful defending the run lately For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For th e year theyre in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Eve ryone keeps wondering when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets blown out here which I have hard time seeing I think youll see plent y of Ricky Watters Corey Dillon Cin vs Cardinal Defense Like Fred Taylor vs Cleveland this one looks almost too good to be true on paper They dont always t urn out that way in reality but youve got to be drooling over this game if you re a Dillon owner His running in the lack of a real passing game threat is an amazing feat Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be effective throwing the ball which will help even more Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Tony Richardson Kimble Anders KC vs Patriot Defense Our support o f Christian Okoye last week for a Chief RB didnt garner much support fro m the KC coaching staff so it looks like another week of Richardson Anders Anders actually got plenty of carries last week and promptly did very litt le with them Richardson appears to be the better back right now but who know s how this will play out Its hard for me to advocate either But if y ou do go with one know that theyll be facing a pretty soft New England rush defense that ranks in rushing yards allowed per gameover the last fo ur weeks Tshimanga Biakabutuka Brad Hoover Car vs Rams Defense Biakabutuka found there was no rehabilitation method quite as effective as folk s chanting Hoooooover on Monday night Amazing how that consis tently works Biakabutuka has been upgraded to probable but Im not convinced Hoover just takes his place back on the bench Youll likely see both go The Rams still give up a good bit of yardage on the ground lately averagin g yards per game over the last four weeks That ranks them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB JR Redmond NE vs Chief Defense The Patriots are a tough team to figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny But if he can hold them together Ive got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here Th e Chiefs rank over the past four weeks in rushing yards allowed per gam e For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing R B Keep an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he cant go all bets are off b ut if he can keep the defense honest I like Redmonds chances here Of cour se you have to know the risks that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong way Edgerrin James Ind vs Jets Defense The NFL is the ultimate game of watching to see what others do You can bet the Colts are aware of the success Chicagos James Allen had last week rushing and fumbling the ball against New York I think youll see a steady diet of Edgerrin doing t he same thing hopefully not fumbling though James is a no brainer star t him against virtually any team unless youre so loaded at RB its no t fair Eddie George Ten vs Eagle Defense Philadelphia isnt quite as tough vs the run as their reputation might have you believe Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB But you can pretty much throw those numbers out when its Eddie George Hell ge t his yards the hard way Id be very surprised if you dont see George e xhibit some leadership here and put together a solid effort Curtis Martin NYJ vs Colts Defense It sounds like Curtis Martin is ju st going to have to play with the strained buttocks youve heard enough jokes by now Ill spare you The Indy defense is definitely vulnerable to the rush For the season they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs This game will be in New York and the Colts are soft when it s cold outside so Martin could have an edge James Allen Chi vs Green Bay Lets give Allen the benefit of the d oubt and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced although I didnt see Curtis Martin fumble three times and he was there too If he can fin d the handle on the ball hell be fine as he actually ran very while when he managed to hang on to the football Green Bay proved Monday night they can t stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears and for Allen Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Travis Prentice Jamel White Cle vs Jaguar Defense This is one of those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper Jacksonville has yielded an average of yards rushing per game over the last four weeks That ranks them They also rank for the year i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs But theyre playing better than that now I believe And the Browns are just playing out the season And the bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel White has looked impressive Its a decent matchup for Cleveland but Id probably shy from these guys if it were me Michael Pittman Ari vs Bengal Defense A case of both sides being bette r than what many people think Michael Pittman is a player Since Vince Tobin left its been pretty much Pittmans show on the ground much to the chagrin of Thomas Jones owners And on the other side of the ball the Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for On the ground they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB S o this once could truly go either way Id feel ok with Pittman if he was my guy but I wouldnt be overly excited Robert Smith Min vs Lion Defense This isnt the best matchup in the world for Smith but you have to start him If nothing else than to get an early lead on your opponent with a Thursday night game Cmon that s worth something Seriously Smith is one of the elite RBs right now bu t Detroit is playing pretty tough against the run ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Hes a starter though just play him Ahman Green GB vs Bear Defense Find a nice toasty place to watch this one Chicago in December At night Thats football With Dorsey Lev ens likely gone for the year the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man Chicago has a tough run defense led by all world rookie Brian Urlacher I told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him Vanilla Freak and now youre seeing why I love this kid These guys are professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy with the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature keeps dropping Lamar Smith Mia vs Bills Defense Smith practiced Wednesday and while it s awful early to make a definitive call it looks like hell start Sund ay The Bufallo defense is solid against the rush They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Although for the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Although if Smith can return to his awesome form before the injury hell be a load The Dolphins will rely on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus not that good to begin with Marshall Faulk StL vs Panther Defense Lets hope Faulk gets back to his old form And lets hope the Panther defense gets back more their old rushing defense form Over the last four games Carolina ranks in rushing yards allowed per game But for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB It sounds to me like coach Mi ke Martz wont make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best we apons in Faulk Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Shawn Bryson Sammy Morris Antowain Smith Buf vs Miami Defense Believe it or not the Dolphin Defense ranks just in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Granted of those games don t factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have thought The Bills rushing game is a mess The team is calling Morris ankle questionable so well have to wait and see Bryson has done very little with the opportunity and we know Smith didnt produce or we woul d have never seen so much of Bryson and Morris With a healthy Zach Thomas Id probably shy a bit from any of these guys Emmitt Smith Dal vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith said hed never been knocked out in his career but thats what happened Thursday Hes bo unced back quickly and says hell certainly be the starter Sunday The Bucs are tough but not invincible Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game giving up yards per game on the ground Emmitts made a living running the ball against tough defenses over his career so Im not overly concerned with the matchup Hes a gamer and Id say hes probably a starter for most owners this week even facing Tampa Bay Stephen Davis Was vs Giants Defense Be very leery here Stephen Dav is demonstrated last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of salt Players are notoriously optimistic about their chances for recoveri ng from injury Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I w as sure hed start Id think very hard about going elsewhere this week Its not like hes facing Seattle and this is a dream matchup or something The Giants are tough against the run ranking for the year in Fantasy Point s allowed to the opposing RB So unless you know for sure hes going I d strongly consider my other options Terrell Fletcher SD vs er Defense Fletcher is probable with a rib fracture which must sound worse than it is Either that or hes one tou gh guy The problem is that San Francisco is playing much improved defense lately Against the rush over the last four weeks they rank in rushi ng yards allowed per game Thats a marked contrast to their year long numbers where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Adding Fletchers ribs to the improved Defense I dont see much fro m San Diego on the ground Sunday Ron Dayne Tiki Barber NYG vs Redskins To me Barber is looking muc h more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I dont see New York taking a lead where they can grind out the clock If youre a Dayne own er youre painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in favor of Barber when his team trails The Giants are a good team but I d on t see them jumping all over Washington Plus the Redskins play very good rush defense For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to t he opposing RB and over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game James Stewart Det vs Viking Defense Stewarts great game against Ta mpa Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but hes go t a surprisingly tough situation here Minnesota over the last four weeks ran ks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Part of that has to do with the Vikings explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up but part of it is that the Vikings are just improved there LB Dwayne Rud d should miss the game with a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but Im still not overly excited about the matchup Still though Stewart is one of the better backs and Id think hes likely a starter for your team unless youre loaded with RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Darnell Autry Stanley Pritchett Phi vs Titan Defense The Eagle RBs have been very little factor and I dont see them all of a sudden emerg ing against a very tough Tennessee defense Especially one in a foul mood afte r another last second loss from the kicker Its a tough job but QB Don ovan McNabb carries this team almost solely on his shoulders He could be the teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs For th e year the Titans rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Mike Anderson Den vs Saints Defense I like Mike Anderson and hes a great story but hes got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans The Saints rank for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last four games they rank in rushing yards allowed pe r game Theyve just averaged yards per game allowed rushing Anders on is still probably worth a start unless youre really deep at RB but just b e aware hes facing a tough defense Charlie Garner SF vs Charger Defense With a week off to prepare Garne r comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first victory Theyre playing rush defense like were accustomed to seei ng from San Diego ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Garner isnt your normal back but hes facing a tough game h ere I d still start him as hes got that big play potential with the ability to go the distance at any time but Im not excited about the matchup Jerome Bettis Pit vs Raider Defense Jerome Bettis was built for grinding down defenses in the December cold but hell have a tough match up this week against Oakland The Raiders rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Thats partly why their passing defe nse is so bad teams cant run so they go to the air I like Bettis and I t hink hell be able to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a difficult matchup here Jerald Moore Chad Morton NO vs Bronco Defense Assuming Moore is ok with his neck stinger hell be running behind his outstanding OL but t his is a tough matchup against the Denver Defense thats remained tough vs the run Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing an average of yards per game Ricky Watters and Seattle only managed to post against them Sunday Moore looks to get the majority of carries and goalline work so hes the better option at this point assuming he can go But even healthy hes got his work cut out for him To unsubscribe from this group

still in the hunt this late in the year you have to call a successful campaign Enjoy it Its an intense time and you cant slack off n ow but its also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens in t he next few weeks Its tough enough just to get to this point Great w ork From my perspective its interesting in that the actual number of folks who read the material drops way off this time of year But the other side of the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading shoots throu gh the roof There may not be as many folks reading as there were in September but the ones that are here are into in a big way Ill do my dead level best to keep up my end of the bargain and provide the best info I can all the way to the week games Lets get at it Joe Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Passing Game Matchups Heres how I see the matchups this week Please note see the cheatsheet online will be availablelate Wednesday evening atweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be mor e favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more too l in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software f or more info The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position numbers are from ESPNcom Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Bronco Defense I stuck my neck out a bit last week with QB Aaron Brooks but he came though for me This week he draws a great matchup with a Denver defense thats not been able to sto p anyone through the air Over the last four weeks they rank in passi ng yards allowed per game Denver has averaged giving up yards passing p er game over that span With CB Ray Crockett out with a torn hamstring Jim my Spencer will fill in for him again this week He and Terrell Buckley can definitely be beaten Brooks will focus on WR Joe Horn his primary weapon but Willie Jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option RB Chad Morton catches the ball pretty well out of the backfield TE Aaron Glove r still is total non factor for Fantasy purposes Im doing my best to not get carried away with Brooks Keep telling yourself the young man has exactly games of NFL experience On the other hand there comes a time when you take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes This gu y isnt playing like a game rookie and the Denver defense is awful St Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense I want to believe I believe in Kurt Warner and I believe hell get his Rams back on track As much as anything I believe youll see Marshall Faulk at least see more action than he saw last week Warners an MVP but I think its Faulk that make s this team go He creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commi t safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game If the defense plays the pass then Faulk can kill them with the run or short passes After last week Id be shocked if coach Mike Martz doesnt get back to utilizinghisstar RBmore Kurt Warner makes his return and I m guessing he picks up where he left off Thats not what youd expec t to happen but Warners made a career of exceeding expectations If he s on your roster I think you have to go with him Especially against this defense Carolina ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For WRs its always tough to pick Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are the sure guys but honestly Ricky Proehls been on fire lately AzZahir Hakim is always worth a shot too Any one of these guy s can go off TE Roland Williams suffers with so many good receivers but he s a decent producer too Atlanta Passing Game vs Seattle Defense This one is a pure matchup play as Dan Reeves makes the move for startingQB Doug Johnson over the fading Chris Chandler Im not a big fan of either but if you find yourself f aced with the prospect of starting a Falcon QB this is the week to do it if yo u re ever going to The Seahawks defense is less like a hawk and more like an albatross around Mike Holmgrens neck Theyre awful Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Good luck picki ng the WR as Terrance Mathis has been invisible lately while Shawn Jefferson is making a resurgence A few weeks ago it was Mathis who was hot while Jefferson faded If you made me pick one Id reluctantly go with Jefferson TE Reggie Kelly did catch passes Sunday but Im not count ing on him for too much Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Raider Defense KorDELLKorDELLKorDE LL What brought this guy back to life I dunno but you can bet coach Bill Cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling Kordell Stewar t looks to be playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much o f the game at this level is mental No one ever doubted his physical skills The obvious spark seems to have been the benching of WR Plaxico Burress and the inspired play of Hines Ward I think its ironic that W ard was very much a Kordelllike Slash player in college at Georgia Bobby Shaw is getting into the act and producing from the WR slot and wonders of wonders TE Mark Bruener caught a TD Sunday You know things are changin g when Bruener gets in the endzone The Raiders are an extremely good football team but stopping teams through the air is their Achilles heel Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Another interesting aspect o f writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December ar e stocked with the obvious stars QB Scott Mitchell likely doesnt fall into that star category and I doubt many folks are faced with the decis ion to start him this week but if hes your best QB this might be your lucky week First of all lets assume he gets the knee ready to go This e arly in the week thats honestly a shaky assumption Well know more l ater But if he can go he could do some damage against an awful Cardinal defense WR Peter Warrick could be a decent play too although Aeneas Williams is a solid cover guy Hes hard to count out though just beca use of his home run ability Funny how I dont see many people complaining about his times now RB Corey Dillon is the only other starter on this team but well catch up with him in the rushing Matchups Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Lets be clear Im no Jake Plummer fan but the truth of the matter is hes got a pretty decent matc hup this week Hes reportedly making good progress and should start Sunda y Partly because hes better partly because Dave Brown was just awful Worse than Plummer has a nasty ring to it But this Bengal pa ss defense is pretty bad Over the past four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game WRs David Boston has the physical tools to do some damage and Frank Sanders has the experience to make an impact Remember this is the unit that made Pittsburgh look like the Rams last week New York Jets Passing Game vs Colts Defense The Jets have been up and do wn a bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling Indianapolis defense The pathetic Colt pass rush only has sacks in th e last games QB Vinny Testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup with yards and TD WR Wayne Chrebets been in a funk lately but in their week he went off catching passes for Sure some of it was late but garbage stats count too Dedric Ward caught just yards worth of passes but he scored in that game Hes come on lately after fadin g early Rookie WR Laveranues Coles will miss another game it appears RB Curtis Martin still is struggling to get healthy and that will hurt a little TE Anthony Becht is a bright spot as hes beginning to contrib ute December in New York will make a difference to this soft Colt team which doesnt play as well in the cold Detroit Passing Game vs Viking Defense Charlie Batch continued to look good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his well deserved candybone label with a gutsy performance on Thanksgiving His ribs are reportedly better and he had a nice practice Tuesday throwing the ball The Viking secondary could have matchup troubles with WRs Johnnie Morton a nd Herman Moore Over the last four weeks Minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs The Vikings are tough on TEs ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to TEs for the year but TE David Sloan has played very well of late He ranks in Fantasy Points among TEs over the last games and is well worth a start here Denver Passing Game vs Saints Defense For all the hype generated by New Orleans defense they give up tons of yards passing Over the last fo ur weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game They do sack the QB a ton over the last four weeks but they still give up the yards I t s kind of unusual to see that Theyll be facing Gus Frerotte and a Den ver team thats trying to find their way Frerottes been up and down after his monster week game The Saints continue to drop like flies and the loss of CB Fred Weary will definitely hurt Both WRs Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey are solid plays as always And as crazy as it sounds either one of the headed TE monster in Dwayne Carswell and Desmond Clark are decen t options too Byron Chamberlain normally makes it a headed TE monster bu t hes nursing a bad Achilles tendon and didnt play last week As no ted above Denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a hig h scoring affair I doubt you could have predicted a shootout between Aaron Brooks and Gus Frerotte months ago but thats why they play the games Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Chicago Passing Game vs Packer Defense Im torn here You probably saw how weak the Packer defense looked Monday night They couldnt do muc h of anything But on the other hand the Bears will likely go with Shane Matthews and hes been just awful lately Like worse than Dave Brown kind of bad One would think hed improve against this defense but hell have to make great strides just to get reach average Owners of WR Marcus Robinson feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately wit h Matthews at the helm Still though theres some hope On a brighter spot Matthews does seem comfortable throwing to Eddie Kennison who had passes thrown to him Sunday compared to Robinsons Ive hear rum ors that Chicago may start a TE but that news is unconfirmed at this time In t he for real rumor department QB Cade McNown is making noise about wanting to start this week but I think its still a week early New England Passing Game vs Chief Defense Kansas City and New England ar e two once proud teams that are struggling This week a banged up Drew Bledsoefaces a pass defense thats been vulnerable Over the last fou r weeks Kansas City ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year KC ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs Bledsoe bruised a knee in Thursdays game but played through it and should be o k Keep an eye on him though as he was added to the injury report this week a s Questionable As long as Bledsoe plays WR Terry Glennshould be a good option as hes clearly the guy in that offense over Troy Brown TE Rod Rutledge caught passes last week so he may start to make some noise With all those productive years throwing to Ben Coates you know Bledsoe would love to have a solid TE Carolina Passing Game vs Rams Defense Even if you want to pin Carolina s Monday Night performance on a weak Green Bay defense credit still must be given to Steve Beuerleinand the Panthers The immobile Beuerlein hung in there and delivered Hes facing a Rams defense that even with Bud Car sons help still ranks in passing yards allowed per game Granted that s a big improvement Beuerleins numbers may be helped by the return of Ram QB Kurt Warner as theres nothing like the other team rolling up points to get your QBs arm loose WR Muhsin Muhammad had the dominating game we all know he can and looked overpowering The hamstring injury was supposed to be with him all year but he looks good to me Another boost for Beuerlein will be if WR Donald Hayescan get back on the field as early reports are hoping for Even TE Kris Mangumbe the one guy in your leag ue that doesnt say magnum like the gun has been looking good For the year St Louis ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the TE so he could be worth a shot Jacksonville Passing Game vs Browns Defense This one really is a case of misdirection as QB Mark Brunellisnt as good as many people think and the Browns pass defense isnt as bad as most people assume Cleveland rank s in passing yards allowed per game And for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs which really surprises people The reason is that their rush defense is awful and teams choose to run instead But all you really care about are the stats Brunell should be ok but not great here as the Jaguars look to take out a seasons worth of frustrat ions on the Browns Jimmy Smithand Keenan McCardellare solid choices as usual Even the much maligned by me anyway rookie R Jay Sowardproduc ed last week Soward could actually be bad news for McCardell and Smith as there were times when Brunell really seemed to force the ball his way T E Kyle Bradyis solid But honestly I think this will be the Fred Taylor on the ground show against a weak rush unit Washington Passing Game vs Giant Defense Brad Johnsonmakes his return this week taking over for Jeff George Its interesting to watch how t he Redskins spin this transition According to Washington Johnson starting has nothing to do with Jeff Georges less than spectacular play or reco rd Johnson was the starter all along regardless of how George played yada yada This type of talk makes it easier to sell the fans Jeff Geor ge as the starting QB next year Well see for the record Im a George fan and have been for a while Myself and other guys are pretty much it Like most players in this could go either way category Johnson has good and bad points this week On the upside the Giants defense has shown itself to be vulnerable to the pass The Redskins also hope to have RB Stephen Davisthis week His presence does a great deal for the passing game On the downside Johnson will likely be rusty He may still be feeling some lingering effects of the injury Secondly his best WR Albert Connellmay play but hes nowhere near full speed James Thrashfilled in admirably for Connell and looks to be a good play this wee k as well It looks like Irving Fryarwill get the start opposite Thrash The ageless wonder might do something if Jason Sehorn stays with Thrash as Dave Thomas is by far the weaker CB TE Stephen Alexanderis a steady performer although FB Larry Centerssteals too many of the short passes th at could go to Alexander New York Giant Passing Game vs Redskin Defense A good defense takes on a good passing offense I guess thats why this matchup is in this colu mn Over the last four weeks Washington ranks in passing yards allowed p er game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing Q Bs so theyre pretty tough QB Kerry Collinshas quietly played extremely well over the last month Hes thrown for yards and TDs over the last games That puts him at in Fantasy Points among QBs over that time span WR Amani Toomercontinues to play great football and is definitely worth a shot Joe Jureviciusfills in for the injured Ike Hilliard again and hes a solid choice as Collins didnt hesitate to throw him the ball often TE Pete Mitchell is tough to depend on as he gets more catches but Dan Campbellgrabs the TDs it seems Im not too excited about ei ther guy San Diego Passing Game vs er Defense My Charger buddies have cautioned me about jumping on the Ryan LeafBandwagon That was right after Id se nt a group email at halftime of the SD KC game to some friends boasting about my QB Leaf Of course we know the nd half didnt go quit e as well as the first and I came back to reality But theres some truth to the i dea Leaf is becoming an NFL QB I personally had doubts if wed ever see i t but I think its starting to happen And this week against a San Francisc o defense he could make some more strides It should be noted the ers ar e much better on pass defense than they had been Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game which is a huge upgrade from where they had been For the year though they still rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Leaf has some extremely solid receivers TE Freddie Jonesis his best target but veteran WRs Jeff Graha m and Curtis Conwayare more than capable Youd think that San Francis co will score some points so there could be some fireworks Id shy away f rom Leaf but Jones in particular could be a very nice play San Francisco Passing Game vs Charger Defense The Charger defense held Kansas City down last week but I think that had more to do with Warren Moo n s senior citizen status than it did the Charger D Granted theyre improving but I think San Francisco should be able to move the ball Ove r the last four weeks San Diego ranks in passing yards allowed per game QB Jeff Garciais coming off a bye week and should be rested and prepared His biggest problem will be the toe injury to WR Terrell Owens Owens was unable to complete practice Monday and its now looking like it could be later this week before he sees the practice field Coach Steve Mariucci didnt sound too optimistic Although I can imagine worse scenarios for a WR than having Jerry Riceas your best WR Owens will definitely be missed but JJ Stokesand Tai Streetswill fill in just fine There had been some talk from Mariucci about resting Garcia to see how the rookie QBs Gio Carmazzi and Tim Rattay would fare in game situations I think this is just talk at this point I dont really see the Chargers blowing out San Francisco to the point Garcia could be pulled If Garcia gets San Francisco such a lead that he could be pulled he would have probably earned a great day of stats by then anyway At least for this week Im thinking hell be fine in the playing time department Minnesota Passing Game vs Lion Defense Ok this is tough matchup for the Vikings Detroit ranks in passing yards allowed per gameover the last four games But the Lions are dealing with several injuries in their secondary including Safety Ron Rice leg probable Kurt Schulz ankledoubtful and nickel back Marquis Walker wristout Still though youre crazy if you dont start QB Daunte Culpepperand WRs Randy M ossand Cris Carter Theyre just too good Kansas City Passing Game vs Patriot Defense Its early to make a call but its looking like QB Elvis Grbacwill be back this week Thats gr eat news for Chief fans and Fantasy Owners The Patriots rank in passing yar ds allowed per game over the last four weeks but those numbers are a little skewed as Detroit Cincinnati Cleveland and Buffalo were the opponents Its not like they shut down the Rams or ers Grbac will look to ge t his target TE Tony Gonzalezback on track after he was shut out by the Chargers I dont think youll see that again with Grbac under cent er WR Derrick Alexanderis an excellent target too Rookie Sylvester Morrisseems to be fading instead of getting better He may be hitting th e infamous rookie wall Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Dallas Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith seems recovered from his knockout slap Thursday and says hell start That s good news for all aspects of the Dallas offense QB Troy Aikmansquares off again st a Tampa defense thats bark is worse than its bite Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Although they have registered sacks over that span which is towards the top of the league Theyre solid though WRs Wayne McGarityand James McKnighta re showing theyre not anything exceptional TE Jackie Harriswas injure d last week and David LaFluerwoke up with a great game Cleveland Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense One has to ask if anyone really cares whether QBsDoug Pedersonor Spergon Wynngets the majority of the snaps I think I can say fairly confidently that neither of these guys ha ve been figuring heavily into your plans The Jaguar defense has improved significantly of late They rank in passing yards allowed per gameover the last four weeks and they should be plenty good enough to contain the Browns This team never really had a chance once Tim Couch an d Errict Rhett went down Kevin Johnsonand David Patten handle the WR duties but I cant advocate either with a clear conscience TE AaronSh ea will start for the Browns but probably not for your FF Team Green Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense Its hard to know what to thin k about Green Bay One game they look like the Packers of old with Favre working his magic and the next they look like a shell of their former selves as they did on Monday Night against a Carolina team that had no business handling them as they did Brett Favreis still a decent bet t o sling a few TDs on any Sunday but hes sadly become just an average Fan tasy QB Lately the Bears have been tough against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Although for th e year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Favre will have the very disappointing Antonio Freemanto throw to although Bil l Schroederis putting up better numbers the last few weeks He has another advantage in that while Freeman will likely draw CB Thomas Smith Schroede r likely goes against Jerry Azumah Remember Schroeder came up huge in the week matchup with TDs in the th quarter For a TE Id go with Bu bba Franksalthough whenever I say that it seems Tyrone Daviscatches a TD Seattle Passing Game vs Falcon Defense This is an interesting game as tw o proud coaches in Dan Reeves and Mike Holmgren lead teams that are floundering The one bright spot for the Falcons is that theyve yield ed few yards passing although the glass is half empty crowd will poin t out that the reason for that is the weak rush defense Why throw the ball whe n you can run on Atlanta Regardless of the reason teams dont throw mu ch against the Falcons and I dont look for QB Jon Kitnato completely bre ak that trend Hell be looking to quiet producers Sean Dawkinsand Derric k Mayes Dawkins in particular has been exceptional over the last few weeks and is probably worth a start Indianapolis Passing Game vs Jets Defense I love Peyton Manningbut he s a guy that doesnt always post the Fantasy Football numbers to match hi s hype Hes a solid producer wholl very rarely burn you but hes also not too subject to the yard TD day With that said I think youll see another good solid day from him against a Jet defense thats tough Ov er the last four weeks New York ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Manning will try to jump start his team thats floundering a bit The y know they need a win and a team like this can be tough when cornered Im not heeding the grumblings about WR Marvin Harrison Hes fine He ca ught TDs last week and has stated he needs to get on a mission althou gh he needs some help Jerome Pathonhad some horrendous drops EG Greenhopes to be back this week from a knee injury and that will be good news Terrenc e Wilkins and Pathon just arent getting it done TEs Marcus Pollardand Ken Dilgerboth catch just enough to make neither guy very valuable Oakland Passing Game vs Steeler Defense QB Rich Gannonis garnering lots of talk about the league MVP Could be But hes got a tough matchup th is week against a Steeler team playing with confidence Pittsburgh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the seaso n they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB so thats strong WRTim Brownis the clear cut target of choice and that makes thing s great for Brown owners You know hell get his touches Andre Risonand James Jettwill get the scraps left over TE Ricky Dudleyis a guy who you play totally at your own risk Hes just as liable to go catchless as he is score TDs Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Miami Passing Game vs Bills Defense Lets seeJay Fiedlercoming back from a shoulder injury in what will likely be horrible weather conditions against the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Thats what youve got in this game and its e nough to have me looking elsewhere if Ive got Dolphin passing game players I d start who ever you did last week if Fiedler is your QB If you have to start a Miami WR Id roll the dice on the unheralded Leslie Shepherdw hos catching more than anyone thought he would Slim pickings with this matchup after that Buffalo Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense Lets seeRob Johnsoncom ing back from his latest injury in what will likely be horrible weather conditions against the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks This sounds familiar Seriously this game ought to be a defensive struggle as two dominant defenses square off in the snow against mediocre offenses Rob Johnson will get the start but as usual wont finish the game Eric Mouldswill gather the majority of catches and is probably too good not to start just because hes so talented and he doe s grab the lions share of passes thrown TE Jay Reimersmais fast regaining his place as one of the best TEs in the game and depending on the weather here he could be the best receiving choice Philadelphia Passing Game vs Titan Defense Understand that this is a bad matchup for Donovan McNabband the Eagles but so was last week against Washington And all McNabb did was win Offensive Player of the Week honors Outside of McNabb and TE Chad Lewis I cant recommend any oth er players as starters Neither WRsCharles Johnsonor Torrance Smallscare anyone The Titans are an athletic and physical unit that youd think would give McNabb trouble And truthfully the Washington game would have likely been different if spy LaVarr Arrington hadnt been hurt early The lack of a passing game threat really hurts as Tennessee will likely be able to handle the WRs with man coverage and commit more personnel to the run and McNabb Still if hes by far your best QB Id roll the dice with him as hes made a season out of proving people wrong Tennessee Passing Game vs Eagle Defense Steve McNairranks among QB s over the last games in Fantasy Points per game Thats not real solid I dont see him suddenly improving his play against an Eagle defense that ranks in passing yards allowed per game And for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB The Eagles have sacks over the last games and while McNair is tough guy to sack its obvio us the Eagles will pressure him His WR corps in Derrick Masonand Chris Sandersarent the greatest As usual his best option will be TE Fran k Wycheck Wycheck struggled last week with some uncharacteristic drops bu t this week he could be an asset as McNair likely wont have a lot of tim e to throw Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Who knows where the Shaun KingRoller Coaster Ride will take us this week Hes nursing a back s train but practiced Wednesday and looks good to go The Cowboys surprisingly hav e played decent pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game Of course thats largely because no team feels the need to throw the b all when they can run at will King will spread the ball between WRs Keyshaw n Johnsonand Jacquez Green Im not especially excited about either bu t it s very hard to turn your back on Keyshawn TE Dave Mooreis a fine produc er and Id feel comfortable starting him To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

and Cats in the scoring box was one of the more annoying moves theyve made this season Cats Thats so lame Enough of that lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head down the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from th e sidelines As we head into our th week of listing these players it s inevitable that some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players th at are moving In other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on t he downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league I t just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewi se a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he s still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make a ll the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Kordell Stewart Pit Time to give props where props are due Kordel l looks like a new man Actually he looks like the old Kordell The GOOD old Kordell Over the last three weeks he ranks as the QB in my Performance TD system based on FF points per game Gotta hand it to Bi ll Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting WRs like that but Hines Ward has delivered Its probably not the best thing for Jerome Betti s owners but Stewarts rushing TDs over the last weeks are huge QB Aaron Brooks NO Brooks made my upgrade list last week and I put my money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league to pick him up last week as a free agent I said last week that wed see how he does with the pressure on all week Obviously this is one cool kid If y ou saw the footage of him in the tunnel before the game he looked like he was ready to go out and play a game of flag football or something He made some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times The obvious comparison is a young Randall Cunningham Hes skinny and has a littl e bit of those Cunningham crazy legs Plus hes got a big arm with that whipp y motion But the biggest thing that impresses me about Brooks is his poise Grab him if hes available in your league I asked my friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks Tony had him ranked higher than Shaun King before the draft Heres wha t the TFY Draft Preview had for Brooks AARON BROOKS Virginia Fifth year senior who completed of his passes throwing for yards touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the ball times for yards averaging yards per carry with five more scores Led the ACC i n passing efficiency two seasons ago throwing for Go od athlete who has shown great improvement in his quarterback skills the last season and a half Smooth and fluid sets his feet in the pocket shows good strength and stands his ground when being rushed Has a live arm ca n thread a needle throws ropes and his deep passes have speed Effective throwing on the run squares his shoulders and quickly releases the ball Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers pulls the ball down running betwee n the tackles While he has improved his accuracy and places his passes wel l he often overthrows receivers The further down the field or out to the flanks he must get the ball the more his accuracy struggles Must do a better job reading and recognizing defenses stop staring down his primary target and not hold the ball so long while in the pocket A player who turned himself into a good prospect with a solid senior campaign Mid to late Sixth Round Thanks Tony Be sure to check out Tonys great info at wwwTFYDraftPreviewcom QB Kurt Warner StL Warners chomping at the bit and has been named the starter this week relieving Trent Green Keep an eye out on how he looks in practice Coach Mike Martz said last week he was concerned about Warner s grip strength and ability to put rotation on the ball Im thinking he ll be good to go QB Donovan McNabb Phi What else can you say about this guy Take awa y his running game No problem Give him WRs that would struggle to make a division I team No problem He finds a way to get it done He looks to me like hes beginning to reach the level of dominance he enjoyed at Syracuse where he was unstoppable Its especially impressive as team s know what hes going and still cant stop him It should be noted th at LaVarr Arrington was injured early and he was the designated spy b ut still it was an impressive performance against a very good Washington defense I see little reason why he wont continue although he really needs help at WR QB Trent Dilfer Bal I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer might pla y the late season Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives anothe r struggling QBs career Dilfer seems very comfortable with what Bill ick is asking him to do and brings a little fire and attitude to the offense that had been missing I like what theyre doing and dont see why it wont continue Although dont forget theyre off this week QB Brad Johnson Was Jeff George yields to the young man from Florida State His knee is reportedly good to go and hes been cleared by the trainers as fit to start Considering the troubles the team endured with George at the helm Johnson has already been named the starter Hell be working with a nicked WR corps so well see how he fares QB Ryan Leaf SD Kordell Stewart Trent Dilfer and Ryan Leaf You gott a be kidding me But after another solid outing you cant deny Leaf is making plays Granted he still throws the ugly interceptions and he ge ts hurt almost as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for you if you need a spot QB Hes got one of the top TEs in the game with Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are veterans who can make a difference This win will have to buoy the spirits and enthusiasm RBs Moving Up RB Mike Anderson Den Once is a coincidence Twice is a trend Youv e got to start handing credit to Mike Shanahan Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia k and that offensive line Like everyone else I marveled at the way Olandis Gary was able to run last year when Terrell Davis went down What a great job of scouting we all thought But hey Gary was a pretty highly touted back But Mike Anderson Andersons a fine back but Ive got to believe its a team deal here The good news is that Andersons team isn t going anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell Davis recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment Watch this during the week b ut it wouldnt surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game And as l ong as Anderson rolls up rushing yards a game like he did Sunday you won t see Shanahan crying over TD being out Granted of those yards came on one big run but he had a great game any way you slice it RB Jamal Lewis Bal Ive been eating crow Raven for a while now a s I was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at this level after a very disappointing season at Tennessee Lewis is running like he did as a Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have the best blend of speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George Coach Brian Billick has the Raven offense firing on all cylinders and Lewi s remains a huge part of it His only down side is that hes off this we ek with a bye But that week matchup against Arizona is looking very tasty RB Corey Dillon Cin Considering what he does with that surrounding cas t I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back in the NFL There have been few passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the Bengals yet Dillon continues to pound out the yards when defenses know exactly whats coming at them Its amazing to watch I dont k now how long he can keep it up but hes got the woeful Cardinals this week and you have to like that RB Warrick Dunn TB Dunn made the upgrade list last week in the wake of Mike Alstotts knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his owners Sunday with total yards including TDs There was some talk about him sharing carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the ball for Tampa Bay Look for more of the same from the Bucs and new offensive coordinator Warren Sapp Seriously Dunn showed he could hand le rushing attempts and I think youll continue to see them go with what s working RB Michael Pittman Ari Pittman may be the lone bright spot on the Arizona team I told you last week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and you saw the results last night as Pittman rambled for yards on only carries ypc Like Corey Dillon the surrounding team kills his value but if he ran for a team that held a lead hed be awesome Unfortunate ly I dont see Arizona turning into such a team anytime soon so dont get too excited But overall I like the guy a lot RB Richie Anderson NYJ Each year there are always unheralded guys who post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners Many tim es they are RBs who quietly post yardage and FF points receiving the ball Anderson is a prime example of one such player this year asare Tony Richardson and Stanley Pritchett Hes caught passes over the last games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus that trend wil l likely continue RB Robert Holcombe StL It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see th at Marshall Faulk isnt Red flags went up across the country when M ike Martz elected to give Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday weeks ago that would have been Faulks carry all day long Holcombe looks to benefit if Faulks workload continues to be decreased RB Brad Hoover Car Aside from having one of those cool names the fans can yell whenever he does something good Hoover has shown to be a capable replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka He doesnt have the physical tools of a Biakabutuka but you cant deny he hasnt been effective It wouldnt surprise me a bit to see Hoover continue to see action WRs Moving Up WR Marvin Harrison Ind Harrison stated before Sundays game that he needed to get on a mission Looked like he started towards that e nd with TD catches and he could have had another Yes youd like to see mo re than catches but Ill take TDs any week Harrisons biggest worr y is that Peyton Manning can stay calm enough not to strangle Jerome Pathon for dropping easy balls Harrison is fine and actually looking better in my eyes WR Hines Ward Pit Does anyone else find it interesting to see Kordell Stewart throwing the ball to another slash type player in Hines Wa rd Ward doesnt have the name of a Plaxico Burress but hes certainly m ore productive If Im Burress Id be for finding a baseball cap that I was comfortable with WR Amani Toomer NYG Toomers back in a big way He had us worried t here for a stretch earlier but hes playing very well right now especially with Ike Hilliard out QB Kerry Collins has settled into a nice rhythm and coach Jim Fassell is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a playoff slot Look forToomer and Collins to be a big part of making that happen WR Sean Dawkins Ind With his size Ive always wondered why he isnt better Hes showing over the last few games that mayb e he is Over the last games he rates as the WR in Fantasy Points per game It doesnt seem to make a great deal of difference to him whethe r it s Jon Kitna or Brock Huard throwing the ball he just delivers WR Peter Warrick CinGarbage time or not he scored another TD this week and hes a great gamble if you need to roll the dice for a home run Y es hes as liable to go for as he is score a TD but sometimes those are the kinds of gambles that pay big The team reportedly was forcing him t o see an eye doctor for contact lenses This could be like Charlie Sheen in Major League with the new glasses Seriously if hes had bad vision t hats been limiting him look out once he gets the contacts WR Joe Jurevicius NYG With Ike Hilliard out Jurevicius got all he eve r wanted a chance And hes making the most of it Hes clearl y the WR behind Toomer but when this offense is clicking the guy has definite value Keep an eye on Hilliards return but he could be a nice sub if you re in a pinch WR Willie Jackson NO Jackson is looking less fluky with each g ame He put together a nice day Sunday with catches for yards Like Jurevicius hes the clear cut receiver but hes certainly valua ble QB Aaron Brooks has surprised everyone and Jackson should continue to benefit WR R Jay Soward Jac Ill be honest I really dont like Soward much but you cant dismiss the fact Mark Brunell seemed to almost be forcing the ball to him on the long throws Hell draw the weaker coverage and rightly so when Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are in the lineup so he could have some mismatches TEs Moving Up TE Freddie Jones SD Jones is still under the radar of a few owners as he plays for the Chargers Truth is hes one of the better receivers i n the game and definitely the best receiver in San Diego Hes a nice big tar get with soft hands for new QB Ryan Leaf Hes had receptions over the last games TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersmas returning to the player we knew he could be With receptions for yards Sunday hes a vital part of the offense With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel not doing much it s pretty much Eric Moulds and Reimersma TE David LaFluer Dal With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained knee LaFlu er seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with catches f or yards and a TD Keep an eye on Harris but this could be a trend TE Anthony Becht NYJ Becht earns the upgrade just for the beautiful diving TD catch Sunday At this point in the season rookies arent re ally rookies any more as most have enough experience that theyre learning t he ropes Becht appears to be a fast learner and could give this team a huge boost with solid TE play QBs Moving Down QB Jeff George Was Audition time is over Didnt you have the feeling owner Danny Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild befor e Brad Johnson sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year i f they ever do that Instead he looked very average and even a little bit old Brad Johnson will get the start this week You never know with knee injuries so George certainly still has value just nothing like he did as a starter QB Trent Green StL Chris Berman made a great point last night on ESPN s Prime Time Trent Green is a nice player but lets forget this talk ab out him being the same player as Kurt Warner Another loss for the Rams pretty much guaranteed well see Warner this week The Rams are sudden ly fighting for their lives and it wont be Green behind center QB Shane Matthews Chi The University of Florida has a great program an d always places a large number of players at the next level but Matthews loo ks to be another shot putting QB that simply cant deliver the ball at thi s level Its a testament to coach Steve Spurrier that he can devise sys tems to make guys like Matthews and Danny Wuerffel look great in college becaus e they clearly lack the talent Put it this way Matthews has Bears fan wishing Cade McNown will get back soon QB Drew Bledsoe NE Whether its the thumb or the WRs or the play calling Bledsoe is struggling I used to blame this on Bill Belichick coming up with a Jets defense that shattered Bledsoes confidence and t hrew him into a tailspin this time of year but now Ill have to start lookin g for other theories As Terry Glenn said it felt like the defense knew exactly what we were going to do Thats bad for a Thursday game RBs Moving Down RB Emmitt Smith Dal As you probably saw Emmitt was knocked out for a moment during the Thanksgiving Day game Check his status this week Ev en he faces a tough stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa Bay Washington New York Giants and Tennessee RB JJ Johnson Mia Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early indicatio ns are that Lamar Smith will be ready to play this week and that means Johnso n takes a seat RB Jamal Anderson Atl It looks to me like the Falcons are very close t o packing it in He may be worth one more start against the porous Seattle defense this week but after that hes got a bye and then New Orleans RB Marshall Faulk StL Understand hes still a top RB but I think h is value is clearly falling a bit He looks less than but the most telling indicator by far was the Robert Holcombe goalline carry weeks ago no way does Holcombe get that carry Hes still a must start and Warner will likely help his stock but Im a little worried RB Curtis Martin NYJ The weather conditions made it tough to get a tru e picture of Martins health but it was pretty easy to see he wasnt Sunday Between Bernie Parmalee and Richie Anderson coach Al Groh has plenty of options and he doesnt hesitate to go with them RB Jermaine Fazande SD The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher and look s to have lost his starting job Not a huge loss as I doubt you were counti ng on him for too much anyway WRs Moving Down WR Yancey Thigpen Ten Drop this guy if you havent already He mis ses games with a myriad of injuries and when he does see the field he manages to drop key passes WR Marcus Robinson Chi One has to wonder what could have been with Jim Miller healthy Shane Matthews managed to get the ball to his best WR a whopping one time Sunday That will not do WR Sylvester Morris KC Morris has been especially disappointing as one usually expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be going the other way Over the last weeks he ranks as the WR in my TD Performance system Part of that can be attributed to Elvis Grbac Warren Moon but hes not playing well right now WR Terance Mathis Atl Mathis ranks among WRs over the last game s in my TD Performance system Thats not what youre looking for fr om a WR even if it is the Falcons Eagle WRs These guys are just not very good I had especially high hopes for Charles Johnson this year but hes not getting it done WR Wayne Chrebet NYJ As sick as I was of Keyshawn Johnson whining abou t Chrebet not being a WR it looks he may have had a point Chrebet just doesnt have the speed or physical size to make a consistent impact w hen defenses choose to take him out of the game I love the guy and admire his grit and determination but he struggles against double coverage And most WR face double coverage TEs Moving Down TE Andrew Glover NO A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats but nobody told Glover about that little axiom The Saints continue to roll in spite of a virtually non existent TE TE Jackie Harris Dal Keep an eye on Harris as he sprained a knee Sunda y and gave way to David LaFluer catching a ton of passes TE Ricky Dudley Oak Hes maybe the most frustrating player in the g ame As soon as you bench him hell catch TDs but I dont know how man y more reception days I can take from this guy To

Thats something to be prou d of You have to be a little bit lucky to get this far but dont hesitate to pat yourself on the back as skill plays a huge part Judging from the emails tons of you are still in mix Dont forget about our Wall of Champions feature where well showcase league winners Stay tuned for mor e details Its crunch time so lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head down the final weekend for many teams identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference betweendominating your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in the money As we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what wer e talking about is players that are moving In other words a player like T E Ricky Dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough t o be a starter in your league It just means Im concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make t he upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs I ts all about which direction players are moving Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Jeff Garcia SF Cheatsheetsnet Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to roll No coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this we ek QB Donovan McNabb Phi Mixed emotions here as Ive been hyping McNabb fo r weeks as the guy carrying the Eagles offense But seeing him on my opponents roster in the FanEx playoffs yesterday was less than heartening throwing for TDs and yards Just be aware the Eagles are off this week and wont return till week QB Jon Kitna Sea Like Mike Holmgren maybe Ive been too critical of Kitna He continues to play well and while it likely wont be in Seattle he looks like a starter for some team in QB Aaron Brooks NO A telling mark of a great QB is how he performs when he comes with less than his A game Brooks looked much less in synch Sunday and clearly struggled at times making a few bad throws and missing open receivers Yet he hung in and still posted outstanding numbers His rushing yards quietly add to the points Hes a player Im starting him with few reservations QB Kerry Collins NYG You have to believe his confidence is sky high H e obviously benefited from the return of Ike Hilliard who looked very good This team is looking very tough and very balanced right now The running game is just good enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so dominant that it hurts the QB QB Mark Brunell Jac Its really weird When the hype finally subsides about this guy he starts delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype Go figure QB Kurt Warner StL This may have been the greatest QB performance in th e history of the league without scoring a TD The guy was incredible completing of his passes of Completing with an average pa ss of yards is sick The TDs will come as Warner looked as good as Ive ever seen him placing the ball perfectly and directing his offense QB Ray Lucas NYJ Keep an eye on Vinnies groin Better yet watch the injury reports for news on Vinnies groin Thats better We should know more soon but if its serious Lucas will get the start RBs Moving Up RB Marshall Faulk StL I know you dont need me to list him here but it s worth noting I think he may be the best player in the league right now Martz fed him the ball times and he delivered RB Eddie George Ten George showed outstanding pass receiving skills and added receiving TDs to go with his rushing TD He reinjured his sore to e but looks to be ok Keep an eye on it though RB Fred Taylor Jac What a shocker Taylor runs wild again as we predicted He did tweak a knee so watch that but if he can go full speed hes a no brainer starter against just about anyone RB James Allen Chi If departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was dead dont get excited Bears fans hes not hed be spinning in his gra ve to see Allen garner carries Sunday Be a little leery though as a ypc carry average only works when you carry the ball a ton RB Travis Prentice Cle After fading badly Prentice comes roaring back with a TD performance He only had yards on attempts but the TDs are huge The Brown offense featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson occasionally at QB but they looked much better RB Mike Anderson Den What else can you say The Denver OL is having another Pro Bowl season Anderson is a must start vs any team right now RB Ahman Green GB Im very nervous if Im Dorsey Levens right now Greens been an offensive stalwart carrying the load week after week Everyone always knew he had the potential to be this good but now hes delivering RB Emmitt Smith Dal As was mentioned on the broadcast yesterday Someo ne forgot to tell the Redskins this game is a rivalry You know the Cowboys and Emmitt in particular had to enjoy humiliating the Redskins It would be a bold move even for him but I wouldnt be surprised in the least to see Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie before his obligatory three games are up RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes me look bad for dissing him this Summer Against the Cardinals this wee k he has the chance to be even better RB Warrick Dunn TB If Dunn had any help the Bucs would scary Right now hes doing it all by himself Which probably isnt a bad thing for Dunn owners RB Tony Richardson KC Richardson netted ypc on carries Donnell Bennett looks to have cartilage damage to his knee so Richardsons workloa d should increase Its a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther Cunningham to give Richardson more looks RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka Car Dont hold your breath but Biakabutuka is making noises about returning to the lineup this week Well see RB Terry Allen NO In a lesser version of Denvers OL it appears most anyone can run effectively behind these guys Allen looked rejuvenated Sunday and should only get better as he gets familiar with the system RB Chris Warren Phi Remember that hes off this week but if your league runs through week he could be a factor WRs Moving Up WR Sean Dawkins Sea Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong numbers As is Jon Kitna Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could continue his roll WR Torrance Small Charles Johnson Phi Look what QB Donovan McNabb can do when his WRs decide to show up If they can continue to play well thi s team could be scary Remember theyre off this week but return in week WR Amani Toomer NYG Of the resurging Giants Toomers leading the charge Hes making plays all over the field and even had a nice run agai n WR Terrell Owens SF The scary part is he could have been even better th an the yard TD performance Sunday He looked very good coming back from the toe injury and should only get better The ers are trying to nail down their WR corps for and Owens is making a statement WR Ed McCaffrey Den Its easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod Smith but the truth of the matter is that theyre both excellent WRs I love McCaffrey and his th grade shoulder pads Hes the antiEric Dickerson when it comes to pads or lack thereof Easy Ed goes with prett y much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder pads and thats it Oh yeah hes al so a great WR WR Darrell Jackson Sea Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and delivered I see few reasons why he wont continue to shine WR Torry Holt StL Its tough to predict which Ram WR will catch the passes from Warner but as I said several weeks ago Holt may be the best W R on the team And thats no sleight to Isaac Bruce Holts that good WR Terry Glenn NE Glenns putting together one of his most complete seasons And Bledsoes continuing to play pretty good football which help s WR Willie Jackson NO catch TD You gotta like a guy who gets rig ht to the point Joe Horn is the clear threat but Jackson is a serious option too WR Germane Crowell Det This didnt look like a guy returning from a broken leg He should continue to get better as he becomes more involved in the flow of things WR Bobby Shaw Pit It seems hard to believe but Bobby Shaw is a legitimate starter in many leagues Hes getting lots of looks and the Steeler are throwing the ball WR Ike Hilliard NYG Hilliard looked well rested as he roared back onto the scene An sprained knee suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa se Hilliards playing time even further WR Donald Hayes Car Hayes looked better as expected and turned in a nic e game catching passes for yards The Panthers need to remain focused but if they can Hayes could contribute TEs Moving Up TE Johnny McWilliams Min McWilliams again was active catching passes for yards I like any receiver on this team TE Andrew Glover NO Glovers starting to become a very integral part of the New Orleans passing game Its hard to imagine this team losing RickyWilliams Jeff Blake and Cam Cleeland TE Kris Mangum Car Hes no Wesley Walls but hes more than adequate TE Greg Clark SF He only had yards but the receptions were a nice bonus QBs Moving Down QB Scott Mitchell Cin The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the guy we remembered This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential QB Jeff George Was Ive gotta say Im really surprised George didnt post some great numbers Albert Connell isnt nearly as good as he thinks he is and that may be part of the problem QB Steve Beuerlein Car Its clear to everyone that was a career year Hes still subject to a great game here and there but hes just too streaky to lean very heavily on QB Shaun King TB This guy just isnt very good QB Charlie Batch Det Ive never been a big Charlie Batch fan although hes certainly had his days He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and possibly losing Herman Moore wont help Although German Crowell is back QB Troy Aikman Dal I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve Young a call A sore back is one thing Not remembering your kids names is an entirely different matter Its not worth it Guy QB Ryan Leaf SD Part of it was Baltimore A large part of it was Leaf QB Jay Fiedler Mia Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non throwing shoulder The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely whether itll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB QB Vinnie Testeverde NYJ Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may not be serious Hes not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this one RBs Moving Down RB Ron Dayne NYG Its just hard to get excited about starting this guy as hes such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan Hes always liable to grab that short yardage TD but you just dont know when or where theyll happen RB Jerald Moore FA Things change quickly in this league A few weeks ago Moore looked to be the RB Now hes unemployed RB Darnell Autry Phi Id expect that Chris Warren will cut into his time when they return RB Jamel White Cle Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched this week RB Brad Hoover Car He came back to reality this week On top of that it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to t ry and return this week WRs Moving Down WR Herman Moore Det Moore suffereda neck stinger Sunday He could likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good returning from his injury WR Tai Streets SF Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action a s the ers tried to see what they had for but with the return of Terrel l Owens it looks like Streets will be limited WR Courtney Hawkins Pit Hes losing time to Bobby Shaw The Steeler W Rs seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw WR Danny Farmer Cin Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot alongside Peter Warrick but it doesnt look like its going to make any difference WR JJ Stokes SF Like Tai Streets Stokes suffers from the return of Terrell Owens WR Sylvester Morris KC Morris continues his regression which should se nd red flags as owners look towards WR Keyshawn Johnson TB With Shaun King struggling I dont see a brigh t future for Keyshawn ahead He sounds like a politician conceding when he speaks of the team finding its identity in running the ball TEs Moving Down TE Anthony Becht NYJ In the up and down season from Anthony Becht it looks like hes headed down a bit The injury to Testeverde affects his stock in a negative way TE Tony McGee Cin Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he suffered a broken ankle TE Jeff Thomason Phi Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the primary TE TE David LaFluer Dal Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head dow n the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Gus Frerotte Den You have to love Frerotte stepping in and performin g like he did Of course when you throw the ball times good things oft en happen When you throw the ball times with a completion percentage great things happen Look for more of the same QB Kerry Collins NYG The Giants may be struggling but Collins continues to put up excellent Fantasy Football numbers With guys like Kurt Warner and Daunte Culpepper its easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs come from great teams Not always the case as Collins is showing Often times its teams with vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco that provides the QB motivation to play catchup Collins looks comfortab le in the pocket and if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard healthy for four quarters who knows what might happen QB Brett Favre GB Hes baaaaack I said last week that Favre coming ba ck on the bad foot would be storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an d Favre delivered TDs and yards have the Packers riding high and believing they canmake some noise WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an excellent WR and RB Ahman Green is filling the void left by Dorsey Levens QB Aaron Brooks NO I may be in the minority imagine that but I was very impressed with Brooks taking over for Jeff Blake He was not a QB like Jim Miller in Chicago that knew hed be inserted any minute Brooks was thrust into the game and responded very nicely Hes skinny at b ut tall Big league arm and nice mobility Of particular note was hi s tendency to throw to WR Willie Jackson Well see if that continues Sur e hes a long shot but if youre desperate for a QB he could be a nice surprise QB Ryan Leaf SD Hold the presses Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade list Seriously hes an easy target and Ill admit to taking my share of shots but you cant deny the guy has skills Yes there were some fluky plays with Crockett injuring himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw although the TDs on completions did make for a wild looking box scor e for Leaf Hes got some weapons in Jeff Graham Curtis Conway and his bes t receiver TE Freddie Jones Hes as flaky as they come but he might be worth a look if youre dying at QB RBs Moving Up RB Fred Taylor Jac Taylor put together one of the best performances of the year Sunday night The fact that he did it against the very tough rus h defense of the Steelers makes it even all the more impressive This isnt like rolling up yards on the Cowboys or Cardinals Clearly theres reason for huge hope as if he can do this against Pittsburgh he can do it against anyone RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis ran hard Hes got to be consider ed one of the better RBs in the game right now I still worry about how durable hell be but hes looked great lately averaging yards per carr y Sunday for yards If it werent for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin g a TD here and there hed be even higher RB Darnell Autry Phi Autry refuses to hand over the RB job to Stanle y Pritchett or anyone else Hes not very flashy but he gets the job done both rushing and receiving The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in the standings and Autry figures to be a large part of that success RB Ahman Green GB Id be a little worried right now if I were Dorsey Levens Green averaged yards per carry Sunday as he rolled up tot al yards Most importantly was his number of fumbles Zero No ones ever doubted his incredible physical skills but now he seems to be bringing th e mental game to go with it RB Mike Anderson Den I hate to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea t impression of Isaac Bruces maddening on again off again season As you know Davis missed another game and once again Anderson stepped in nicely By now you know its tough to predict what Davis is going to do each week so it looks to me as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons yards per carry reminded many of h is season Hes running with power and speed and finally appears to be over the knee injury I think hes been over it physically for a while no w but it seems hes handling the mental aspect too WRs Moving Up WR Willie Jackson NO New QB Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson responded well with catches and yards including TDs Often times youll see a backup QB favor the backup WRs as theyre familiar with them Well see if this continues I m guessing Brooks will get comfortable throwing to Joe Horn this week but Jackson is still definitely worth a shot WR Joe Jurevicius NYG As I mentioned above QB Kerry Collins is playing very well With Ike Hilliard set to miss some time Jurevicius should get a chance to show what he can do Hes long been a Fantasy Football tease showing flashes but never really having the opportunity for playing time Lets see what he can do WR Terry Glenn NE Ive beenhigh on Glenn since June He made me look good early on but had cooled midseason Hes now back warming up again an d for you Glenn owners your patience is paying off QB Drew Bledsoe didnt have a TD but he did roll up the yards Once again Glenn was the prime target WR Jimmy Smith Jac Smith looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as the Jags awakened their offenseSunday night Smith seems back in synch with QB Mark Brunell and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game There may not be enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug h for Smith WR James McNight Dal Yes hes a long shot considering the horrid play of Troy Aikman Sunday but you have to like a WR whos getting a ton of looks And McNights getting those looks from Aikman Cant make plays without t he ball TEs Moving Up TE Jay Reimersma Buf Weve been waiting for Reimersma to return to form and he looks to be on his way He was heavily involved and seemed comfortable with new QB Rob Johnson He can be a vital part of the offense and you have to think Johnson will continue to utilize him TE Kris Mangum Car Mangums no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a nice target catches for yards is an improvement from what theyve h ad at TE and it looks like hes back and healthy now Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Steve Beuerlein Car Theres only so much a QB can do by himself He lost Wesley Walls a couple of weeks ago I thought Beuerlein could handle losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur y proved too much His OL is less than stellar and hes just not having muc h time to throw QB Shaun King TB King swings back toward the side of mediocrity after a yard passing effort against Chicago It looked that bad too Even for a Les Steckel Offense Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a positive as teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson QB Steve McNair Ten Not all the turnovers Sunday were McNairs fault bu t he certainly had a hand in them His problem remains a lack of healthy WR s and a stellar RB in Eddie George who can carry the load Last year it wa s McNair vulturing TDs from George but it doesnt seem to be a problem this year QB Jake Plummer Ari If youre a regular reader you know Im not a Plummer fan Im especially not a fan now that hes hurt as well He may get back soon but it wont matter for this team thats in shambles offensively RBs Moving Down RB Thomas Jones Ari Jones was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but still you like to see a better yards per carry average than negative RB Kevin Faulk NE Either Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is not a very good football player How else do you explain Faulk earning on e carry while his RB partner JR Redmond was inactive Patrick Pass got th e bulk of the work but was ineffective Im guessing its the fumbling tha t earned his spot in the doghouse RB Ron Dayne NYG As weve said so often in the past Ron Daynes productivity is tied directly to how well the Giants are playing If New York is leading youll see Dayne If theyre trailing its the Tiki Barber show Lately its been more Tiki than Dayne And if the Giants dont make some improvements on defense I dont see that changing RB Travis Prentice Cle Prentice got folks excited early in the year but hes been disappointing of late Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit e and that doesnt look to change anytime soon WRs Moving Down WR Marcus Robinson Chi Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it appears the QB rotation is affecting his play With Shane Matthews starting Robinson had receptions for yards While those numbers are certainly not horrible theyre not quite what we expect from Marcus He could improve with another week of practice but Im a little concerned rig ht now WR Joe Horn NO As I mentioned above I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but there is no way that hes anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff Blake Of special worry was the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable throwing the ball to Willie Jackson WR Donald HayesCar Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu s for next week is uncertain Hes a vital part of the offense and will be missed if he cant go WR Wayne Chrebet NYJ As the Jets have struggled so has Chrebet He turned in another small game Sunday with yards on catches These numbers just wont get it done for a WR WR Ike Hilliard NYG weeks ago it was Amani Toomer taking the hard shot Last week it was Hilliard with the highlight hit He looks like he may miss a game or two which is bad news for Hilliard owners but good news of Joe Jurevicius owners TEs Moving Down TE Reggie Kelly Atl Kellys just too up and down to rely on to any degree When hes featured in the gameplan hesa nice player and can be effective Its just that its so hard to guess what game that will be TE Anthony Becht NYJ Another Jet receiver thats struggling Becht is frustrating as hell show some nice flashes and then disappear for long stretches Im afraid to say hes starting to look likea Jets TE To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairly far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Gus Frerotte Den You have to love Frerotte stepping in and performin g like he did Of course when you throw the ball times good things oft en happen When you throw the ball times with a completion percentage great things happen Look for more of the same QB Kerry Collins NYG The Giants may be struggling but Collins continues to put up excellent Fantasy Football numbers With guys like Kurt Warner and Daunte Culpepper its easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs come from great teams Not always the case as Collins is showing Often times its teams with vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco that provides the QB motivation to play catchup Collins looks comfortab le in the pocket and if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard healthy for four quarters who knows what might happen QB Brett Favre GB Hes baaaaack I said last week that Favre coming ba ck on the bad foot would be storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an d Favre delivered TDs and yards have the Packers riding high and believing they canmake some noise WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an excellent WR and RB Ahman Green is filling the void left by Dorsey Levens QB Aaron Brooks NO I may be in the minority imagine that but I was very impressed with Brooks taking over for Jeff Blake He was not a QB like Jim Miller in Chicago that knew hed be inserted any minute Brooks was thrust into the game and responded very nicely Hes skinny at b ut tall Big league arm and nice mobility Of particular note was hi s tendency to throw to WR Willie Jackson Well see if that continues Sur e hes a long shot but if youre desperate for a QB he could be a nice surprise QB Ryan Leaf SD Hold the presses Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade list Seriously hes an easy target and Ill admit to taking my share of shots but you cant deny the guy has skills Yes there were some fluky plays with Crockett injuring himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw although the TDs on completions did make for a wild looking box scor e for Leaf Hes got some weapons in Jeff Graham Curtis Conway and his bes t receiver TE Freddie Jones Hes as flaky as they come but he might be worth a look if youre dying at QB RBs Moving Up RB Fred Taylor Jac Taylor put together one of the best performances of the year Sunday night The fact that he did it against the very tough rus h defense of the Steelers makes it even all the more impressive This isnt like rolling up yards on the Cowboys or Cardinals Clearly theres reason for huge hope as if he can do this against Pittsburgh he can do it against anyone RB Jamal Lewis Bal Once again Lewis ran hard Hes got to be consider ed one of the better RBs in the game right now I still worry about how durable hell be but hes looked great lately averaging yards per carr y Sunday for yards If it werent for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin g a TD here and there hed be even higher RB Darnell Autry Phi Autry refuses to hand over the RB job to Stanle y Pritchett or anyone else Hes not very flashy but he gets the job done both rushing and receiving The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in the standings and Autry figures to be a large part of that success RB Ahman Green GB Id be a little worried right now if I were Dorsey Levens Green averaged yards per carry Sunday as he rolled up tot al yards Most importantly was his number of fumbles Zero No ones ever doubted his incredible physical skills but now he seems to be bringing th e mental game to go with it RB Mike Anderson Den I hate to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea t impression of Isaac Bruces maddening on again off again season As you know Davis missed another game and once again Anderson stepped in nicely By now you know its tough to predict what Davis is going to do each week so it looks to me as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup RB Jamal Anderson Atl Andersons yards per carry reminded many of h is season Hes running with power and speed and finally appears to be over the knee injury I think hes been over it physically for a while no w but it seems hes handling the mental aspect too WRs Moving Up WR Willie Jackson NO New QB Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson responded well with catches and yards including TDs Often times youll see a backup QB favor the backup WRs as theyre familiar with them Well see if this continues I m guessing Brooks will get comfortable throwing to Joe Horn this week but Jackson is still definitely worth a shot WR Joe Jurevicius NYG As I mentioned above QB Kerry Collins is playing very well With Ike Hilliard set to miss some time Jurevicius should get a chance to show what he can do Hes long been a Fantasy Football tease showing flashes but never really having the opportunity for playing time Lets see what he can do WR Terry Glenn NE Ive beenhigh on Glenn since June He made me look good early on but had cooled midseason Hes now back warming up again an d for you Glenn owners your patience is paying off QB Drew Bledsoe didnt have a TD but he did roll up the yards Once again Glenn was the prime target WR Jimmy Smith Jac Smith looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as the Jags awakened their offenseSunday night Smith seems back in synch with QB Mark Brunell and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game There may not be enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug h for Smith WR James McNight Dal Yes hes a long shot considering the horrid play of Troy Aikman Sunday but you have to like a WR whos getting a ton of looks And McNights getting those looks from Aikman Cant make plays without t he ball TEs Moving Up TE Jay Reimersma Buf Weve been waiting for Reimersma to return to form and he looks to be on his way He was heavily involved and seemed comfortable with new QB Rob Johnson He can be a vital part of the offense and you have to think Johnson will continue to utilize him TE Kris Mangum Car Mangums no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a nice target catches for yards is an improvement from what theyve h ad at TE and it looks like hes back and healthy now Players Moving Down QBs Moving Down QB Steve Beuerlein Car Theres only so much a QB can do by himself He lost Wesley Walls a couple of weeks ago I thought Beuerlein could handle losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur y proved too much His OL is less than stellar and hes just not having muc h time to throw QB Shaun King TB King swings back toward the side of mediocrity after a yard passing effort against Chicago It looked that bad too Even for a Les Steckel Offense Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a positive as teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson QB Steve McNair Ten Not all the turnovers Sunday were

see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Tennessees Eddie George vs Brown Defense Assuming Eddie George can g et his injured toe healthy and I think he can he could have a monster game against a Brown Defense thats been terrible against the rush For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Th e Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the Ravens and I expect George to take out some frustrations on the Browns Miamis Lamar Smith vs Jets Defense Youll have to look awfully ha rd to find a hotter RB than Lamar Smith In their week matchup he ran for TDs and yards At the time it seemed like a fluke but Smith has maintained almost that pace since then Jay Fiedler and the passing game provide just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does the rest Over the last four weeks the Jets rank in rushing yards allowed per game New York Giants Ron Dayne Tiki Barber vs Lion Defense As you know by now the Giants running game is governed by how close they keep the game Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground game especially Ron Daynes role when the Giants start to trail Against a less than explosive Lions team the Giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of th e way Detroits been weak defending the run over the last four weeks wh ere they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Indianapolis Edgerrin James vs Packer Defense Green Bays allowin g yards rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them Jam es should continue to roll this week against a Packer Defense thats missi ng LB Brian Williams whos out with a knee injury DE Vonnie Holiday may be limited but he looks like hell play and thats some concern but I st ill look for James to romp Baltimores Jamal Lewis vs Cowboy Defense The Cowboys gave up their yard rushing days to quick slasher RBs Charlie Garner and Duce Staley but I m guessing power running Jamal Lewis whos almost as quick as those gu ys will be a great play against Dallas For the season Dallas ranks i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Look for him to catch the ball out of the backfield as well Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense San Diegos Terrell Fletcher Jermaine Fazande vs Bronco Defense Ov er the last four week Denver ranks in rushing yards allowed per game This game smells a lot like the Denver Bengal game to me Winless team comes into town with a big power back and nothing to lose We all rememb er Corey Dillons record setting day and many remember Jermaine Fazande s big day rushing in the last game of against the Broncos Terrell Fletcher is working his way into the mix and thats really muddying the waters Keep an eye on this one and if it looks like one of these guys will garner the bulk of the carries he could be worth a flyer Philadelphias Stanley Pritchett Darnell Autry vs Cardinal Defense T he Arizona defense remains pretty weak against the rush They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks For the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB The trick is determining which Eagle RB will get the carries I like Pritchett becaus e hes bigger and can bull doze his way through the Cards Ive been d own on Autry as I believe youre supposed to have the acting careerafter the football career not the other way around Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Eagle Defense Watch this one closely as Pittman is struggling to get healthy with bruised ribs If he can go I like the matchup this week Philadelphia ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Theyre stronger over the ye ar where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Thoma s Jones is in worse shape with pneumonia so Pittman has incentive to get out there Buffalos Sammy Morris Shawn Bryson vs Chief Defense Morris battli ng a bad ankle and looks to be a game time decision Bryson is plenty capable i f he cant go The Chiefs are an attractive matchup as they rank i n rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks They rank i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB for the year Watch this one closely to see if the Bills offer hints to wholl theyll go with Green Bays Ahman Green vs Colt Defense With Dorsey Levens out again Green will be asked to carry the load The Colts are vulnerable to the rus h ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks If Brett Favre can play thatll be a nice boost for Green as the defense wont be able to key on stopping the ground game Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Patriot Defense How much would you rely on Scot Mitchell if you were Dick LeBeau Me neither Whether its Aki li Smith or Scott Mitchell under center its still the Corey Dillon Show New England has shown itself to vulnerable against the rush ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Dillon knows he needs to carry the team and hell do his best His success will depen d on how effect Mitchell can be in drawing the defenses attention toward th e passing game Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way San Franciscos Charlie Garner vs Falcon Defense Charlie Garner continues his great season against a Falcon team thats playing better r ush defense than it had been For the year Atlanta ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB but over the last four weeks they rate in rushing yards allowed per game If theyre without WR Terrell Owe ns again Garner will be asked to carry a little more of the load something h e s gladly done all year Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Jaguar Defense With the WR shuffling go ing on in Pittsburgh I think Bettis is really the only Steeler worthy of starting in most leagues Hes a solid performer though that should h ave another good day grinding the ball out Jacksonville ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they ran k in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Itll be power foo tball as the Steeler just line up and try to run over the Jaguars New Englands JR Redmond Kevin Faulk vs Bengal Defense The Bengal s are tough to predict For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yar ds allowed per game and for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB But they absolutely shut down RB Emmitt Smith last week I look for Redmond and Faulk to have moderate success against this improving unit Redmond is questionable with ribs so keep an eye on this one Chicagos James Allen vs Buccaneer Defense As with the pass defense Tampa Bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing per game For the year they rate in Fantasy Points allowed to th e opposing RBs so its not like theyre invincible With Shane Matthew s behind center and scaring no one though it could be a long day Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Ram Defense As is so often the case th e Redskins could be forced to abandon their running game if the Rams jump out early Washington would dearly love to establish Stephen Davis on the ground but they may not be able to if theyre forced to play catchup The Rams rate over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game For the year they check in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Even with Bud Carson helping coach the defense they can be run upon Atlantas Jamal Anderson vs er Defense Jamal Anderson continues to make solid improvement and he seems close to his form to me Hell face a er Defense that can definitely be run on Over the last four weeks th ey rate in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Not unlike the situation wit h Washington the running backs success largely hinges on the ability of the defense to hang tough Anderson can be taken out of the game if the Falco ns cant hold Jeff Garcia and company down in the passing game Minnesotas Robert Smith vs Panther Defense Ive said for years I d love to see Robert Smith play a full season and now were seeing that could loo k like Hes having a great year and I think hell continue to have s uccess against Carolina Theyve been pretty strong lately against the rush ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks bu t for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB If the Vikings can control Carolinas Steve Beuerlein no small feat itll help Smiths chances immensely Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Jacksonvilles Fred Taylor vs Steeler Defense Fred Taylor is beginnin g to work his way out most Fantasy GMs dog house as he continues to be a br ight spot on a team without many bright spots Hes been running hard but this will be a real gut check for him as he squares off against a very tough Steeler rush defense thats only allowed TDs over the last four games Pittsburgh ranks for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposin g RB and Taylor will have his hands full Carolinas Tshimanga Biakubutuka vs Viking Defense Biakabutuka remain s very questionable with a bad toe and the Panthers dont sound very optimistic about him playing Sunday Keep an eye on it as he was able to play through the pain last week Although it seems to be worse this week than last If he cant go youll see undrafted rookie FB Brad Hoov er get the start Dont ask me how that happens Minnesota is decent against the run ranking over the last four games in rushing yards allowed per gam e and for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Bear Defense Most people including myself thought new offensive coordinator Les Steckel would invol ve Mike Alstott more in Frank Wycheck type roles Hasnt happened yet bu t it ll be interesting to see if they start getting the big guy the balls in creative ways Im sure his fumbling problems are still a huge concern but of course thats not something a guy like Tony Dungy talks very publicl y about The Bears are decent against the run ranking over the last fou r weeks in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they check in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Denvers Terrell Davis vs Charger Defense Davis scared everyone this week when it was reported he had a problem with his calf He says its overblown and was calling it just tightness below the knee He ll need to be as healthy as possible this week as the Chargers have been playing stro ng rush defense of late ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over t he last four weeks For the year theyre still ranked in Fantasy Po ints allowed to the opposing RB reflecting some of their earlier struggles Th e Broncos desperately need Davis to shoulder the load with Brian Griese out and itll be interesting to see how he responds Its a tough matc hup but I bet he does well St Louis Justin Watson vs Redskin Defense The good news for Watson is that he doesnt have to worry about Trung Canidate The bad news is Ro bert Holcomb saw a good bit of work at tailback this week and Marshall Faulk is even making noise about playing Monday Faulk did practice some Thursday but coach Mike Martz still remains pessimistic about him seeing much actio n this week Keep an eye on it as Im sure itll be a top story but r ight now he doesnt look to be a big factor The Redskin rush defense is solid ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game and for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Clevelands Travis Prentice Jamel White vs Titan Defense The Brown s catch Tennessee at an awful time as the Titans are coming off a frustratin g loss at home to Baltimore and will likely be looking to vent some frustrations this week Cleveland looks to bear the brunt of that situation Prentice and White have been unexceptional lately and I don t see them improving against a tough Titan Defense Over the last four weeks Tennessee ranks in rushing yards allowed per game They also ra nk for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB These guy s may do in a pinch on other weeks but I dont see it this Sunday Detroits James Stewart vs Giant Defense Stewart is still a starter i n many leagues but I dont like his matchup here Although you can t discount the time he ran wild on Tampa Bay with an awful matchup too The Giants rank for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB For the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Thats strong Having a healthy Jason Sehorn back will help the entire defense as it allows more safety help to commit to the run Oaklands Napoleon Kaufman vs Saints Defense Keep an eye on it but a t this point Tyrone Wheatley is looking very questionable with not one but t wo bad ankle sprains His most recent sprain is thought to be worse than th e first sprain on the other ankle that was limiting him already Kaufman struggles a bit as the sole RB and Saints are RB Killers For the year th ey rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last fo ur games they check in at in rushing yards allowed per game One ray o f hope for Oakland is that DT Norman Hand is questionable with bone chips in his ankle although they believe he can play even though he hasnt pract iced this week Kansas Citys RB committee vs Bills Defense By now you probably know better than to risk starting any RB wearing a Chief uniform This week s a good week to follow that rule as the Bills are playing excellent rush defense They rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game and the rate for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB I shy away from Chief RBs against any team but especially a defense this tough If you dont have any choice Kimble Anders will g et the start but expect to see plenty of Tony Richardson and Frank Mo reau Richardson in particular does a nice job receiving the ball Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Raven Defense Lets put it this way Smit h was shut down by Cincinnati last week And the Ravens are a just a tad bit better than the Bengals when it comes to run defense If anyone can bounce back its Smith but last Sunday was very worrisome The Ravens are f lying high after a huge road win at Tennessee Hes still a solid RB but Smit h will have his hands more than full Sunday The Ravens rank in rushin g yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and for the year they rate in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Dolphin Defense I dont see a repe at of the week meltdown from Miami on defense Martin will have a tough day ahead of him against the Dolphin defense that ranks over the last fou r weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Over the season they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB The Dolphins were hopeful L B Zach Thomas could return but thats not looking too likely now It ll be even tougher for Martin if he does New Orleans Jerald Moore Chad Morton vs Raider Defense New Orleans catches a tough break as the new RBs are forced to make their first start facing the rush defense in rushing yards allowed per game over the las t four weeks For the year theyre not quite as tough ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB Its tough to call right no w how the carries will be distributed as the Saints are understandably being tight lipped I expect Moore to carry most of the load to begin with Hes the more physical back and much more like Williams than is Morton who falls closer to the scat back rd down guy mold I can envision somethin g similar to the rotation New England is using with JR Redmond and Kevin Faulk For FF purposes youd of course like to see one guy take over but I dont see that now The other wild card is newly signed Terry Allen wh o sounds excited about football again Well see how quickly he can get comfortable To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software f or more info The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position numbers are from ESPNcom Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Raider Defense Gut check time for the Sain ts as they deal with life after Ricky Most folks know Im big on synergy which is just one of those words for depending on your teammates Everyone knows that RBs need a decent passing game to be effective on the ground Im beginning to think however that the effect isnt quite as pronounced in reverse In other words I dont believe losing Ricky Williams will hurt QBJeff Blakeas much as losing Jeff Blake would have hu rt Ricky Williams With RBs Chad Morton andJerald Moorein the backfield I look for Blake to air it out against a suspect Raider pass defense Basically like Donovan McNabb is doing in Philadelphia Over the last weeks Oakland ranks in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB WR Joe Hornis by far the favored target while Keith Pooleand Willie Jacksonmay grab a few TE Andrew Gloveris worth a shot if youre in a bind but hes been very inconsistent Atlanta Passing Game vs er Defense The er defense squashed Elvis Grbac owners last week but Im not quite ready to appoint them QB Killer s Theyve been awful for the year up until then Over the last four week s they rank in passing yards allowed per game And they rank for t he year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB QB Chris Chandleris back among us now and the cobwebs seem to be cleared WR Terrance Mathisis by far the best receiving choice although its worth noting th at Shawn Jeffersonhad a great game against this er team back in week doesnt that seem like a long time ago TE Reggie Kellycould be wor th a long shot as the ers rank in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing TEs although Kelly has done very little of late Minnesota Passing Game vs Panther Defense Im running out of adject ives to describe the stellar play of QB Daunte Culpepper And I think hell keep it rolling this week against a Carolina team that ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Culpepper creates some matchup problems I dont think the Panthers can solve Of course he ll be throwing to the best WR tandem in the game and that never hurts Both Randy Moss and Cris Carterare sure starters in any league Both have a great chance every week of exploding Id even consider WR Matthe w Hatchetteif youre in the gambling mood in a very large league The T Es arent much of a factor here and when they are the receptions are spre ad around Washington Passing Game vs Ram Defense Jeff Georgegets another start i n place of the injured Brad Johnson after a less than earth shaking performance in week vs Arizona yards TD interceptions Fortunately he gets to face a St Louis pass defense thats still givi ng up lots of yards even with Bud Carson helping out They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks And for the year they ra nk in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB As much as the Redski ns would like to control the game with RBStephen Davis you just have to think theyll be forced to throw in order to keep pace with the Rams A bye week should help things WR Albert Connellhas been the source of great frustration for many Fantasy GMs but this should be a good week for him James Thrashis covering the WR job and he might be a good roll of the dice as well TE Stephen Alexanderdoesnt seem to produce the numbers you d think he would in this offense partly because FB Larry Centerscatches so many short passes that might have gone to the TE Carolina Passing Game vs Viking Defense Im looking for a uptick from QB Steve Beuerleinin this one Call it a hunch as he does have some negative s going his way with injuries to his supporting cast RB Tshimanga Biakabutukais iffy FB William Floydis out and center Frank Garcia abrasion to his eye and offensive lineman Matt Campbell thigh contusion also were injured during the New Orleans loss Coach George Seifert is hopeful both can go Sunday On the plus side hes got two physical W Rs in Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad that could give the vulnerable Viking CBs trouble He should have more time to throw this week against a Viking defense thats only recorded sacks in the last games For the year Minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game The TE situatio n is still shaking itself out as Kris Mangum looks to be healthy Only thin g for certain is no one has really stepped in to fill the Wesley Walls void Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Green Bay Passing Game vs Colts Defense First off this assumes Brett Favrecan get healthy If he can I like the matchup against a Colt team that seems to play just good enough to win For the year they rank i n passing yards allowed per game It should be noted theyve played be tter lately though ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Indy seems to jump out early and force the other team to pl ay catchup which they often come close to doing Favres struggled with his RBs his WRs and his own health but this could be a game he surprises He s kind of a storybook guy and this would be a great chapter in the b ook Well see RB Ahman Greengets the start but he must get his fumbling under control WR Antonio Freemanis a likely starter in your league although so rt of like Favre he hasnt produced like many thought he would Bill Schroedercovers the WR and he often sees more passes thrown his way than does Freeman Bubba Franksis coming on at TE and could be a nice play Buffalo Passing Game vs Chief Defense Most folks know Im not a big Rob Johnsonfan but hes got a good matchup this week against a KC defense th ats been awful defending the pass Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB although theres a chance DE Eric Hick s will be back this week after missing time with a bad knee and that will he lp the pass rush he didnt practice Wednesday though Johnson will be throwing to one of the games best WRs in Eric Moulds Not only is Mould s ultra talented but he draws by far the most targets on his team Sharing is great for kids but you like for your Fantasy WRs to be ball hogs Peerless Priceand Jeremy McDanielpick up the scraps RB Sammy Morrisis hobbled so watch that as hes a solid receiver as well TE Jay Reimers mahas been a real disappointment lately although the Chiefs are awful against TEs where they rank just in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE Miami Passing Game vs Jets Defense I dont know if this will be anot her shootout like they had in their matchup earlier this season but the potential for the Dolphins to score some points is definitely there The Jets rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks QB Jay Fiedlershould have plenty of options available as the Dolphins are finally getting WRs healthy Leslie Shepherdand Oronde Gadsdenhave bee n playing well but Tony Martinand OJ McDuffieare now in the mix Hes probably the least physical of the bunch but Ive got a pretty good fee ling for Shepherd here even though he may not start with Martin healthy The smashing success of Lamar Smith is carrying this offense so dont look for too much through the air for Miami Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense QB Shaun Kinglooks to continue t he roll against a Bear team that doesnt know which way its headed T he Bears are decent defending the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per ga me over the last four weeks but for the year they rank in Fantasy Point s allowed to the opposing QB Kings playing with confidence and will l ikely keep focusing on getting the ball to Keyshawn Johnson something I learned from Sporting News Dan Pompei this week about Johnsons num ber As you probably know Receivers have to wear numbers in the s As a Je t rookie all the s were taken so they allowed him to have It wa s such a hit with the fans and NFL Properties chaching that even when a number in the s came available the league granted Johnson an except ion to keep It is a cool number for a WR Ill admit This week Johnso n should continue to have success against a suspect Bear Secondary Jacquez Greenhas really dropped off with Kings new found attraction for Keyshaw n wasnt going near Johnson in that sentence RB Warrick Dunnis a nice threat catching the ball and TE Dave Mooreis a steady performer Philadelphia Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Arizonas offense is in shambles with injuries all around The trouble is these guys werent very good to start with now theyre hurt too What this means is that the Eagles could see lots of offensive action this week if the Cardinals can t do anything when they have the ball Arizona ranks over the last fo ur weeks in passing yards allowed per game But that number will probably worsen if QB Donovan McNabbkeeps throwing the ball times a game as he d id Sunday Philadelphia may be struggling to find a running game but they re making up for it through the air Aeneas Williams is a tough cornerback b ut he cant cover everyone Torrance Smalland Charles Johnsonshould see plenty of action RB Stanley Pritchettcatches the ball very well and I keep thinking TE Chad Lewiswill break out of his slump Indianapolis Passing Game vs Packer Defense Green Bays been pretty t ough of late ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks but for the year they come in at in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Peyton Manningsnot a guy wholl go wild for you in the stat column but I like this matchup The Packers have a couple of defensive players either hobbled or out and Manning should have time to throw Thats dangerous WRMarvin Harrisondraws the majority of passe s from Manning and thats just the way we like it Jerome Pathonseems t o have taken the job away from Terrence Wilkins Both Marcus Pollardan d Ken Dilgerare solid TEs and Id feel ok starting either in leagues that required one Of course RB Edgerrin Jamesis a huge asset catching the ba ll out of the backfield Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way New England Passing Game vs Bengal Defense The Bengals are playing harde r for new coach Dick LeBeau but their pass defense and secondary is still fairly porous Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Although for the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB This week the health of Drew Bledsoes ri ght thumb is on everyones mind He says hell play and is calling it not an issue Well see Troy Aikman hobbled onto the field last week a nd lit this Bengal team up If Bledsoes healthy he could do even better T erry Glenn and Troy Brown are the prime guys with Glenn still the main target He showed an upswing last week after a few worrisome games He just sign ed a nice contract so lets see if he can start earning it TE Eric Bjor nson fell quickly He was starting a few weeks ago and now hes unemployed Rod Rutledge is the new TE and would be a great pickup if hes available He caught passes last week including a TD Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense Its hard to get too excite d about Kordell Stewartthrowing the ball but this is a decent matchup for him Jacksonville ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Last week they let Seattle roll up the yards and Jon Kitna is hardly Peyton Manning WRs Hines Ward andCourtney Hawkinsare the new starting W R tandem and itll be interesting to see if benching st round underachiev er Plaxico Burressmakes any difference Truthfully youre reaching if y oure digging down for these guys though RB Jerome Bettisis the only viable starter on this offense unless youre in a really big league New York Jets Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense After the Indy loss last week coach Al Groh was giving votes of confidence to Vinny Testeverde Thats usually not a good sign But remember the last time these teams met Vinny went wild with yards passing and TDs Miami recovered nicely from that meltdown and has only allowed TDs in the last games The Dolphins boast two of the best corners in the game in Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain Madison can shut anyone down and Wayne Chrebetwill have his hands full although he had a great game in the first matchup Dedri c Wardis the WR but I like the rookie Laveranues Colesto do some nice things here Worth a shot maybe if youre strapped for WRs Miami has enough faith in theirCBs that they often leave them on the island in man coverage which can lead to a big play TE Anthony Bechtis showing some nice flashes Like Green Bays Bubba Franks it took a little while to get these big guys going Kansas City Passing Game vs Bill Defense Im guessing QB Elvis Grbaccomes out of the chute firing The Chiefs desperately need this game and its clear to see that Grbac winging the football gives this team t he best chance of winning The Bills play a solid pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and ranking i n Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year TE Tony Gonzalezremains the focal point of the offense although the Bills rank in the league in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year WRs Derrick Alexanderand Sylvester Morrismake a solid tandem and RB Tony Richardsondoes a nice job receiving out of the backfield although you never know what coach Gunther Cunningham will do with his RBs San Diego Passing Game vs Bronco Defense Remember that the Bengals spanked this Denver team so anything can happen This time of year I ge t a fair amount of email from owners with great rosterswho have to decide between QBs like Peyton Manning or Daunte Culpepper Thats great Think about poor Mike Rileyhes got to decide between Jim Harbaughand Ry an Leaf Harbaugh said hes ready to go and is calling his injury a mild hernia He was named the starter early in the week But with Rileys r ock solid management style hes now starting Leaf Im not sure it re ally matters TE Freddie Jonesis the only viable starter on that team but he s pretty darn good ranking in my TD Performance league over the last three weeks Denver ranks just in in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year so he could do some damage here Both QBs will throw to him so it really doesnt matter who gets the nod WRs Curti s Conwayand Jeff Grahamare too inconsistent to get excited about Oakland Passing Game vs Saints Defense Both these teams took a beating last week with the Raiders losing a heartbreaker to Denver and the Saints losing their star RB Ricky Williamsto a broken ankle The Saints have actually been pretty weak on pass defense lately ranking in passing yards allowed per game They are better for the year where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Itll be interesting Q B Rich Gannon will be scrambling and improvising as usual WR Tim Brownis the primary target but James Jettand Andre Risonwill see some action as well Hes up and down but TE Ricky Dudleymight have a chance as New Orleans ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year RB Tyrone Wheatleyis looking very questionable for this week with two sprained ankles which will probably force Gannon to throw more St Louis Passing Game vs Redskin Defense We see it every year it seem s yet so many teams fail to heed the wisdom of acquiring a solid backup QB Both real NFL teams and Fantasy teams need one to be successful Kurt Warner is getting antsy on the sidelines so you know QB Trent Greenwants to shine for another game or two before turning the keys to the car back over Make no mistake Green wants to win for the Rams but he knows hes play ing for a contract Green will be a starter somewhere in and with every TD his negotiating power is strengthened He should fare well even though Washington is a tough defense Partly due to the loss of RB Marshall Faulkwhere Green will likely be forced to the air often as if he needs a reason to pass Faulk made a bit of noise about returning for this g ame and he did practice some Thursday Even if he does play its hard to envision him as a real factor The trouble with St Louis is picking the WR s that will score each week Isaac Bruceand Torry Holtare the two best choices but AzZahir Hakimand Ricky Proehlare not bad options either An d just for good measure TE Roland Williamshas been effective Washington s secondary featuring Deion Sanders Champ Bailey and Darrell Green are a superb unit but theyll have their hands full with St Louis Baltimore Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Dallas shut down the Bengal passing game last week Now thats something to be proud of This week theyll face a rejuvenated Baltimore passing game thats flying high QB Trent Dilferis doing a great Tony Banks impression as coach Brian Billick breathes life into another troubled career His primary target i s TE Shannon Sharpeand I dont think that will change for this week Dal las only ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE so he could blow up For opposing QBs Dallas ranks in Fantasy Points allowed pe r game for the year WRs Qadry Ismailand Patrick Johnsonare decent plays a s well against a secondary that will be without Cheatsheetsnet honorary captain enforcer George Teague whos gone for the year That will be a factor as Teagues a leader on the fieldStill though as poor as the Cowb oy run defense has been youd have to think the Ravens will focus on runn ing the ball with Jamal Lewis Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Chicago Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Lets put it this way T ampa Bay held the Packers to yards passing last week Shane Matthews wil l start for the Bears Ive seen Shane Matthews play and hes no Bre tt Favre Hes not even a Matt Hasselbeck The Bears are in shambles lo sing another gameto Buffalo and losing another starting QB to injury Offensi ve Coordinator Gary Crowton is rumored to be headed to Brigham Young and many fans arent sad to see him talk about going In fact some wish he d stop talking about and just go already This could get ugly for Matthews Although it should be noted the Bucs have a tougher reputation than thei r numbers would support Over the last four weeks they rank just in passing yards allowed per game They rank in in Fantasy Points allow ed to the opposing QB for year Solid numbers but not quite as dominating a s Warren Sapp would have you believe Still though Id shy away from mos t all the Bears this week Id maybe roll the dice on Marcus Robinsoni f you needed a WR but its sketchy at best In fact Matthews seemed to loc k in on Eddie Kennisonlast week instead of Robinson when he was thrust into action Whether this is a real tendency remains to be seen but Id be hesitant to bank on any of these guys too heavily this week Detroit Passing Game vs Giant Defense I have never liked Charlie Batch I think it stems from the fact he looks like Otis Sistrunk but bottom line is Ive never been comfortable with the guy Im getting less comfo rtable with each week it seems Sunday Batch faces a tough Giants defense that has CB Jason Sehorn back They rank over the past four weeks in passing yards allowed per game Sehorn and CB Dave Thomas are both big players who give up very little physically to WRs Johnnie Morton andHerma n Moore Moore seems to be finally waking up Hell likely face Thomas who s not nearly as good as Sehorn TE David Sloanhas a shot as the Giants rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year but ke ep an eye on him as hes questionable hamstring back New York Giant Passing Game vs Lion Defense Detroit may be struggling to throw the ball but theyre doing a pretty good job defending the pass They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks I like QB Kerry Collinsbut hell need some healthy receivers to do anyth ing Ike Hilliardis good to go but both Amani Toomerand Joe Jureviciuswere talking gibberish on the sidelines Sunday after suffering concussions Bo th seem likely to play but you have to wonder how effective theyll be The Lions are much more vulnerable against the run so its conceivable the Giants could go with heavy doses of RBs Ron Daynewith some Tiki Barbermixed in for this one San Francisco Passing Game vs Falcon Defense Im still a huge Jeff G arcia backer but Im not too high on this matchup vs the Falcons Especially with WR Terrell Owenslooking less likely to play as the week progresses The good news is that Jerry Ricelooks to be ok for Sunday Atlanta ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so theyre solid The secondary ranks nd in the league with interceptions They re not as tough for the year though where they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Atlanta has sacks in the last games so theyre getting decent pressure on the QB The key as I see it will be developing the running game with Charlie Garner Hes having a great y ear running and receiving the ball Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Cleveland Passing Game vs Titan Defense The worst thing that could hav e happened to the Browns was for the Ravens to spoil the Titans perfect record at home last week Im betting you see a fired up defense this week that could spell doom for QB Doug Pedersonand the Browns Tennessee ran ks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year Pederson s been painful to watch and it wont be any prettier this week WRs Kev in Johnsonand Dennis Northcuttwill see most of the work but Id have a t ough time feeling very good about starting either In fact you can pretty much just skip the Cleveland team this week Cincinnati Passing Game vs Patriot Defense I doubt youre still interested in Fantasy Football in week if you have many Bengals on your roster Heres all you need to know Scott Mitchellvs Bill Belichic k Belichick may have his faults but hes the master at confusing a QB It could get ugly On the flip side theres always that shred of hope Mitchell returns to his form and lights it up But I kinda doubt it Outside of Corey Dillon WR Peter Warrickis the only other possible FF starter on offense Warricks always worth a roll of the dice just for his big play potential Arizona Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This is almost unfair The Cardinals are already one of the worst teams in the league Now they hav e to deal with Center Mike Gruttadauria is done for the year WRs David Bostons hamstring is worse than it was last week when it was bad and Frank Sanders has a serious knee bruise RB Michael Pittmans ribs ar e killing him and Thomas Jones has walking pneumonia Good grief If someone goes to jail and has their wife leave them itll be a Country Western song Unless youre desperate Id avoid all the Cardinal s this week against just about any team Much less the Eagles who are playing very good defense right now Jacksonville Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The above three offenses Cleveland Cincinnati and Arizona make the Slam Dunk list because the offenses are awful The Jags are struggling with injuries still but they land here because the Steelers are playing excellent defense Pittsburgh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year Remember it was against the Steelers when QB Mark Brunell was benched for Jamie Martin back in week Brunell will throw to WR Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell but Im not looking for a lot from either guy The ga me is in Pittsburgh at night and thats a long ways from Jacksonville both in miles and more importantly temperature TE Kyle Brady has calmed down since Jimmy Smith is back healthy although hes a decent play against a tough defense Dallas Passing Game vsRaven Defense Troy Aikman will find the going tougher this week against a fired up Raven team than he did against the Bengals last week Baltimore ranks for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Over the last four games they rate in passing yards allowed per game Aikman will look for James McNight and Jason Tucker man that sounds weird but dont expect the same success you saw last week from these guys In case you were wondering Baltimore is also ranked in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year so Jackie Harris and David LaFluer dont look good either Tennessee Passing Game vsBrown Defense One of the cornerstone principles of Fantasy Football is you have to understand that the numbers rule It s easy to look at the Browns and dismiss them as awful but in certain areas such as pass defense theyre very good in the numbers department For the year Cleveland ranks in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Over the last four games they rank in passing yards allowed per game The reasons for doing so are different but theyre putting up pass defe nse numbers very similar to what the Ravens are posting In Clevelands c ase teams are choosing to run the ball against their vulnerable rush defense Why risk a pass when the defense is begging to be run over QB Steve McNa ir will be looking to WRs Derrick Mason and Chris Sanders Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen could play but youve been burned enough by these guys already TE Frank Wycheck is still the primary receiver although McNair i s spreading the ball around a little more Denver Passing Game vs Charger Defense After a few weeks of flailing about the Chargers are back at the top of the defensive rankings Over th e last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game where th ey faced Miami Seattle and Oakland Granted thats not like shutting dow n St Louis but holding those teams to an average of yards passing per ga me is strong Theyll be facing new QB Gus Frerotte wholl likely tak e a bit to get settled WRs Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith are both solid Denver s still using the TE set with Desmond Clark Dwayne Carswell and Byron Chamberlain all producing I like all the Broncos and I can see them starting in many leagues Im just not too happy about the matchup this week To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEAccording to the Associated Press out of sheer habit Terry Robisk ie almost forgot he was in charge during his first practice as interim coach of the Washington Redskins In fact the man really in charge wasnt there at all Dan Snyder was attending league meetings in New York and wasnt sitting in his usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday If he had been there th e owner would have seen Robiskie do a doubletake to keep from following the same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers under fired coach Norv Turner Today the whistle blew and I started going out with my receivers Robisk ie said And I realized I couldnt I had to go out and stand in the middle of the field and do whatever it is Norvs been out there doing And what did Robiskie do in the middle of the field I did what I usually do Robiskie said with a shrug Talking Robiskie made some changes He eliminated the morning walkthrough so players can rest their legs He simplified the offensive scheme He spent more time on special teams in part because new special teams coach Pat Flaherty is also trying to nail down a new routine Robiskie also said hell have the last word once the whistle blows and t he game begins Otherwise he made it clear that Snyder is the boss A lot of people want to separate us from Mr Snyder Robiskie said Mr Snyder owns the football team I know that I promise you theres very few things in the building Im going to say I want to change without calling h im to say I want to change it The subject arose when earlier in the day when disgruntled quarterback Bra d Johnson said Snyder not Robiskie made the decision to start Jeff George the rest of the season I think that decisions made from up top I think its obvious Johnson said I think Jeffs going to be the starter the rest of the way out In case something happens with him then Ill be ready to go Otherwise Im just going to finish strong up here and deal with my situation in the offseason Robiskie said the decision to go with George was a collective one made by the coaches and Snyder Turner had planned to go with George for this week s game against Dallas Turner was fired Monday a day after a loss to th e New York Giants If I wanted to change my desk Im going to call him and say I want to change my desk Robiskie said If I want to change quarterbacks Im goi ng to call him and say What do you think of me changing quarterbacks Its his football team To try to separate it were wasting our time Snyder was not available for comment His spokesman Karl Swanson said Robiskie makes all football decisions just as Norv did He doesnt need to ask anybodys permission Still Robiskies remarks might make it even harder for the Redskins to lu re a highprofile coach for next season One thing is for sure The quarterba ck who led them to their only playoff appearance since does not plan to return Johnsons relationship with Snyder has been frosty since the owner signed George to a huge contract in the spring and refused to negotiate a new one for Johnson While Turner preferred Johnson George was Snyders chosen catch Johnsons contract expires at the end of the season and he restated his intention to become a free agent I still stand by what I want to do Johnson said We tried to work out stuff a long time ago and it didnt work out on both sides And youve go t to move on The only way the Redskins can keep Johnson from becoming a free agent woul d be to designate him as a franchise player but that would require an upfro nt commitment of about million from a team with almost no salary cap room Johnsons career record as a starter is Georges is Johnson said he would not mind working with Turner again I wouldnt have a problem strapping it up with him again at all under different circumstances Johnson said Norvs a tremendous coach Hes going to go one way and Im going to go another way and you never know where that road leads in the end lSAINTS PK BRIEN ON THIN ICE IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEAccording to Ted Lewis of the New Orleans TimesPicayune this should be a happy time for Saints kicker Doug Brien For the first time since he was a rookie with the eventual Super Bowl champion ers in hes on a team that is zeroing in on a playoff berth But as so often happens to those playing the most precarious position on the team theres a little dark cloud on the horizon Unhappy with Briens misses of fieldgoal attempts in three of his last four games the Saints brought in freeagent kickers Michael Husted and Doug Pelfrey for workouts Tuesday although neither was signed First of all we wanted to see whos out there special teams coach Al Everest said And I would hope it makes Doug aware that he has a responsibility to the team and to himself and that security in this business is success Its the first time in Briens six seasons with the Saints that his job appeared anything less than secure But the working out of Husted and Pelfrey doesnt have him looking over his shoulder any more than he has in the past I was plenty motivated before said Brien who was told about the workouts by Everest on Monday So it doesnt increase my motivation And it doesnt affect my concentration either Theres always a long li ne of guys out there whether theyre here working out or in camp If you dont perform to a certain standard thats what happens By Brien standards he is not having a good year The fifth mostaccurate kicker in league history coming into the season percent is of The six misses are Briens most since when he was of in si x games with the ers and of in eight games with the Saints Since th en the most he has missed has been five Brien the numbertwo kicker from beyond yards in league history befor e this season has been allowed to try only two from that distance a nd both were blocked Ive been struggling a little bit said Brien who took extra kicks in practice Wednesday I havent been hitting the ball as well as I normally do Its very frustrating but at the same time the law of averages plays i n Ive been pretty consistent over the last five years here and I wouldnt say Im doing horribly I just expect to do better and the Saints expect me to be better Its not so much how many kicks Brien has missed but when he has missed them At St Louis he was wide right on a yarder with left that would have given the Saints a point lead Instead they had to sweat out two more possessions by the Rams that could have tied the score And last week against Denver he was wide left on a yarder in the firs t quarter that would have given the Saints the early lead Never mind that h e made three more after that That miss had Saints coach Jim Haslett visibly unhappy on the sideline last Sunday and again on Monday It wasnt the hold Haslett said then It wasnt the snap It wasnt protection He just missed it and it would have been nice to have had those three points But Wednesday Haslett took the unusual step of sitting with Brien at his locker for several minutes after practice engaging in what appeared to be lighthearted encouragement I have confidence in Doug Haslett said I cant get inside kickers heads but Doug will fight through this and everything will be fine Everybody goes through this in a point in their career Maybe so but kickers and punters are the only frontline players who can be replaced on a moments notice even this late in the season Right now kicking field goals and extra points is all Doug does since o ur kickoff guy is Toby Gowin Everest said But we havent seen anybody yet we think is better than Doug To be sure the Saints will bring in two more kickers next Tuesday Jeff Hall and Scott Blanton And to Brien who likes to think of each kick being of equal value no matter the distance or the situation it is a time to strive to do better Ive been pressing a little too much and trying to make things happen he said Im not way far off but it doesnt take too much I dont think Ive ever missed a kick at the end of a game thats cost t he team a game and I dont intend to start now Im doing what I can to get this fixed and just keep plugging along Also of interest ESPNs John Clayton reported that Terry Allen will probably get the start at halfback for the Saints because of the neck injury to Jerald Moore and the sore shoulder of Chad Morton Morton may play on his shoulder but Moore who has had three recent neck stingers probably wont However neither man was included on Fridays list of early inactives Ric ky Williams and Jake Reed were the only offensive skill players on that list As stated in USA Today WR Joe Horn had catches for yards against the Niners the last time the two teams met the thirdbest receiving yards game in club history He needs nine receptions to break the Saints singleseason record for catches in one year Eric Martin holds the team record of Last week Horn became only the fifth receiver in club histo ry to gain receiving yards Martin did it three times According to Pro Football Weekly the first person among a throng of wellwishers to meet Saints QB Aaron Brooks when he got off the plane following the Saints huge Week win in St Louis was an absolutely exuberant Jeff Blake While the Saints injured starting QB didnt travel with the team to the Rams game Blake continues to make his presence felt in a very highprofile and positive manner And finally PFW also advised against becoming too excited Hasletts announcement last week that Williams who underwent ankle surgery November is ahead of schedule in his rehab and could return for the teams regularseason finale vs the Rams Williams was expected to have the cast on his ankle removed late last week But Haslett has a tendency to be overly optimistic in his estimations on his players projected returns following injuries this season and it s hardly a lock Williams will be ready to rumble before a possible appearanc e in the playoffs if even then The report went on to say that while Williams has supposedly been diligently working out at team headquarters riding an exercise bike and lifting weights he has kept an extremely low profile making it hard for sources outside the organization to get a good read on his actual progress MCGINNIS NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PLUMMER IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGETim Tyers of the Arizona Republic reported this morning that Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummers injured ribs didnt allow him to practice on Friday and whether he plays on Sunday at Jacksonville will be determined by a dreaded gameday decision according to head coach Dave McGinnis He hasnt been able to practice for two days and thats not a good sign McGinnis said If hes not ready to go theres no reason to play him I m not going to risk him It makes no sense If Plummer cant go numbertwo quarterback Dave Brown who is still experiencing soreness in the left shoulder he injured in his only start t wo weeks ago against the New York Giants will start But McGinnis also guaranteed that if Brown does start numberthree man Chris Greisen will see extensive action Its the first Ive heard of it Greisen I have to be ready either way Dave will start but he still has that shoulder problem Its not really a problem its a nuisance and I know its hurting him a little bit but he can still play quarterback at a high level I just have to be ready Also of interest McGinnis said he will take three running backs with the team to Jacksonville Michael Pittman hyperextended big toe saw limited duty on Friday but will be available Backup Thomas Jones assumed a larger practice role this week but Clarence Williams is going for added insurance Thomas has been fine the last two days He seems to be getting a lot better McGinnis said And finally The Cardinals released tight end Derek Brown on Monday lNINERS OWENS MISSES FRIDAYS PRACTICE IMAGEWritten By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris Posted Saturday December PTIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ESPN NFL insider John Clayton reports that San Francisco wide receiver Terrell Owens didnt practice Friday but that doesnt mean he wont play He had a better week on his turf toe and he may start Sunday against the Saints Running back Garrison Hearst was the only player of interest included on yesterdays list of early inactives Other items of interest Quarterback Jeff Garcia who is ranked third in the latest results of fan balloting for the Pro Bowl would welcome a ticket to Honolulu for the February game If Im able to be selected to represent this team in the Pro Bowl Id definitely be honored and I think it just shows people Ive turned a long way said Garcia who threw for yards and two touchdowns Sunday ers

Denver QB Brian Griese made my Downgrade list in the Upgrades Downgrade article According to John Clayton of ESPN Grieses shoulder injury is a separation of the AC joint in his right clavicle He took a pain killing shot and finished the game Unfortunately his status for this weeks game against San Diego is in doubt At this point coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will be a couple of days before they decide what theyre doing Ive copied the entire story below if youd like more details Sounds like this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket because he could hear the crowd hold its breath is classic Ill keep an eye on it for you as this shakes out Joe From the article nflnewshtml DENVER Brian Griese had a secret Mike Shanahan knew because he was the head coach Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of his right shoulder His teammates didnt know what went on behind closed doors in Mondays dramatic Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium All his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an illadvised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasnt missed The Raiders had an play fieldgoal drive that lasted six minutes Teammates saw Griese trot back to the field warm up and miss only five plays They didnt hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and needed a paindeadening shot to finish the final three quarters This is not a game I wanted to miss and I was going to do anything possible to get in the game and help my team win Griese said I was going to do it It was just the will to play and the will to win and I wasnt going to come out An hour after the game Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran their huddle had a busted wing His performance was John Elwaylike for courage but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese available as a starting quarterback for Sundays game against the San Diego Chargers We wont know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury but hes such a competitor Shanahan said Hes been like that since hes been here He wants to play and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure he doesnt further hurt himself Thats the kind of guy he is Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy Last year was different In the preseason it was supposed to be Bubby Bristers team but Shanahan named Griese the starter Veterans didnt feel totally comfortable with him Griese didnt feel comfortable bossing around a group of players who didnt take to him Brians the one to lead us Smith said I think it would have hurt him more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing with the shoulder the way it was Whatever he does he doesnt surprise me Hes the best quarterback in the NFL I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon is We think Brian is Griese told his offensive players that he didnt have too much zip on the ball They accepted it as just humility I wasnt throwing the ball as well I have been Griese said Some of the balls just died At that point it was just your will to play your will to win I wasnt coming out of the game Griese was of for yards with a separated shoulder Hed throw passes and hear as well as feel his shoulder popping in and out I knew there was something wrong with it but they assured me that I couldnt do any further damage Griese said It was just whether I could handle the pain Being injured didnt make Griese shy away from contact Several times he took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High Stadium grass Once cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the blindside Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high Believe it or not the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I heard the crowd and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that Griese said I said to myself Well somebody must be ready to hit me Talk about homefield advantage Griese has never had an injury like this He has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that requires surgery but this was much more painful Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big play He had to make just an armthrough pass It was agonizing He threw a skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the chin I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I didnt have any zip on the ball Griese said Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different We knew it was something that was hurting him we knew he was banged up fullback Howard Griffith said Thats how it is when youve got a job to do Still the story told after the game amazed them To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

rades Replacing Ricky Williams Contrary to published reports Ricky Williams bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to ESPN The wor d is that Jim Haslett will likely not go outside the team for a back Chad Morton and Jerald Moore will likely be the choices with Morton getting fir st shot Mortons a little undersized at and but so is Sa n Franciscos Charlie Garner and he manages pretty wellMorton came from a big time program at USC and averaged carries a game last year so it s not like he isnt used to carrying the load Well see Dont Count Out Brett Favre According to ESPN Brett Favres foot is much better and he may practice this week Even if he doesnt practice he thinks he may be able to play and keep his record streak of consecutive starts intact Akili Smith Benched Not just benched Benched for Scott Mitchell Tha t s gotta hurt Marshall Faulk Raring to Go With Trung Canidate out for the year with a broken wrist Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may be abl e to play this week Most think thats too optimistic but its nice t o see the desire there Jeff George to StartAccording to the Redskins Jeff George will start again this week at QB Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is BradJohnsons when heshealthy possibly inweek Lets jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players As we head dow n the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines A s we head into our th week of listing these players its inevitable th at some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list Make sure you understand what were talking about is players that are moving I n other words a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis t and still be good enough to be a starter in your league It just means I m concerned about the way he seems to be heading Likewise a player like WR Laveranues Coles may make the upgrade list even though hes still fairl y far down the list of WRs Its all about which direction players are movi ng Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference Joe Upgrades and Downgrades Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some arent as clear Heres my list of guys I see moving this week QBs Moving Up QB Mark Brunell Jac Im one of those guys who quickly points out Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he receives but you cant deny what Brunell has done lately Behind a beat up line hes standing in there while taking a beating and delivering th e ball Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and paired with Keenan McCardel l theyre one of the better WR tandems in the league QB Kerry Collins NYG A few weeks ago I took some deserved lumps for my early praise of Collins but hes kicking his game up a notch of late He looks more comfortable in the pocket especially in his footwork and drop backs Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing but when hes healthy T oomer and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps Asolid ground game in Ron Dayne a nd Tiki Barber continue to help the passing game QB Donovan McNabb Phi With Deuce Staley gone McNabbs had to shoul der the offense and this week he came through with flying colors The bad ne ws is he only completed of his passes Sunday The good news is he threw t he ball times When a QB airs it out times in one game it doesnt usually bode well for the teams chances of winning but its certain ly a plus for your FF team to see that many attempts With that many chances its like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake attempt s this week or Jeff Garcia attempts puts up Unless you have a really good feeling about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry Id think you ll see him continue to throw often QB Trent Dilfer Bal Remember this list is relative While he may no t be a starter Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and thats what this list is all about He actually looked very good at times in the huge victory over Tennessee Sunday He showed nice poise coming back after basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier Brian Billick did wonders with a marginally talented Tony Banks in and its conceiva ble he might do it here again with Dilfer They play Dallas and Cleveland ne xt but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December QB Troy Aikman Dal When Im bashing Mark Brunell as a Fantasy QB I usually compare him to Troy Aikman Great real NFL QB but not a much f or Fantasy GMs Notice a pattern here After being named the starter Sunda y Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked over t he last weeks Its hard to put too much faith in him but if youre desperate for a QB he could be worth a gamble Tough matchup this week vs Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week QB Jeff Blake NO You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is gone for weeks I hate it for Williams owners Im one but what s done is done All we can do now is look forward And looking forward I see Blake being forced to carry an increased load QB Donovan McNabb threw t he ball times Sunday in the wake of losing RB Deuce Staley and I could easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with Blake throwing a l ot more passes QB Rob Johnson Buf I make it a point to hold my tongue on coaching issues but Ive gotta say I think Mr Charisma with the Spiffy Sweaters Wade Phillips is wrong in going to Johnson In terms of roster management hes hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion But no ne of that really matters as Rob Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he s been named the starter for this week Dont get too excited though Johnson finishes roughly half the games he starts and the next three weeks vs Kansas City Tampa Bay and Miami could be brutal QB Matt Hasselbeck GB Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre this week Remember there was even some talk about trading Favre and starting Hasselbeck this summer when Favres elbow was a big concern Before yo u give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck you should know Brett Favre is reportedly feeling better and hoping to play this week Well keep you posted QB Shane Matthews Cade McNown Chi Again Im highlighting guys mov ing up With the injury to Jim Miller Shane Matthews will be thrust into the starting role The injury will also likely add a little fire under Cade McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have been if Miller was performing well Matthews looked very rusty but its tough to judge a QB when hes thrust into the game like that Id look for Matthews at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then well see RBs Moving Up RB Lamar Smith Mia You have to keep giving this guy his props after another great game Although if youve got an owner salivating over S mith and you can get a lot in return it might be a great time to trade him I cant imagine his value being any higher His yard per carry number d ipped to in Sundays game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal matchup against Tampa Bay in week RB Edgerrin James Ind Its tough to upgrade a guy already near the top but he put in another great game Sunday with total yards and shows little sign of slowing down He averaged yards per carry Sunday and the Colts are leaning heavily on him Watch out for a tough November matchup vs Miami though RB Robert Smith Min Smith quietly is having an incredible year He s put those hang nail injury jokes way behind him as hes become one of t he best RBs in the league Hes running between the tackles for the toug h yards and catching the ball exceptionally well Keep an eye on that tasty week matchup against the Cowboys RB Fred Taylor Jac Jaguar Fans may be distraught but Fred Taylor owne rs have to be happy at least lately Taylors running as well as he has i n his career even if his team is struggling One can only wonder what he d be doing with a healthy supporting cast Hes got two tough weeks coming against Pittsburgh and Tennessee But as everyone knows Taylor has a gre at stretch run of opponents in weeks when he faces Cleveland Arizona a nd Cincinnati RB Jamal Anderson Atl If you didnt know better you might have tho ught you were watching tape from if you saw Anderson Sunday He ran hard a nd with the power and quickness that pushed him to stardom Hopefully he ll be able to maintain that form RB Michael Pittman Ari Pittmans nursing a chest rib injury so ke ep an eye on that but assuming hes ok he has to make the upgrade list He scored a TD Sunday and averaged yards per carry on carries He als o added receptions His main competition for carries Thomas Jones had a yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday RB Justin Watson StL Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed for yards on carries He likely wont be a factor long as Marshall Fau lk is already itching to get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for one more week RB Ahman Green GB With Dorsey Levens troubles Green clearly shoot s up the charts Hes an enormously talented RB but hes got to learn h ow to turn that talent into on the field production After a tough Tampa Bay game last Sunday he faces a soft schedule with the Colts Panthers Bears Lions and Minnesota coming up RB Chad Morton NO With Ricky Williams out for the next weeks the logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC Morton Hes Detroit WR Johnnie Mortons little brother and was reportedly e xtremely close to Ricky Williams and shaken with his injury Hes small but ve ry quick Hes not as big as youd probably like but neither is Charli e Garner Last year at USC he carried a full load as the featured rusher s o hes capable The team hasnt announced their plans yet and bringin g in a free agent is a possibility but Id expect Morton to get a shot first New Orleans has a fairly favorable rushing schedule ahead with Oakland Denver San Francisco and Atlanta all ahead WRs Moving Up WR James McKnight Dal Wow What else can you say but give the man credit catches for yards with a TD is a pretty good day Whether he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you have to lik e what hes done thus far Hes got a brutal matchup next week in Bal timore but he might be worth grabbing to play against the Vikings in week WR Sean Dawkins Sea Excuse us for not getting excited about a guy who was buried on the Seahawks a few weeks ago and had Jon Kitna throwing to him But Kitnas looking better and Dawkins responded with a great gam e Like McKnight the question is whether he can keep it up but hes worth a roll of the dice WR Torry Holt StL I drew a few snickers a month ago when I said I thought Derrick Mason was the best WR on the Titans Im just about rea dy to call Torry Holt the best WR in St Louis And thats no knock on Isaa c Bruce Holts really coming into his own and to be honest benefits gr eatly from the attention Isaac Bruce draws He does face a couple of strong defenses in Washington and New Orleans but Im betting he manages to pr oduce against tough competition WR Derrick Mason Ten Mason is clearly the best WR on the team Partly by default as Kevin Dysons gone and Carl Pickens is injured But partly because hes just that good The Titans had their running game shut d own by Baltimore Sunday and they were forced to the air And much to the surprise of many QB Steve McNair fared pretty well and Mason was a big pa rt of that success WR Ricky Proehl StL Great just what Fantasy GMs need Another Ram WR to worry about Proehl caught passes for yards and a TD Sunday In an offense missing RB Marshall Faulk as high powered as the Rams theres probably room for another WR at the trough WR Patrick Johnson Bal Johnson replaced Travis Taylor in the lineup an d came up big with the game winning TD He only caught passes but understand that hes the rd receiver behind TE Shannon Sharpe and WR Q adry Ismail Still though its a Brian Billick team and Trent Dilfer is pl aying better with each series it seems WR Jimmy Smith Jac With catches for yards I guess you can s ay hes back The Jags may be struggling but Smith and QB Mark Brunell ar e back in synch Ride it while the combo is hot WR Jerome Pathon Ind Terrence Wilkins had a firm grasp on the WR sp ot early in the season but Pathon seems to be taking over there Pathon is playing with more confidence and more importantly seems to have the confidence of QB Peyton Manning He had catches for yards Sunday TEs Moving Up TE Bubba Franks GB For a long while Franks and TE Tyrone Davis had battled for time Its now looking like Franks has prevailed as Davis is seeing very little time Franks made a great catch of the fake kick TD an d is showing some of the athleticism that caught the Packers eye in the draft TE Rod Rutledge NE So much for Eric Bjornson Rutledge seems to be the new TE threat for the Patriots and you know Drew Bledsoe likes to throw to the TE If he can just get that thumb healthy TE Shannon Sharpe Bal After some quiet weeks Sharpe has returned to his place of one of the premier TEs in the game Hes clearly the best receiver on the team and has the confidence of QB Trent Dilfer Just as importantly he seems to have confidence in Dilfer QBs Moving Down QB Trent Green StL Mike Martz said a couple of weeks ago he felt that having Green behind center was just like having Kurt in there We believe him If youre going to deal him nows the time Even as well as hes been playing the league MVP Warner does not lose his job to a broken hand The team is talking about December as a possible date hell be back b ut I ve heard even sooner Regardless you have to figure his days are numbered Plus upcoming games against Washington and New Orleans in the next two weeks could pose a threat QB Doug Flutie Buf Right or wrong Flutie takes a seat as Rob Johnson s been named the starter this week Hold onto him though as Ive got to think the chances of Johnson staying healthy for long are slim QB Drew Bledsoe NE So much for the Boston Globes Bill Belichick conspiracy that Bledsoe would miss several weeks Still though you could clearly see he wasnt with the thumb QB Brett Favre GB As you know Favre suffered a sprained foot against Tampa While everyone was shouting about how many weeks hed miss Fav re told anyone whod listen today that he looked to be ready for this week s game against Indianapolis Players are notoriously optimistic so keep an eye on it QB Elvis Grbac KC Dont get me wrong Grbac is still a top QB He just showed Sunday hes human He really should have done more against San Francisco though On a side note didnt he say hed shave that goo fy beard when they lost QB Brian Griese Den Its the rd quarter of the Monday Night game a s I type this and its pretty obvious Brian Griese is at less than arm strength Keep an eye on this Hes a gutsy kid and has played throu gh a lot but it does seem to be affecting his play QB Charlie Batch DetAnother game another less than impressive performance Batch just seems to struggle to get anything done QB Akili Smith Cin Ive been ripping this guy for weeks and now I fe el sorta bad for him as hes been benchedfor Scott Mitchell Thats gotta hurt QB Jim Miller Chi Talk about blowing an opportunity Miller had been moving the Bears and looked to be the spark Chicago was missing with Cade McNown And then Mr Achilles decided he didnt want to participate Nasty injury and too bad as he was showing promise RBs Moving Down RB Charlie Garner SF Garners been a regular on the upgrade list an d he had another huge game Sunday where he posted total yards with a TD against the Chiefs Two big days loom on the horizon though I promise you hell be shut out in week he has a bye And then he faces San Diego and New Orleans in week and Hes a great player and one of the best RBs in the game but hell be facing some tough matchups coming up RB Ricky Williams NO As I reported yesterday to our email subscribers Ricky Williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss weeks I had to chuckle watching Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett talk about how Ricky doesn t play defense and didnt make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an d about how Rickys just one guy and theyll be fine Yada yada yada That sounds good Jim but youre in for a rude awakening if you really believ e that I dont think he does Chad Morton will be the likely replacemen t Jerald Moore will get a shot too RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka Car yards per carry will not get it done f or a featured RB in this league and thats exactly what Biakabutuka posted Sunday Hes got to get back on track if the Panthers are to be effect ive as a team RB Mike Alstott TB It seems as if Alstott is less of a factor every game He only had rushing attempts Sunday for yards If I were him Id pay Keyshawn to tell the coaches I needed some carries RB Emmitt Smith Dal What a disappointing game vs the Bengals Sunday Smith fumbled early on what should have been a sure TD and never seemed to recover I thought hed carry the load for a struggling Aikman Turne d out the other way around RB Shaun Alexander Sea So much for the idea of coach Mike Holmgren throwing in the towel for and starting the young players like Alexander The rookie is a fine player and will get his time but for now it doesnt seem to be happening anytime soon RB Trung Canidate StL Canidate broke his wrist Sunday and will miss t he rest of the season I have no idea how the Rams will function without him WRs Moving Down WR Marvin Harrison Ind Is it just me or is Marvin Harrison getting mor e and more quiet with each game He only had catches for yards Sunday and didnt seem to be a big factor Hes still one of the best WRs out there but Im worried about his production WR Terry Glenn NE Glenns faded down the stretch and the Bledsoe th umb injury wont help his play one bit Dont be too down on him as he d oes have some favorable matchups on the horizon But if Bledsoe cant go its trouble for Glenn WR Marcus Robinson Chi The loss of QB Jim Miller is huge The Bears ar e now with their QB and you can only expect so much Robinson will make any QB better but theres only so much he can do WR Antonio Freeman GB Freeman appears to be headed toward the path he was on a few weeks ago mediocrity And that was with a healthy Favre With aless than healthyFavre it could be worse WR Jacquez Green TB Keyshawn Johnsons gain is Greens loss as Q B Shaun King seems locked in on Johnson Green will still catch the occasional lo ng ball but it appears for now hes the clear cut WR WR Terrence Wilkins Ind Suddenly Terrence Wilkins is the forgotten ma n in the Colts passing game For some reason Peyton Manning just isnt giving him the looks TEs Moving Down TE Kyle Brady Jac Bradys still a solid TE but with the return of J immy Smith its clear that he wont be the big target he had been TE Jay Reimersma Buf Reimersma was a total non factor in Sundays g ame catching only pass for yards One has to think the QB shuffle could have an effect TE Itula Mili Sea Milis yielded his starting TE job to Christian F auria and Fauria seems fairly intent on keeping it Mili may be a contributor bu t it looks like he wont see enough action to make him a consistent thre at To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

play at least some The amount he could play will be determined by how Owens feels at gametime This is so tough to call as hes one of the elite WRs in the game and of Terrell Owens is better than of lots of other WRs People always want numbers so heres my opinion Chances he doesnt play at all Chances he plays but contributes less than his normal numbers Chances he plays and looks like the Owens weve been seeing Weigh that out for what its worth and make the call that best suits your team and situation Hes a high risk high reward decision this week If youre pretty well set and just need a few points out of your WR slot Id probably bench him and find another guy If you need to swing for the fences Id probably be inclined to gamble on him and keep your fingers crossed WR Derrick Mason Ten is

Undergo Knee Surgery nflnewshtml From the article St Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove loose cartilage from his right knee an injury that forced him out of Sunday nights loss to the Carolina Panthers Faulk practiced Friday and went out for pregame warmups after having the knee drained earlier Sunday but the knee began to lock on him Coach Mike Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only weeks But teammate DMarco Farr a defensive tackle was out a month with a similar operation He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there Martz said Really there was nothing else to do Justin Watson started in place of Faulk who leads the NFL with yards from scrimmage Faulk suited up for the first half but was wearing sweats after the break Watson scored on a yard run in the third quarter but finished with yards on carries Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season An MRI on Monday also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the loose cartilage My View Coach Mike Martz called him Superman last week as he battled through injuries Apparently hes mortal after all The surgery to remove the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in weeks If you started Faulk dont be kicking yourself There was nothing you or anyone else could have done As of late Sunday afternoon evening he was still the starter You cant control last minute scratches when a player has a problem during pregame warmups All Faulk owners knew he wasnt but we all know hes still one of the best RBs in the game even when dinged up Hindsight is Let it go All you can do is move forward Lets look at it analytically The problem now becomes a matter of timing If Faulk comes back according to schedule hell be ready in week or Most FF leagues play a game regular season with playoffs in weeks and or if your league hasnt wised up yet This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs For Teams that own Faulk As we predicted Justin Watson carried the load for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with yards on carries although he did get the TD Id think hell improve but its obvious Faulk not just the system is the driving force behind his success What Im saying is that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George stepping in Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate if he ever sheds the candybone label or Robert Holcombe A better option might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well right now like Chicagos James Allen Buffalos Sammy Morris or JR Redmond in New England If youve got a playoff spot secured dont panic Grab a lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs keeping your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery If you need a big push just to make the playoffs Id think very hard about dealing Faulk and shoring up your short term needs You have to remember youve got to MAKE the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl For Teams who dont own Faulk The question you must ask yourself is do you have depth somewhere that youd be willing to trade away for Faulk If you seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs it might be a great move In other words you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be a bench player for you over the next few weeks In turn you get Faulk back just in time for your playoff push But youre banking on Making the playoffs and Faulk being ready by week Only you can judge your chances for but from all Im hearing seems pretty darn likely If youve got the playoffs spot sewn up it could be a great move to trade for Faulk now Dont give up too much Dont hesitate to let the Faulk owner know that teammate DMarco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar injury and we all know a RBs knee takes much more stress with the cutting that does a Defensive Tackles Throw in some comments about St Louis resting Faulk for the playoffs Speaking of the resting for the playoff factor You have to look at how well the Saints are playing The Super Bowl champs are in real danger of not even winning their own division It looks like St Louis will be battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility the Rams resting all their players doesnt seem as likely as it did a month ago Another reason you shouldnt give up too much in trading for Faulk Make sure to sell your position either way based on whether youre a Faulk owner or not If youre trading him away you want to talk up the Saints and the tough scenarios if St Louis loses again the hot Giants are next on the road St Louis will be fighting for their lives youll say If youre dealing for Faulk obviously youll take the other side of the fence and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the postseason The truth in my opinion lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed back into service for the regular season Assuming the surgery rehab goes well of course Faulks one of the tougher guys in the league so I have no reason to believe he wont make a normal recovery Bottom line is look at this situation going forward You cant do anything about whats happened Make it work to your advantage over the next few weeks Good luck Ill see you tonight with the Upgrade and Downgrade

see the cheatsheet online weeksheethtm for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to decidi ng between players Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Stephen Davis Was vs Cowboy Defense New Coach Terry Robiskies be en saying hell run Davis into the ground Against a run defense as soft a s the Cowboys no telling how many yards hell gain The arm seems o k and I look for a huge game here RBs roll up yards on Dallas like its an average day Darnell Autry Chris Warren Phi vs Brown Defense It remains to be se en what effect if any newly signed Chris Warren will have this week It wouldnt surprise me a bit if Andy Reid isnt able to come up with a t least a small package of plays that feature Warren Hes a thousand times b etter than Darnell Autry If he cant go this week Id look for him to b e a factor next week for sure The Browns defense ranks in rushing yard s allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is enticing Fred Taylor Jac vs Cardinal Defense Every once in a while those t oo good to be true matchups dont pan out This is certainly one of t hose too good to be true situations but Id be shocked if Taylor doe snt just roll over the Cards They cant stop the run even when they know what s coming at them Arizona ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last month That number wont go down any after this week Mike Anderson Den vs Seahawk Defense Starting any player facing the Seahawks is not a bad rule of thumb Theyve been pretty bad and this week they dont stand a chance against the dominating OL of Denver Anders on practiced fully Thursday so he looks good to go Keep an eye on the weathe r as theyre expecting snow in Denver but Im not too worried about ho w itll effect Anderson Ron Dayne NYG vs Steeler Defense This was the type of game they draft ed Dayne for A ground war vs Pittsburgh in December Its not likely t he Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode whic h means pretty much no Dayne This is shaping up to be a classic battle wit h Bettis on one side and Warren on the other Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Sammy Morris Shawn Bryson Buf vs Colts Defense Keep an eye on who c an go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will likely have some good rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana There were some semi encouraging signs that Morris might be back The Colts rank just over the last weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre soft on the run and someone could make a big splash on Monday Night Charlie Garner SF vs Saints Defense Just as they are with their pass defense the Saints rush defense is overrated Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game And Garner is liable to explode at any time Hes too good in both the rushing and passing gam e to consider sitting down unless youre just loaded Warrick Dunn TB vs Miami Defense It was surprising to me to see the Dolphins slide this far on rush defense Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game Doesnt seem right but t hats what the numbers say Either way Dunns a must start given what he s done lately Robert Smith Min vs Ram Defense Like the passing defense the Rams ru sh defense has improved over the year It doesnt matter though You ve got to start Robert Smith End of story He may be the best RB in the leagu e if truth be told Emmitt Smith Dal vs Redskin Defense I think I may be the only one who sees it this way but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real statement for Smith Sure he still may not get the rd down carries as they get a look at Michael Wiley but Emmitt is pretty much working without a net here He proved his mettle once again last week hammering against a tough Tampa team The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in their passing game as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when trailing badly Washington ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so theyre very beatable Tony Richardson KC vs Panther Defense Another week another RB shakeu p in KC as this time its Kimble Anders whos out of the mix I hones tly have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it looks like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now The Panthe rs can be run on Keep an eye on the weather in this one as the passing game could be limited James Allen Chi vs Patriot Defense What a mess Chicago finds itself in The messiah QB is now healthy but still on the bench while the gu ru offensive coordinator has left been run out of town for Utah and both starting WRs are gone for the year with injuries James Allen may be the bright spot as hes run hard and effectively The New England defense c an be vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on Allen to carry a heavy load Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Edgerrin James Ind vs Bills Defense Edgerrin may be having one of th e best poor seasons in NFL history Hes posting great numbers ov erall but youll have a hard time finding a James owner whos real happy with h im If hes your guy you have very little choice but to start him in the Mond ay Night game The Colts are tougher at home and hopefully they wont fin d themselves playing catchup again Although with his receiving ability he s still active in that situation but its not the ideal scenario for any R B when his team is playing from behind The Bills rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so its a pretty average rushing defense Tyrone Wheatley Oak vs Jets Defense Ill keep an eye on this one fo r you but Im hearing while the ankles may be better a broken finger may be giving him trouble Some are speculating this is the cause of his fumbl es last week The Jets play pretty solid rush defense so its truly a mat chup that could go either way Ill try to see what I can find out on this one Michael Pittman Ari vs Jaguar Defense The Pittman injury watch continues as hes still battling turf toe He sat out of practice Thu rsday and may not know his status until Friday or Saturday If he cant go it looks like Clarence Williams could get the start If youre scrambling for RBs hes likely available in your league Even assuming Pittman can go its not a great matchup as the Jags have picked up the level of their play lately Lamar Smith Mia vs Buccaneer Defense Dont let the Buc defense scar e you Theyre a very good unit but as Emmitt Smith proved last week a determined rusher can fare ok there Lamar Smith surely falls under that determined class If hes your guy Id still go with him Tampa ranks over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game Theyre allowing an average of yards per game over that time so its not li ke theyre Baltimore yards per game over their last Curtis Martin NYJ vs Raider Defense Like Tampa the Raiders rush defen se has a bark thats a little worse than their bite Theyre solid but not a defense that sends RBs running for cover They rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Martin looked great last week and looks to be guy theyre counting on to carry the offense Eddie George Ten vs Bengal Defense Most people have this image in the ir heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run Not so Over the last four weeks only teams are tougher in allowing rushing yards per game Maybe thats because teams choose to pass the ball where Cincinn ati is weak but the bottom line is teams dont run a tremendous amount on t hem However if QB Steve McNair is limited with a bad ankle and knee you ll see a team that runs the ball as their st nd and rd option pretty much their style with a healthy McNair too George is a must start even though its no slam dunk on the matchup James Stewart Det vs Packer Defense Depending on the weather and Charl ie Batchs ribs Stewart could be asked to carry the load this week Gree n Bay is hurting on Defense with DT Steve Warren the latest injured Packer on defense On the flip side theyre playing pretty stingy rush defense averaging rushing yards allowed per game over their last which ranks them Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Brad Hoover Car vs Chief Defense With Tshimanga Biakabutuka revertin g back to his normal cant stay healthy form hes displayed fo r most of his career Hoover gets another shot this week The Chiefs are tough at home a nd the weather could be a factor possibly in his favor but Hoover will take his power rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares Kansas City ranks over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so th ey re pretty solid Travis Prentice Jamel White Cle vs Eagle Defense Neither of these gu ys is doing a great job and theyll both likely struggle against an Eagle team thats serious about defense If it were me Id look elsewhere if these were my guys Marshall Faulk Stl vs Viking Defense While theyre under appreciate d the Viking rush defense is pretty good Over the last four weeks they ra nk in rushing yards allowed per game Theyll have all they want wi th Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher ones Faulk will f ace Hes still a no brainer to start regardless of the opponent Hes reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being worried about them both Coach Mike Martz has talked about using him on special teams to help turn that unit around JR Redmond Patrick Pass Kevin Faulk NE vs Bears Defense With Redmond still ailing the Patriot RB situation is a mess And Bill Belichi ck certainly isnt shedding much light on anything Unless Redmond shows he can be Id probably shy away from all of them as its too mu ch of a shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick The Bears are playing pretty tough rush defense with rookie sensation Brian Urlacher Ahman Green GB vs Lion Defense One bright spot for the Packers this year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green Coach Mike Holmgren in Seattle could have likely saved a pick on Alexander if Green was still in Seattle Greens always had the physical skills but he lagged behin d in other areas Now he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up significantly and the results are showing on the field Its a tough ma tchup as the Lions rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed pe r game but I think hes up for it Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Ricky Watters Sea vs Bronco Defense Denver evidently didnt take k indly to Corey Dillon hanging a Hall of Fame type day on them several weeks ago as theyve been tough against the run since then Over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing just yards pe r game Watters is a solid player and not unlike an Emmitt Smith hes a guy thats made a living performing against the tough teams in tough games So its not like Im terrified of this matchup Just be aware it s a tough one One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has said at some point he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander especially in the passing game How much hed like to see isnt kn own right now Terrell Fletcher SD vs Baltimore Defense Lets not go there Baltimore is allowing an average of yards rushing per game over their last games I dont see Fletcher as the guy who breaks that trend Jerald Moore Chad Morton Terry Allen NO vs er Defense Early this week both Moore and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss Sundays game They appear to be healing ahead of schedule and now it looks like both may play Allen spent time running with the first unit in practice so its really murky right now Id tend to shy away from a ll these guys as I think theyll let QB Aaron Brooks throw the ball like he did last week Besides the ers are deceptively stingy against the rush ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game Corey Dillon Cin vs Titan Defense Yes this is a tough matchup But s o was Denver and the jersey Dillon wore in that particular tough matchup is now hanging in Canton Ohio I learned and I hope you did too to go wit h the young man pretty much regardless of the opponent Tennessee is very go od in defending the rush but I see very little way you could bench Dillon unless youre just loaded Jamal Lewis Bal vs Charger Defense Lewis is clearly the class of the rookie crop offensively I hear some say they think his early season elbo w injury was actually a blessing as it let him stay fresh I dont know about that but I do know hes running very hard and effectively He doe s draw a tough matchup this week against a Charger defense thats only allowing rushing yards per game over the last games which earns them a ranking of Still though you pretty much have to ride Lewis if he s your guy Jerome Bettis Pit vs Giant Defense This could be a classic battle between two big backs in Ron Dayne and Jerome Bettis Bettis lives for the se kind of games and hell get to lay it on the line Sunday Hes a l ikely starter in your league but the Giants are tough against the rush Over th e last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game I d still feel good about starting Bettis if he were on my roster but you need to be aware itll likely be tough going To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

see the matchups this week Please note see the cheatsheet onlineweeksheethtm for exactly where I rank playersand to determine who to start Just becau se one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup The matchup info is mea nt to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mik e Halls excellent FLM League Management Software fo r more info Here we go Locks These games heavily favor the Offense Seattle Passing Game vs Bronco Defense If weve seen one trend rece ntly in defenses its to start your QB WR TEs against the Broncos and wo rry about your RBs Theyre tough on the running game but easy against the pass I wont get into whether thats a chicken or the egg situation but the bottom line is go with your passing guys against Denver They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks QB Jon Kitna gets another start and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in him hes been ok Derrick Mayesand Sean Dawkinsshould see lots of action and rookie Darrell Jacksonis working his way back into the mix I f youve been sitting on RB Shaun Alexander coach Mike Holmgren did sa y he wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but Im still not too excited about him yet Tennessee Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Once again keep an eye on QB Steve McNairshealth this week Its early but hes already b eing called a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle injuries Keep your fingers crossed as its a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pa ss defense They rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last month and are just playing out the season Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost for the year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier Derrick Masonis the clear cut WR with Chris Sanders The best receiver on the team or at least most utilized is TE Frank Wycheckwho s starting to get back to his normal high level of production Denver Passing Game vs Seahawk Defense By now you know the drill Sta rt any player vs Seattle Just do it The Seahawks are anemic QB Brian Griese did start to throw some but hes still at least a couple weeks a way maybe more Gus Frerottegets another start and if youre looking for him to regain that yard form he showed early on this is his best chance to do it Rod Smithand Ed McCaffreyare the usual must starts at WR Dway ne Carswelland Desmond Clarkare excellent plays at TE Id start eithe r one and feel pretty good about it especially Carswell Baltimore Passing Game vs Charger Defense San Diego made a run back at respectability on defense but Im thinking theyve fallen back down t o well below average Over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be ready to roll QB Trent Dilferis playing exceptionally well and WRs Qadry Ismailand Patrick Johnsoncould do well The most enticing matchu p may be Shannon Sharpeas San Diego ranks just th in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year St Louis Passing Game vs Viking Defense I dont think you keep QB K urt Warnerdown for long Sure he had an awful game last week but some of th at can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you dont see drop half of what Warn er throws this time The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last month For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Isaac Bruce is the best WR while Torry Holthas been surprisingly disappointing lately Hes still worth a start though AzZahir Hakimalways has a chance too The Vikings just dont have the secondary to keep up with these guys Prime Matchups These games favor the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Colt Defense I probably get more mail from my ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player I make no apologies as I really just dont like the guy He simply has major troubles finishin g a game Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy one of th e weaker defenses in the league Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is questionable so they might be even less effective On the other hand th e Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home As you can see from my rankings Im not thinking too much of Johnson again this week but he does have a good matchup Eric Moulds is the primary WR as always with Peerle ss Price and Jeremy McDonald picking up the scraps TE Jay Reimersma is a favorite target and gets plenty of looks Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Giants Defense The Kordell Stewart Bandwagon is getting awfully crowded lately but for good reason Hes playing ve ry solid football More importantly he cleared a huge hurdle Sunday showing some leadership and toughness coming back in the game after injuring his leg The Giants defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim Fassells media games where he says ok more than Joe Pesci in L ethal Weapon are apparently working as his playoff guarantee seems to have inspired the team The pass defense still ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last month though For the year they rank in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Hines Ward is the WR of choice on this team and Id feel fine starting him Hes not even th e true guy but you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw For some reason I like him over starter Courtney Hawkins Even TE Mark Bruener is a solid choice as hes done more in the last two weeks than hes done in two years Kansas City Passing Game vs Panthers Defense Im dreading the Gunther Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like Iron Mike A soli d game here could help him keep his job which may have Chief fans pulling f or Carolina From a FF perspective I like Elvis Grbac here He showed Monday night he was clearly back from the finger troubles As usual the running game is a mess but thats good news for Elvis owners as hes forced to go with whats been working for them throwing the ball TE To ny Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and he s certainly the best receiver on the team Derrick Alexander is a sure starter too Sylvester Morris continues to regress which is troubling Carolina ranks just in passing yards allowed per game over the last four games although for the year theyve fared better ranking in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB Part of that is they seem to give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be leery in TD only leagues Carolina Passing Game vs Chief Defense If youve been fence sitting w ith Steve Beuerlein this may be a week to take a close look at him The Chief s rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and they may be missing CB James Hasty whos questionable with a knee WR Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and hes a sure starter Donald Hayes got through last weeks game without reinjuring his groin and hes a solid option as well TE Kris Mangum is no Wesley Wa lls but hes a pretty good player The Chiefs do get back home where they re tougher but I like this matchup San Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense The er pass defense is better than people think and the Saints defense is worse than many assume Over the last four games New Orleans ranks in passing yards allowed per game the ers rank In reality both defenses are pretty suspect And both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball Jeff Garcia picked up right where he left off last week against a tough San Die go defense It was great news for Terrell Owens fans as he looks on his way back In the meantime Jerry Rice showed he still has a few tricks in the bag I wouldnt be surprised to see Tai Streets and JJ Stokes see increased time at Rices expense though as many feel the Hall of Famer isnt in the ers plans for RB Charlie Garner is always a threat cat ching the ball TE Greg Clark is suddenly a producer so hes worth a shot to o This could be a shootout Jacksonville Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Two teams heading for the couch in the post season but thats about all they have in common Jacksonville just ran out of time as theyre playing well now Arizona is heading downhill from an already low position Arizona ranks over t he last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game QB Mark Brunell had a n injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be fine He could be a decent play along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell Arizona CB Aneaes Williams is a player but he cant do it all The biggest probl em for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a yard gain each time Minnesota Passing Game vs Ram Defense You dont need any analysis fro m me to know youd better start Daunte Culpepper Cris Carter and Randy Moss The Rams are much improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game Still though the Minnesota Big Big counting RB Robert Smith are no br ainers New Orleans Passing Game vs er Defense QB Aaron Brooks continues to b e one of the better stories of this season Hes facing a er time that ll be chock full of youngsters although theyre playing better of late rankin g in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks But that was before losing Safety Lance Shulters to a torn ACL last week Brooks will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should continue to shine Willie Jackson is a solid WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive lately Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Detroit Passing Game vs Packer Defense Of course all this hinges on the ribs of one Charlie Batch If he cant go all bets are off In fact even if he can go you should hedge your bets a bit as weve already se en one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch Its not a bad matchup though against a Green Bay defense thats ranked in passin g yards allowed per game Johnnie Morton is likely the top choice at WR wi th Herman Moore in the mix too Germane Crowell may be able to make his return this week as hes been practicing this week I wouldnt start him yet but keep an eye out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him up I can see plenty of James Stewart in this one though as the weather could be really nasty for this one Chicago Passing Game vs Patriot Defense This ones full of story line s as a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane Matthews The juicy rumor here is that according to a story in the Sun Times McNown would receive a million escalator clause if he plays i n of the offensive snaps this year and next Hes currently at Conspiracies aside Matthews will be without WR Marcus Robinson whos o ut for the year with a bulging disk in his back New England ranks ove r the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game but the turmoil coul d take its toll on the Bears The Bears will also be without Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job Some think that will be a positive I honestly have a hard time getting too excited about Eddie Kennison and Marty Booker Dallas Passing Game vs Redskin Defense Im really interested to see ho w the team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie Ill be surprised if t hey dont kick things up several notches Although I do find it odd that th e guy in charge of the worst performing part of the team passing game is t he guy they decided to elevate to head coach Who knows QB Troy Aikman will try to get through another game without being maimed Hell have J ames McKnight and Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promisin g against a pretty tough defense Dallas showed last week the complete lac k of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding Emmitt Smith the ball as they trailed Tampa by a mile David LaFluer and Jackie Harris both are dropping along with Aikman Philadelphia Passing Game vs Brown Defense Two teams used to bringing up the rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping QB Donovan McNabb finds himself in a strange spot here The Browns are so pitiful against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them at the expense of throwing it But with McNabb the teams best rusher he ll have to decide which way hes going to beat the Browns Charles Johnson an d Torrance Small arent much TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he could make some noise Im interested to see how quickly they work in newly signed RB Chris Warren Miami Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Another good case of misconceptions Miami is better throwing the ball than people give them credit for and the Bucs arent as dominant stopping the pass like many think Over the last four weeks Tampa ranks in passing yards allowe d per game Very solid for sure but not dominating Jay Fiedler continu es to astound his critics as he threw for TDs Sunday I dont think you ll see the same production here but hes still a decent play Leslie Shep herd had been my favorite WR here but with his surgery it looks like Tony Mart in will finally get a start Oronde Gadsden continues to make sick catches Downside Matchups These games favor the Defense Cleveland Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This is where Doug Pedersons at He gets the start this week because rookie Spergon Wynn cant go due to injury WR Kevin Johnson is running the scout team in practice Agai nst the tough Eagles secondary he likely will have trouble no matter where he lines up I dont look for much here from any of these guys Cincinnati Passing Game vs Titan Defense The Bengals just wont die quietly Corey Dillon keeps running the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott Mitchellseems intent on proving to folks he really can play at this level He may be able to but he draws a tough matchup Sunday in a Titan team that s solid They rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed pe r game Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad wrist and will likely have to play with a brace WR Peter Warrickwill reportedly have his contact lenses Thursday and that could make a difference Hes often worth a roll of the dice for the start as he ha s the big play potential New York Giant Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The Steelers seemed to enjoy the spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot this week against the Giants Pittsburghs playing tough pass defense now as they rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four games Kerry Collinsis steady but not exciting Hell be throwing t o WRs Amani Toomerand Joe Jureviciusas it looks like Ike Hilliard may not be fully ready yet this week Keep an eye on that one though TE Pete Mitchellhasnt been nearly the factor wed thought hed be Oakland Passing Game vs Jets Defense The Raiders look to bounce back th is week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and distance The Jets are playing tough defense of late ranking in passi ng yards allowed per game over the last four weeks Still though QB Rich Gannonis a pretty much sure starter unless youre loaded at QB Same thing with WR Tim Brown You might roll the dice on Andre Risonor James Jettbut Brown is the man TE Ricky Dudley is likely worth a start just on potential but hes incredibly frustrating like I needed to tell the D udley owners THAT Green Bay Passing Game vs Lion Defense Not only must the Lions defense hit the field without star CB Bryant Westbrook they also have to face Bre tt Favrein the cold weather where hes invincible Check the weather conditions for this one as it could be more than just cold Hes good when its freezing outside but trying to throw the ball in a driving snowsto rm is an entirely different matter Favre will be throwing to WR Bill Schroede r who I think is the better WR choice over mega bucks Antonio Freeman TE Bubba Franksis always worth a look RB Ahman Greenis a nice surprise a nd hes catching the ball well New York Jets Passing Game vs Raider Defense Two teams thatll see what theyre made of square off in a Sunday Night matchup The Raiders are t ough against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the la st four weeks QB Vinny Testeverdeseems to have finally gotten himself untracked WR Wayne Chrebetmay be handled by Charles Woodson but that leaves Dedric Wardand Windrell Hayesfor WRs Theyll be fine FB Ri chie Andersonquietly racks up receiving totals and he could have a good day aga in this week TE Anthony Becht continues to play well and is really coming along New England Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Star QBs on the bench Coaches leaving Whats a player to think If youre a defensiv e player for the Bears youre thinking youd better go out and prove some pe ople wrong that think youre finished Chicago plays tough pass defense rank ing in passing yards allowed per game over the last four week QB Drew Bledsoe will look for WR Terry Glennand the suddenly red hot Troy Brown TEs Rod Rutledgeand Jermaine Wigginshold down the TE spot I hope Shockmain Davis gets a TD as I love to write his name Indianapolis Passing Game vs Bills Defense QB Peyton Manningis still a starter in most leagues but you should know hes facing a tough matchup this week He struggled a bit last time these teams met with a season low yards passing although he did have TDs Marvin Harrisonis of course the clear cut Guy It looks like Terrence Wilkinsis finally breaki ng out of his slump and could be a contributor again Both TEs Ken Dilgerand Marcus Pollardhavent played up to their potential of late Even wit h the bad game last week against Miami the Bills still rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed per game Defensive Slam Dunks These games heavily favor the Defense Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Miami Defense Dont start your passing ga me guys against the Dolphins CBs Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain just shut people down Especially a QB like Shaun King whos not healthy in addition to being just an adequate QB Keyshawn Johnson is almost always worth a start just for the showmanship but Im not excited about Tampa throwing the ball here Washington Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Brad Johnsonsprobably tak en his last snap as a Redskin especially after he suggested hed done so That means big armed Jeff Georgetakes the helm Hell likely face a Cow boy defense thats tough against the pass for one simple reason theyre awful defending the run and teams just choose to run all over them Look for Stephen Davis to wear it out When George does throw I think James Thrashis the best option Albert Connellwill likely start but Thrash makes plenty of plays TE Stephen Alexanderis probably worth a shot as is pass catching FB Larry Centers San Diego Passing Game vs Raven Defense Ryan Leafand company get the honor of facing the ranked defense over the past weeks in pas sing yards allowed per game It should be interesting Leaf will be throwing to TE Freddie Jonesand WR Curtis Conway Jeff Graham suffered a mouth injury last week and may need dental surgery Its probably just as wel l as this matchup is looking very sketchy for Leaf Arizona Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense This could get ugly all around Jacksonville ranks over the last four weeks in passing yards allowed p er game And Arizonas Jake Plummeris nursing bad ribs We saw with Cha rlie Batch last week that its hard for a team to keep a QB in the game if h es got injured ribs David Bostonis playing well lately and Frank Sanders h as been awful Im not excited about any of them for this week To unsubscribe from this group send an email to

youre like me and I know many of you are this game can take on a lif e and death seriousness The topsy turvy season may be good for Neilson Ratings but not so good for your blood pressure Sometimes the best thin g to do is laugh a little With that said Im forwarding a column I found entertaining from one of our favorite Sportswriters Bill Simmons of ESPNcom I do this every so often And I always get a bunch of email yelling about I didnt sign up for this and to keep it serious and on Football Sav e your breath Unsubscribe instructions are at the bottom of this email Lets jump to Mr Simmons You can find the original article here pagessimmonshtml Lighten Up Joe Whazzup with the NFL By Bill Simmons ESPNcom With apologies to CNNSIs Peter King here are things I think I think after six weeks of the NFL season I think this has been the strangest NFL season in recent memory The media usually starts their This has been the strangest season ever buzz around Week or Week its an NFL October Tradition right up there with my girlfriend asking on Sunday at noon if I want to go applepicking me following that question up with the answer What are you insane and her storming out of the house but this season really has been the strangest season of alltime Consider the following things Twenty of the NFL teams have records of or better The short list of quality teams this season includes Chicago San Diego and San Francisco combined record last season Out of the nine consensus Super Bowl contenders from the preseason only three of them Green Bay St Louis and Philadelphia have winning records The other six Indy Tampa Baltimore Tennessee Denver and the Giants ar e a combined After the favorites went against the spread in the first four weeks the underdogs went over the next two weeks Thats impossible The Patriots are slightly aboveaverage as a football team maybe even a little better when you factor in their coaching staff and team chemistry and there isnt an NFL team they couldnt beat if they played well and get two or three breaks No victory is out of their grasp Seriously And just for the record I feel the same way about the Browns and Falcons Along those same lines other than St Louis there isnt a reliable favorite in the league anymore Remember the days when you could count on a contender to bounce back from an embarrassing defeat the following week What happened to Denver and Baltimore last week Didnt they get the memo Remember the days when you could throw two quality home teams into a twoteam tease and assume they would cover at home like Tampa New Orleans and Indianapolis for instance Remember the days when the home team was money on Monday nights like this week with the Giants I miss those days And so does my wallet So whats left Im not sure We already achieved Pete Rozelles vision of a paritydriven NFL two seasons ago when the to underdog Rams cruised to a Super Bowl title Now weve reached a point where the league has becom e predictably unpredictable Its a gamblers worst nightmare Which reminds me I think the local weatherman in hell will report Temperatures in the midteens all weekend before I wager on a team that prominently features Jo n Kitna again a I think that theres excruciating theres really excruciating and then theres the experience of watching Carolinas Chris Weinke throwing tw o interceptions inside the yardline in the first half against a brutal Redskins team then singlehandedly giving the Skins life with minutes remaining in a game by tossing a screen pass right to LaVar Arrington for a yard interception and touchdown Can everyone who wagered on the Panthers last Sunday file a classaction suit against Weinke Has this ever been done before b I think the lesson here as always is Never wager on a team with a crappy QB And I knew this I knew this Normally Id fine myself but the financial bloodbath has already been devastating enough Does anyone know a good pawn shop in the Boston area Whoops Im using my outloud voice again c I think I miss the days when you could recoup your pm gambling losses by wagering on two sturdy pm teams in Message Game situations For instance Sunday featured Denver coming off an embarrassing loss in Seattle and heading into San Diego for an AFC West tilt as well as the Packers looking to drive a stake in Minnesotas season and extend their lea d in the NFC Central In the old days you could rely on the Mike Shanahans and Brett Favres of the world to save your butt Not anymore As I told my buddy JBug last night This has become a league which I am unfamiliar with All of the gambling rules accrued over the years you might as well throw them out the window I give up I think I always get excited for those Coors Light commercials with Barr y Sanders for one reason Sanders possesses the strangest hairline of anyone on the planet And just for the record that includes Shane Battier Roy Firestone Elton John and Brad Daugherty Note Somebody needs to release the Barry Sanders Wig for Halloween this month along with the Dave Campo Wig the Troy Aikman Concussion Mask the Dave Wannstedt Fake Mustache the Al Groh BlowUp Doll and the Fred Taylor Pull Your Own Groin StartUp Kit Im telling you NFL Collectibles shoul d have a whole Halloween Department Its a nobrainer They could even release an NFL Legends collection so we could finally get our hands on the Bruce Coslet Wig Can somebody make this happen please I think it took frustrating years but Doug Flutie finally found the right NFL team Its funny how life works out had the Bills decided to keep him over Rob Johnson Flutie would have spent his twilight years on a rebuilding team Instead hes the proverbial Right Guy Right Place Righ t Time on a team where he doesnt have to carry the offensive load unles s its absolutely necessary like Sunday when Denver stacked the line agains t the sublime LaDainian Tomlinson putting the game in Fluties hands a I think Tampa Bay made an enormous mistake going for Brad Johnson over Flutie and I think it probably costs Tony Dungy his job within the next one to four months b I think its fair to say that the list of Reliable Quarterbacks Who Ca n Consistently Win Games has been whittled down to four Brett Favre Kurt Warner Jeff Garcia and Flutie Thats it Thats the list Think about it Daunte Culpepper and Donovan McNabb make too many mistakes Brian Griese Rich Gannon and Mark Brunell are only as good as the people around them Peyton Manning is slapping together a Karl Malonetype career and his Ewing Theory potential is jumping off the charts Steve McNair an d Chris Chandler cant stay healthy Drew Bledsoe has been hideously exposed by Tom Brady more on this in a second Look at the list again Favre Warner Flutie and Garcia Three of those four guys were forced to prove themselves in other professional leagues before another NFL team even gave them a chance I ask you again is this a weird NFL season or what I think weve reached the section of the Things column where Im supposed to talk about nonsports items like high school field hockey and Starbucks Racking my brain All right Im ashamed to admit this but Monday night I went to see the new Drew Barrymore movie Riding in Cars with Boys accompanying the Sports Gal as p art of our She wont bitch about the fact that I spend seven hours every Sunday watching football if I escort her to an occasional chick flick and dont bitch about it deal Savvy huh I only have two hopes with chick flicks that theyre short and that there s a cute actress prominently involved Needless to say since Riding in Cars lasted for interminable minutes and the wheels came off the Drew Barrymore is a babe bandwagon about three years ago I spent the last minutes trying to pull a piece of metal off the bottom of my seat so I coul d jam it into my jugular vein Even the Sports Gal didnt like the movie that much and this is coming from a person who was peeved that the Academy Awar d committee snubbed The Wedding Planner last spring Five disturbing phenomenons about the chick flick Every chick flick has a scene where either A a male baby pees on somebody B theres a wedding andor C theres an unredeeming male character who lets somebody down This is apparently a rule If you can work all three of those scenes in the same movie the director apparently gets a bonus Whenever I see a chick flick theres always a moment when I accidentally make eye contact with another boyfriend or spouse at the theater and we quickly glance away Its like seeing somebody in the adult section of a video store youre just hoping nobody will recognize you and things will move along as quickly as possible Ill sum up the storyline from every chick flick Men suck Theres always a specific threesome sitting somewhere in the theater during every chick flick one girl sitting between two guys Why two I have no idea Usually they seem like platonic friends the girl isnt very attractive at least one of the guys looks like Tim Burton and the guys overlaugh at every joke in the movie to the point that you start rooting for one of them to choke to death on a Sour Patch Kid Again Im not sure whats going on here Every time you block out the fact that youre watching a chick flick something funny happens and everyone in the theater starts laughing a highpitched cacophony of giggles that reminds you Hey Im at a chick flick Thats usually when I start bludgeoning myself over the head with m y ounce Mountain Dew Anyway on a scale of to Id give Riding Cars with Boys a minus Lets forget this section ever happened and if youre attending any showings of Serendipity in the Boston area over the next few weeks and se e someone who looks like me please dont make eye contact with that person For everyones sake I think the Tom Brady Era is taking the Ewing Theory to the next level especially considering that your buddy Sports Guy predicted a Ewingresurgence for the Patriots before Week You had the overhyped overvalued superstar who never really won anything and received an inordinate amount of media attention and fan hype Drew Bledsoe You had the requisite injury during the season that caused everyone to write the team off Bledsoe going down in Week possibly for the season You had everyone writing the team off And then You had the team immediately running off a streak including two I cant believe this is happening wins both over Indy as well as an improbable comeback win over San Diego showing more life than theyve shown in years Now you have the local media searching for answers to explain how a team can lose its franchise player and inexplicably start playing better And everyone keeps saying that the Patriots have come out o f nowhere You know better Just for the record I officially abandoned my seat on the Bledsoe Bandwago n at on Sunday afternoon when the Pats took a lead in Indianapolis and I called my father just to pretend I was Paul Tagliabue announcing With the first pick of the expansion draft the Houston Texans select Drew Bledsoe quarterback New England Patriots Sounds farfetched Remember they signed Bledsoe to a mammoth contract extension last spring they couldnt trade him without absorbing an impossible salary cap hit But according to NFL rules any player who gets selected in the expansion draft has his contract and cap figure transferred to the Texans even the prorated bonus payments which means the Pats could leave Bledsoe unprotected and hope the Texans gobble him up which would clear million to million in cap space to spend in free agents next spring Mmmmmm cap space I think Tampa Bay and Indianapolis should trade coaches Dungy straightup for Jim Mora Why dont teams ever trade coaches in sports Whats the worst thing that could happen What about Marty Schottenheimer and two Schottenheimers to be named later for George Seifert and cash Couldnt this work or am I crazy I think Buffalos Travis Henry always looks like one of those stubborn buffaloes on the Discovery Channel that fight off four or five cheetahs before they finally get dragged down Last week against the Jaguars he had carries for yards even though he was hit three yards behind the line by four defenders on every carry High comedy His career might not last until November at this rate I think Chicago and Pittsburgh are shaping up as the Out of Nowhere Teams in each conference this season those basement teams that beef up against crappy opponents shock the experts win games and scare the heck out of the bookmakers in Vegas given that they were long shots to win it all before the season Both teams run the ball effectively avoid takin g chances on offense swarm the ball on defense and make plays on special teams in other words theyre following Baltimores playbook to a tee Chicagos resurgence wasnt that improbable given that somebody strange wa s coming out of the NFC Central but Pittsburgh Did you ever envision the m at when four of their first five were on the road Now they finish up with seven of their last at home Yikes Its almost enough to make you forget that Kordell Stewarts still involved Almost Keep in mind just in case the Bears or Steelers stumble over the next few weeks there are an inordinate amount of other Out of Nowhere candidates San Fran San Diego Cleveland Atlanta and New England For all we know all of those teams might make the playoffs this season but the schedule seems to favor Chicago and Pittsburgh over everyone else For all we know all of those teams might sneak into the playoffs Its been that kind of season I think that Any Given Sunday was a flawed movie to say the least crippled by brutal editing suicidal casting decisions and a script that meandered all over the place And yet one scene makes it all worth it You know the one Its the scene when Al Pacino as coach Tony DeMarco throws the movie on his back before the Big Game You know when you get old in life things get taken from you Thats part of life But you only learn that when you start losing stuff You find out that lifes a game of inches So is football Because in either game life or football the margin for error is so small I mean one half a step too late or too early and you dont quite make it One halfsecond too slow o r too fast you dont quite catch it The inches we need are everywhere aroun d us Theyre in every break of the game every minute every second Now the players are clapping On this team we fight for that inch On this team we tear ourselves and everyone around us for that inch We claw with our fingernails for that inch Because we know that when we add up all those inches we know thats gonna make the difference between winning and losing Between living and dyingNow the players are screaming along with every wordI ll tell you this in any fight its the guy whos willing to die whosg onna win that inch Now I cant make you do it You gotta look at thegu y next to ya look into his eyes and I think youre gonna see a guy whowi ll go that inch with youThe light bulb finally clicks for enigmatic QB Willie Beamon he strollstoward his coach inspired Youre gonn a see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because heknows when it comes down to it youre gonna do the same for him Thats ateam gentl eman And either we heal now as a team or we will die asindividuals Thats football guys Thats all it isDramatic pauseNow what ar e you gonna doComplete Pandemonium in the locker room Chills galore And the team burstsout of the locker room in slow

Gary Due to Health of Davis Entire story footballnewsravensbroncosap Clipped from the Don Banks article As has become the norm the NFL trading deadline passed Tuesday without a move But a headline deal that would have sent Denver running back Olandis Gary to the defending Super Bowl champion Ravens nearly came to fruition Monday according to sources within the Baltimore organization The Ravens senior vice president of football operations Ozzie Newsome and Broncos general manager Neal Dahlen spoke several times Monday and had in place the framework of a trade that would have sent Gary and a fourthround pick in to the Ravens for reserve defensive tackle Lionel Dalton and Baltimores secondround selection next year But the dealbreaker according to Ravens sources was the everconfusing issue of Terrell Davis health Ravens officials believe their deal with Denver was alive until late in the afternoon when Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan became convinced that he could not count on Davis to return to health this year even as a backup to starter Mike Anderson It is believed that Davis himself on Monday may have nixed the trade of Gary by informing Shanahan that he is uncertain when he will be able to play again Davis has been out since requiring arthroscopic surgery on his troubled right knee following Denvers seasonopening win against the Giants Baltimore officials said there were some indications coming from the Broncos that Davis may have a new setback in the form of a stress fracture injury similar to the one he suffered in his lower left leg last year Davis was expected to miss six weeks after having surgery to remove debris and repair a small cartilage tear on Sept Davis who gained yards on carries in the Broncos opener missed of games in due to leg injuries The Broncos have described his right knee troubles as a degenerative condition and it was thought that Shanahan was not counting on Davis as anything other than a fallback option this season behind Anderson and Gary Anderson tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in then suffered ankle and stress fracture injuries in his left leg last year This is the second time in about six months that the Ravens and Broncos have gotten close to a deal for a running back only to have Denver back away in the end On the first day of the NFL draft in late April the Broncos were offering Anderson to the Ravens in exchange for a secondround pick Baltimore officials said they were agreeable but that Shanahan changed his mind and pulled the offer off the table Sources say some within the Ravens organization feel twice burned at this point in terms of trade talks with Denver Gary is the youngest running back in the Broncos stable of three yard rushers He gained yards in just games after replacing the injured Davis in then saw his season cut to just one game by an ACL injury He is currently Andersons backup Garys contract with Denver ends after this season The team has not made much progress toward an extension Andersons deal was extended just before the Broncos seasonopening game Baltimore has been involved in offagain offagain trade talks with Denver about Gary since Aug when it lost its leading rusher Jamal Lewis to a seasonending ACL injury The Ravens signed veteran Terry Allen to replace Lewis and Baltimore has been making do with a combination of Allen and secondyear veteran Jason Brookins Baltimore officials say the Broncos instigated the latest round of trade communication contacting the Ravens to restart the Gary talks in recent days Considered the AFCs top two Super Bowl contenders both teams are underachieving at and coming off consecutive road losses Davis has practiced the last two weeks on the Broncos scout team and originally was expected to return in time for the Nov game at Oakland But on Monday Shanahan held out the possibility that Davis could return a week early in time for Sundays game against the New England Patriots Davis showing in practice this week would make the determination Shanahan said OUR VIEW Are these guys worth the headache I think not Id expect some rebuttal denial from the Denver side this morning to follow Don Banks is well respected and of course Sports Illustrated is at the top of our game but Im always a little leery of the unnamed Raven sources Could be sour apples on a trade that didnt go right for them Or it could be exactly how it is Bottom line is this certainly doesnt look good for Davis owners Lets see what the Broncos say and you can go from there Of course you can always do the smart thing and rid yourselves of any Denver RBs Not promising youll win your league but you may come out ahead with the money you save on Rolaids More today Joe Thanks to Footballguy Chris Smith Smitty on

within the hour and I wanted to throw this out KTCK in Dallas has confirmed to Footballguyscom that Dallas QB Anthony Wright may require surgery on his knee Its apparently not responding to treatment as theyd hoped If it happens this would put the starting job in the hands of Clint Stoerner or Ryan Leaf If thats the case Id have to think this cant be good for anybody Emmitt Smith has a chance with Wright throwing the ball downfield but with another QB likely to struggle Id think you have to downgrade all the Cowboys More as we hear it Joe Thanks to Footballguy Gary Slinkard for pointing me to this one If you want to know more about the QB situation than anyone can possibly want to know heres a detailed article from Mickey Spagnola Entire story cgibinCowboysnewsmickeysjsp On one hand the Cowboys have The Ryan Package On the other hand they have fluid on Anthony Wrights knee Could the two be fixin to collide this week Well lets try to answer that and a whole lot more as we catch up with these Cowboys who reconvened here at The Ranch on Monday following this past weekends inactivity Yes Anthony Wright did practice on Monday after missing last weeks only two practices with fluid on his knee He seemed to throw well But he didnt have to run around much and after practice this excess fluid on Wrights right knee that was surgically reconstructed in seemed to subdue his mood Some of the swelling is gone said Wright seemingly still concerned with the knee he irritated in the Monday night victory over Washington But that reduced swelling did not seem to placate Wright He seemed worried An MRI last Thursday suggested there was no structural damage Wright said he was to receive another exam by the doctors on Tuesday which should become the telltale check for this week As for head coach Dave Campo he reaffirmed his belief in Wright as the starter and along with the Cowboys trainers seemed confident Wright would be able to start Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals at Texas Stadium If the swelling does not subside in all likelihood the fluid would be drained from Wrights knee before the game Hes the starter and well continue to get Ryan Leaf extra work and see where were at at then end of the week Campo said Leaf is No right now but well see That would seem to be the crack in the door suggesting the Cowboys would rather go with Ryan Leaf as the starter if the knee gets in Wrights way this week rather than Clint Stoerner Say what you want thats the difference between NFL starts and no NFL starts They want to put a package together that Im confident in said Leaf who took the first team snaps in last weeks two practices The Ryan package I guess Right now its getting bigger and bigger every day They certainly seem to want me out there when Im ready And it certainly seems Leaf is doing all he can to get ready as soon as possible He comes here early He leaves late He works on his off day and even though he did take this past weekend off the fourthyear quarterback at least took his playbook with him Im just eating it alive Leaf said of his extra work I took my playbook home as he talked about how he and his wife Nicole would go through the playbook together and that hell live in a hotel until she gets them moved into an apartment here in Dallas There is no time to waste So then knowing there is a Ryan Package and knowing Wrights knee isnt right just yet would Leaf be ready to start on Sunday against the Cards if Wright wasnt Thats probably asking a lot Leaf said Clint knows the offense well and would deserve to start But Ill be as ready as I can And if asked by the coaching staff if he was ready to start Leaf said I probably couldnt do as many things but Ill never say no And for a guy who hasnt experienced much success in the league at least not what youd have expected from the second pick in the draft at least thats a good sign He hasnt lost any confidence in himself Speaking of his first three seasons in the league and a shoulder injury robbed Leaf of his season in San Diego hes thrown touchdown passes and been intercepted times while starting of games The guy taken in front of him in that draft Peyton Manning threw touchdown passes and was intercepted times while starting of games his first two seasons And bringing it closer to home Troy Aikman threw touchdown passes and was intercepted times his first two seasons Knowing what you knew about the Cowboys defense going into the season would you have given that unit a snowballs chance in hell of having a higher NFL ranking than say Tampa Bay Tennessee and the New York Football Giants going into Mondays night game to complete Week of play Get out of here But it says right here in these NFL rankings the Dallas Cowboys are th giving up yards a game And it says Tampa Bay is th the Giants th going into their Monday night game with Philadelphia Denver th and Jacksonville th Tennessee Good gosh the Titans are th Come on those are teams littered with Pro Bowl defenders Bet they arent starting a fourthround pick and a sixthrounder at cornerbacks And remember thats Randall Godfrey starting at middle linebacker for the leagues thranked defense not Dat Nguyen

the latest info as you manage your teams Lets jump to it Joe Chicagos Dick Jauron We dont want to be a singleback running team Entire story bearscontentstoryhtml Clipped from the Fred Mitchell article Hop on the A Train Bears players and fans are climbing aboard But the coaching staff still seems to be standing in line waiting to have its ticket punched Anthony Thomas rushed for a Bears rookierecord yards in carries for an yard average and one touchdown Sunday But those remarkable accomplishments during the Bears trouncing of the Bengals merely earned Thomas the designation of the hot back of the week in the eyes of Bears coaches Thomas yards rank eighth all time among all Bears rushers It was the sixthbest rushing effort against a Bengals team We like our tandem said coach Dick Jauron We dont want to be a singleback running team I believe James Allen is pretty good Whoever is hot if hes hot hell get more carries Allen a fourthyear veteran from Oklahoma rushed for yards in a game against Baltimore in only to have thenBears coach Dave Wannstedt say Lets not put him in the Hall of Fame just yet Thomas alternated with Allen for the first several series Sunday until Thomas clearly outperformed the veteran Allen wound up with yards on seven carries average His longest run was yards Thomas had a long run of yards as well as a yard touchdown jaunt The offensive line did a great job Thomas said They were opening up lanes that probably anybody could run through Every time you go out you want to get better Thomas routinely bulled his way through the Bengals defense requiring several players to bring him down The guy can pound the football said quarterback Jim Miller of the secondround draft pick out of Michigan He has good feet hes big feet inch pounds and he powers it forward We knew he was going to be good It was just a matter of time Hes a smart kid He has picked up the offense very well Miller connected on of passes for yards and two touchdowns But it was the running game that buoyed the Bears offense which netted yards You just kind of go with the guy whos hot said Miller echoing the sentiment of the coaching staff Anthony was just so hot and running so well and they were having a hard time tackling him The coaches just kind of made a decision to go with the hot back Were going to need James too We want to get to the point where theres a punch The Bengals defense looked punchy in the second half Thomas had yards in only nine carries at halftime Come the fourth quarter those guys couldnt stop him Miller said Our offensive line was kicking their fannies again You could just see it on the field That defensive line wanted no part of our offensive line They were abusing those guys Jauron praised Thomas performance but seemed to want to evaluate his effort within the team concept We called his number more during the game Jauron said But in every game we have x number of plays earmarked for him Sometimes you dont get to them all It was in an exhibition game against the Bengals on Aug that Thomas hurt his knee setting him back in training camp Sundays record showing raises the bar of expectations for Thomas who hadnt rushed for more than yards previously in the NFL I know some of the guys who played like Gale Sayers and Walter Payton Thomas said And its a compliment that some of those guys didnt do this Its something thats real high and something I can think about the rest of my life OUR VIEW Hard to tell how this will go Weve been expecting Thomas to start stealing more and more carries but honestly didnt see this explosion coming this soon It seems pretty clear to me that Thomas has something special while Allen just doesnt This could be a motivation thing for Thomas so he keeps his head amidst the Walter Payton Gale Sayers talk And it could be handling James Allen so he stays positive But bottom line is I think youll continue to see good things from Thomas just maybe not quite the full fledged feature back Yet Doug Chapman to Start Again Entire story storieshtml Clipped from the Kent Youngblood article Michael Bennetts right ankle is sore enough that the Vikings probably wont have to worry this week how to split practice time at running back Doug Chapman had the best game by a Vikings running back this season in Sundays victory over Green Bay a game in which the team had its best running game in four seasons So the question of whom is the starter longterm wasnt something Vikings coach Dennis Green was worried about Monday Hes not ready No Green said of Bennett So when we get to that point we will look at it But his ankle is not ready yet Bennett was doing better in straightline running but hasnt tested his ability to cut or move side to side I just dont think hes going to be ready in one week Green said Ankles just dont heal normally in one week He had a pretty serious ankle injury Hes working hard at rehabilitation so the sooner the better Players normally dont lose their starting roles because of injury But Chapmans performance Sunday certainly gave Vikings coaches confidence in his ability We always knew he could run running backs coach Carl Hargrave said It was a matter of having an opportunity And he took advantage of the opportunity I think were going to play things out the way they are As long as youre healthy youre going to stay with the healthy guy Chapman who gained yards on carries credited the offensive line Im glad the line got some confidence he said Thats the main thing They set the tone protected quarterback Daunte Culpepper opened some holes for me Chapman likely has earned a lot of playing time even when Bennett gets healthy But Green wasnt ready to take that issue on yet The good thing is we can do it any way we want to because we dont put the same value on starting as a lot of people do Green said We put it in the contribution who is going to help us win thats what it comes down to So when it comes to that time well look at who is going to give us the best chance to win Thats who well play Michael Bennett has the commanding lead for Rookie Bust of the Year Doug Chapman looked excellent and put to rest a lot of the finger pointing by Bennett supporters that the OL or the system was to blame Denny Greens not one to admit he was wrong too often so I think youll see that serious ankle injury linger for as long as Chapman keeps performing Dont forget this kid scored about TDs okay when he was at Marshall Hes a player so dont count him out Canidate to Likely Get Another Start Entire Story stltodaysports Clipped from the Nick Wishart article Get ready for more Trung Canidate The Rams No running back probably will start again Sunday at home against the New Orleans Saints with Marshall Faulk expected to be a scratch for the second week in a row I wouldnt expect Marshall to be up for this game coach Mike Martz said Monday adding that Faulk will be listed as questionable on the midweek injury report Hes got to be percent before I would be convinced that weve got to let him play And if hes not then he doesnt play Faulk sat out practice last week and missed Sundays game because of a bruised right knee suffered a week earlier against the Giants Canidate in his first career start performed brilliantly in relief rushing for yards and two touchdowns in the Rams win over the New York Jets Martz described Canidates performance as a relief But he added It doesnt change whether Marshall would be up You just cant do that You are really running a risk Weve got so much of the season left Weve got to do the right thing Were just going to see where he is probably Wednesday or Thursday OUR VIEW Looks like you Canidate owners can pony up for another week Clearly this is a radically different situation than with Michael Bennett as Faulk will certainly be the starter once hes ready Its just that with Canidates great performance Coach Martz can take his time letting Faulk get back to In a league full of teams not fulfilling expectations you can be sure the Rams are determined to keep meeting their lofty goals and that means having Faulk at full speed for the longest time possible Theyll face New Orleans this week and then have week off for their bye Thats even more reason not to push him back too early We can wring our hands in week as to wholl get the carries but for me Id expect another week of Canidate for now An early matchup thought to keep in mind though The Jets rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks while New Orleans ranks Mixed Signals on Shaun Alexander Entire story htmlsportshawkhtml Clopped from the Percy Allen article KIRKLAND The key components to their offensive resurgence can be traced to a trio of Seahawks reserves that few had counted on just weeks ago A pair of backups and a prominent castoff were thrown into starting roles and because of them Seattle rebounded from consecutive lopsided defeats with backtoback victories Consider running back Shaun Alexander quarterback Trent Dilfer and offensive tackle Todd Weiner improbable stars for an improbable team that finds itself among the NFLs elite And yet when Seattle one of six AFC teams with a winning record meets Miami on Sunday at Husky Stadium Dilfer and Weiner arent likely to be in the starting lineup In a few weeks Alexander will join them on the sideline when Ricky Watters recovers from a shoulder injury An unwritten rule in the NFL says players dont lose their jobs because of injury However Coach Mike Holmgren admits that sometimes he follows this policy and sometimes he doesnt A lot of times you get stuck when a player feels like you werent honest with him Holmgren said Theres a lot of things that can happen Generally speaking a veteran player who can come back and play normally he doesnt lose his starting position But every once in awhile for whatever reasons you might want to go one more week with a certain combination My main concern is that the player knows what were doing OUR VIEW I for one have trouble with the player cant lose his job to injury conventional wisdom If Dilfers healthy hed be my guy Although I can see Holmgrens angle if hes playing for the long term Although Id be worried about Jerry Glanvilles famous quote about the NFL stands for Not For Long The worry for Holmgren from a leadership point of view is staying consistent How does he bench Dilfer when Hasselbeck is ready but not bench Alexander when Watters can go If Holmgren is focused on the future he could make a case that hes being consistent in keeping a long term focus Few people think Dilfer is the long term guy and most everyone expects Alexander to take over for Watters next season Therefore hed be playing his future guys Youve probably got a couple more weeks before you have to worry about this but it might make a difference in your trade free agency dealings Thatll do it for now Folks Talk to you soon Joe Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights

good folks check em out Joe Hi Folks Heres how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom when its posted Thursday for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Edgerrin James or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Rushing Game Matchups Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Carolinas Richard Huntley Nick Goings Fred Hoover vs New York Jets Defense Who didnt see an injury coming for Biakabutuka Or Terry Glenn Or Fred Taylor I know there are lots of arguments out there that the injury prone tag is unjustified for some players but in my opinion you shouldnt be surprised to see guys like Biakabutuka go down Coach George Seifert has said hes giving Huntley the Golden Opportunity as the starting RB this week Lets see what he can do with it Cant think of a better defense to run on than the pathetic Jets New York ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks giving up a whopping rushing yards a game They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dont underestimate the loss of OL Kevin Donnalley though He was a valuable part of the line One other semi troubling fact is that Brad Hoover had Red Zone rushes last week Still though if there was ever a week to start Huntley this is it Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense Its hard to get too excited about Emmitt Smith these days but this is a good matchup for him The Cowboys have had a week off and theyll be facing the soft Arizona defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs QB Anthony Wright has another week of practice under the belt and should be able to provide some passing threat to open the running game At least thats the theory Youve got to pick your spots with Smith and this looks like a pretty good one if youve been considering playing him Indianapolis Edgerrin James vs Kansas City Defense Start James Yes hes in a slump ranking just in Fantasy Points over the last games but you have to start him Especially against the Kansas City defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks If you doubt a guy like James remember he had Red Zone rushes last week Thats more than a lot of backs have for the season Hes getting the opportunities Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Indianapolis Defense Priest Holmes had another solid game last week against the soft Arizona defense rushing for yards on carries ypc This week hell face an equally bad Colt defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs DE Chad Bratzke is doubtful and thatll help Holmes For now it looks like Tony Richardson is being eased back into the mix Look to see what kind of role hell take on there but for this week I think itll be primarily Holmes again New Yorks Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Washington Defense The Giants Duo was less than impressive running the ball Monday night against Philadelphia But the Redskins rush defense is a different story Washington ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id expect a similar distribution in carries as we saw Monday night Barber Dayne and Id expect both of them to have solid games against this horrible defense Dayne is clearly the Red Zone rusher though He had attempts Monday vs just Rushing attempt for Barber Barber did have passes thrown to him in the Red Zone New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Carolina Defense Curtis Martin ran well when he ran last week Its just that he didnt get to run enough Martin totaled yards on carries but he needs more than carries Hell get them this week against a Carolina defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Carolina was already thin at LB but with Hannibal Navies breaking his arm last week its even worse now This could be a big day for Martin San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Buffalo Defense Tomlinson is very good The Bills are not Buffalo ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If you can afford to bench Tomlinson you probably dont need any more help from here Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimores Terry Allen Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense Keep an eye on the injury reports here as Terry Allen suffered a sprained ankle last week and is iffy for Sundays game Jason Brookins filled in pretty nicely for Allen rushing times for yards ypc He did have a fumble though Jacksonvilles struggling and theyre not getting a lot of help from their defense They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Theyre only slightly better in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs ranking There were lots of rumors floating around about the Ravens trying to trade for a RB They apparently dont feel Allen Brookins are enough to get the job done Keep an eye on this through the week to see if Allen can go If you have to submit your lineups by Thursday Id be leery of either back though Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Detroit Defense The knock on Corey Dillon has always been his inconsistency He did little to quiet the critics Sunday with a carry for yard ypc day against the Bears Although you have to give the Bears defense credit theyre tough This week he faces a much softer Lions unit that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Im willing to discount last weeks performance as a testament to the Bears Dillon simply didnt matchup well with the tough inside defenders of Chicago and I expect him to fare much better here Denvers Mike Shanahan vs New England Defense Take your pick here The latest Terrell Davis news from Sports Illustrated is that he may be injured more than anyones letting on And now ESPNs John Clayton is reporting that Olandis Gary may get the start over Mike Anderson in an effort to shake up the offense Sheesh The Broncos are struggling offensively to get much going Theyll face a Patriot team on a major roll Although statistically theyre still giving up a ton of yards The Indy New England box score from last week was a strange one Indy loses but has total yards including rushing The Patriots rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and also rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs When Anderson ran last week he did pretty well gaining yards on carries ypc although he did have a fumble carries wont get it done for you though If I had to turn in a roster Thursday Id probably shy away from the whole situation if I could even though Id expect the Broncos as a team to run well on New England Detroits James Stewart Lamont Warren vs Cincinnati Defense Keep an eye on this one as James Stewart suffered an ankle injury and his status is uncertain for this weeks game Lamont Warren will go if Stewart cant Neither player did a lot against Tennessee last week Warren had yards on carries ypc Stewart had yards on carries ypc The Bengal defense is enticing though as they rank just in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Its likely a decision on wholl play may not come till later this week so understand this is a risky call here if you must decide now Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense How can you not start Jerome Bettis He ranks over the last weeks in Fantasy Points among RBs The Titans are improving their rush defense and now rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year though they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Bettis is on a roll and I wouldnt want to be in his way come Monday Night at their new stadium Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Dallas Defense Michael Pittman continues to run well and that shouldnt change against Dallas Dont forget about his receiving as hes rolled up total yards over the last weeks Dallas is pretty average on defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Thomas Jones did get carries and a TD last week but I think itll be primarily Pittman here Minnesotas Doug Chapman vs Tampa Bay Defense Against a very good Packer Defense last week Chapman rushed for yards on carries ypc This week he faces Tampa Bay which has fallen all the way to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre tougher in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank for the year Pittsburgh rolled up rushing yards against Tampa Sunday so they can definitely be run on One note of concern is that Jimmy Kleinsasser had Red Zone rushing attempts last week compared to just for Chapman Chapman showed a great nose for the endzone in college so lets hope that Red Zone distribution starts to change Tampa has the tough reputation but I wouldnt be afraid of this matchup at all New Orleans Ricky Williams vs St Louis Defense Over the last weeks Ricky Williams is the RB in Fantasy Points He starts this week for me regardless of the matchup St Louis ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Certainly the high powered Ram offense can take a RB out of the game but the numbers show that teams have had some success running on them Ill take my chances with Ricky Oaklands Charlie Garner vs Philadelphia Defense Tyrone Wheatley could play this week but Im doubting it I think itll be Charlie Garner trying to carry the load The Eagles have the tough reputation but they rank just in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Part of that is due to their very tough pass defense Oaklands coming off a bye week while Philadelphias coming off a short week following a Monday night game Dont forget the teams ties here Jon Gruden and Charlie Garner are both former Eagles Bottom line I like Grudens ability to be able to create some situations for Garner to shine Seattles Shaun Alexander vs Miami Defense The Miami defense has lost some luster ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre still tough though and having a healthy Zach Thomas will be a big plus Thomas is mobile and a hard hitter Alexander is the top ranked RB in the league over the last weeks with TDs in his games Not sure he can keep that pace but you almost have to start him this week St Louis Trung Canidate Marshall Faulk vs New Orleans Defense At this point it looks like Faulk may sit another week and Canidate gets the start again Coach Mike Martz is claiming he wants Faulk to be before returning Canidates stellar play allows him that luxury Although Canidate wont be surprising anyone after the huge game last week And he doesnt get to play the Swiss Cheese Jets again New Orleans is tough defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks but Id still roll the dice on Canidate if youre needing a home run Hes got that breakaway potential to score from anywhere He also had Red Zone rushing attempts which should put to rest any talk that hes not big enough to handle the goalline carries Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Minnesota Defense Warrick Dunn says the injured foot toe will bother him for a while but now hes got a hamstring injury to worry about He hopes to be able to go this weekend although he was ineffective last week against Pittsburgh rushing for yards on carries ypc That wont cut it The Minnesota defense is nothing special ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They come in at in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Both the Tampa Bay WRs Keyshawn Johnson and Jacquez Green are less than for this game and may even be unavailable stay tuned so the Bucs may be forced to run the ball The Bucs havent been scaring many people through the air as it was and this will let the defense stack against the run even more Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Chicagos Anthony Thomas James Allen vs San Francisco Defense Coach Dick Jauron said Tuesday he doesnt want to be a one back team and that even after Thomas incredible performance Sunday Chicago will still use a RB tandem He said theyll be going with the hot hand Its my guess youll see Thomas have the hotter hand again this week Last week he rolled for yards on carries ypc and a TD He should have had another TD as well getting tackled at the after a yard run San Francisco is tough against the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Although theyre just in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs I like Thomas here but be leery that Dick Jauron is saying James Allen will still see time Its important to note that last week was the first week that James Allen did not get a Red Zone opportunity And it was the first week that Anthony Thomas did get one The writing is on the wall and its my opinion that Jauron is trying to smooth feathers and keep Allen positive Miamis Lamar Smith vs Seattle Defense This could be a tough game for Lamar Smith Hes a between the tackles runner and the Seahawks may give him trouble DTs Chad Eaton and John Randle are a solid pair and MLB Levon Kirkland is tough Seattle ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They also rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Travis Minor could see more action as the Dolphins like his receiving abilities Smith is still a solid player but Im not excited about this matchup New Englands Antowain Smith vs Denver Defense Antowain Smith rushed for yards on carries ypc against a weak Colt defense Sunday Denver is much tougher ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Patriots are all about QB Tom Brady right now and Id expect him to stay the focus Smith will run just enough to keep the defense semihonest A decent matchup but certainly no cakewalk Philadelphias Correll Buckhalter Duce Staley vs Oakland Defense Tough to say for certain which back gets the bulk of the work but I think youll still see Buckhalter carry most of the load At least until Staley shows hes back and Staley had just carries Monday night but should start slowly working his way back into game shape It wont be easy against a tough Raider Defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Tennessees Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense George had been struggling Over the last weeks hes the th ranked RB Not what youd expect out of him The task doesnt get any easier this week against a very tough and aggressive Pittsburgh Defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs George is a power rushing RB who doesnt match up very well with the Pittsburgh defense thats built to stop the power game Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Buffalos Travis Henry vs San Diego Defense Henry is running hard but hes struggling to produce numbers worthy of your starting lineup The Offensive Line just isnt creating much for him to work with And hes not an ultra quick guy who can make something out of nothing Henrys best bulldozing through a hole thats opened and punishing tacklers but hes had little chance to do that I dont see this changing much against a tough San Diego defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs All Pro Linebacker Junior Seau is iffy for this game and that will certainly help Henry if Seau cant go Although I still dont like this matchup Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense Fred Taylor misses another game Like thats news Stacy Mack is no Fred Taylor and unfortunately theyll be facing a Baltimore defense thats as tough as ever despite their record The Ravens rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They also rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Avoid Mack unless youre in a real pinch On the subject of Taylor Im getting a lot of email and I honestly am not hearing any more than you apparently are or arent Jacksonville is keeping it close to the vest Theyre saying its possible hell play next week but thats just a guess at this point The injury appears to be very serious and its not looking too good Not a lot you can do at this point though if youre a Taylor owner as his trade values already hit rock bottom Hang on and hope for the best San Franciscos Garrison Hearst Kevan Barlow vs Chicago Defense Chicago continues to rise up the defensive charts with a stifling run defense Last week they held Corey Dillon down Over the last weeks they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game DTs Keith Traylor and Ted Washington do a great job of clogging up the middle while MLB Brian Urlacher is a proven run stopper The advantage for Hearst and Barlow over Dillon is that they run outside more often but still a very touch matchup Washingtons Stephen Davis New York Giants Defense Davis cant seem to find the endzone but he continues to run hard and pile up some yards Over the last weeks hes gathered total yards which is solid This looks like a tough week for him though as the Giants rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Davis is the kind of guy wholl likely go off when you least expect it but this doesnt look like a good matchup to me Thatll do it for the

<19739702.1075853090412.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-10-25 02:49:27,Footballguys Update Passing Game MatchupsHi Folks Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Chicagos Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense QB Jim Miller isnt flashy but he gets it done Losing WR Marcus Robinson was a huge blow though and theyll be hard pressed to pick up the slack Rookie David Terrell will see increased time as will Dez White Marty Booker is the other WR and he should be solid Of the bunch Terrell has the most talent but is by far the least experienced Look for him to grow up in a hurry San Francisco can definitely be thrown on as shown by their ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs The Bears will likely try to flex their new found rushing game muscle but I think itll come down to how well they can cover the loss of Marcus Robinson Its a good matchup Im just not sure if the Bears can take advantage of it Denver Passing Game vs New England Defense Brian Griese tries to rally his team against the suddenly dangerous Patriots New England ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks That may be just what the Broncos need Eddie Kennison is playing better and Rod Smith is facing double and triple teams yet still producing Ty Law is a solid Cornerback but Otis Smith on the other side is vulnerable Grieses shoulder is sore but hell play through it It looks like it may be an issue all season Minnesota Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Daunte Culpepper didnt put up the eye popping stats last week but the Vikings won a tough game against the Packers You could see a similar performance this week in this important game against Tampa Bay The Bucs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyve obviously been thrown on Randy Moss and Cris Carter are solid plays as is Culpepper I also like TE Byron Chamberlain to make some noise here Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Heres all you need to know about the Jaguar Pass Defense Rob Johnson looked pretty good against them last week and was only sacked times That says a lot The Jags rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they seem to be regressing Elvis Grbac is listed as Questionable with a rib chest injury and is no lock to start Randall Cunningham would go if Grbac cant After getting everyones expectations up WR Travis Taylor disappeared last week having only pass thrown his way Brandon Stokely had and Qadry Ismail had So its tough to say how itll play this week I really like Taylor but he sure came up small last week Shannon Sharpe is a good play like always and rookie TE Todd Heap should hopefully see action this week Carolina Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense QB Chris Weinke seems to be regressing a bit after a very solid start His interceptions last week were killers He faces a Jets team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so he could get back on track They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Muhsin Muhammad and Donald Hayes will face solid corners Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman The real damage for Carolina can be done with TE Wesley Walls whos always a factor Cincinnati Passing Game vs Detroit Defense New Flash Jon Kitna must be more consistent For better or worse the Bengals record seems to mirror his play Losing WR Chad Johnson hurt as Johnson brought a true deep threat to the table something the other WRs do not Darnay Scott and Peter Warrick are limited by Kitnas play and dont seem to be as active as they were earlier The Lions rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they can definitely be thrown on For the year Detroit ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so maybe there is hope for Kitna this week Kansas City Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense QB Trent Green should get a break Thursday night against a Colt defense that hasnt put much pressure on the QB sacks in the last games They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks DE Chad Bratzke is Questionable so that should help even more WR Derrick Alexander is getting back in the groove of things with a reception day for yards and a TD last week Chris Thomas will likely start but Snoop Minnis will see time too New England abused Cornerback David Macklin last week and the Chiefs should have similar results The Colts rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs As always TE Tony Gonzalez will be a huge part of the game New York Giants Passing Game vs Washington Defense The big buzz this week is that Coach Jim Fassell is rumored to be considering not starting WR Amani Toomer Remember last year Toomer was briefly demoted and he responded with a great finish Even if this happens I dont expect it to be a big deal as Toomer is clearly the Giants best option at WR QB Kerry Collins struggled with just yards last week against the Eagles but Philadelphia is on a different level The Redskins are ranked just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and the Giants should get back on track New York Jets Passing Game vs Carolina Defense The Jet passing game will be without WR Wayne Chrebet this week as he recovers from a concussion Kevin Swayne will likely get the start in his place and I think youll see a lot more of Matthew Hatchette too Testeverdes been ok but not great This offense is all about Curtis Martin though and I dont see that changing Although the passing matchup is enticing as the Panthers rank just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks The Carolina Linebacking Corps is in shambles so TE Anthony Becht might be a good play The Panthers rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs St Louis Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Start your Rams Yes New Orleans is solid but each one of these St Louis players is capable of winning your game for you this week Kurt Warner Torry Holt and Issac Bruce are must starts with AzZahir Hakim a likely starter for many teams Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Injuries are taking their toll on the Buccaneer WRs Both Keyshawn Johnson hip flexor and Jacquez Green groin are Questionable for this week That doesnt bode well for them or for QB Brad Johnson Minnesota ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so the opportunity is there if they can get healthy But right now its a tough call until you know more Id expect both to play but you dont know for sure If the WRs are limited thatll obviously drag Brad Johnsons numbers down Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Detroit Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Ive never been a Charlie Batch fan but hes making a believer out of me He blew up against the Titans Sunday with a TD Interception day The Bengal Defense has put up good numbers ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks On the flip side to that Rodney Heath and Robert Bean are out so the secondary could be ripe for Batch this week Lions WRs Germane Crowell and Herman Moore are gone but Johnnie Morton is ready to go Larry Foster will be the WR and dont count him out Morton cant catch every pass Morton has been averaging targets per game but thatll surely rise Detroit just signed WR Bert Emanuel so all their troubles are now over New England Passing Game vs Denver Defense Count me on the Tom Brady Bandwagon Hes done well against several different defenses both at home and on the road He plays a very similar game to fellow Michigan grad Brian Griese He doesnt dazzle you with physicals but he plays a solid heady game Dont know for sure but it wouldnt surprise me if his Dad were a coach He has that kind of game Chris Mortensen reported earlier this week that Drew Bledsoe may not be coming back this season because of his injury Terry Glenn is a question mark for this week His agent is crying again that mean old Bill Belichick made him hurt his hamstring Im so far over that If he plays he could produce Troy Brown will also see a ton of looks and you cant count out Mr Do Everything David Patten Denver ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs so I wouldnt be surprised to see Jermaine Wiggins make some noise New Orleans Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Like everyone else Im a little worried about Aaron Brooks He ranks just among QBs in Fantasy Points over the last weeks Things wont get any easier this week against a vastly improved Ram defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks The focus of the Saints is rightly RB Ricky Williams and Brooks simply isnt being counted on to carry the team WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are garnering most of the passes with Albert Connell getting a few looks TE Cam Cleeland is doing his Bubba Franks impression scoring on just about every pass he catches The Rams rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs so Cleeland might do some damage Philadelphia Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Donovan McNabb threw just enough to win Sunday afternoon Hell likely do the same against an Oakland defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Cornerback Charles Woodsons a shutdown corner and is as good as anyone in the game WR Todd Pinkstons wrist wasnt supposed to be any big deal but hes showing up on the injury report as Questionable Coach Andy Reid said he thought hed be good to for Sunday If Woodson lines up on James Thrash Pinkston could produce San Diego Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Buffalo at San DiegoThink theyll be any revenge factor brewing here Just a little Im guessing QB Doug Flutie takes his team against a Buffalo Defense thats actually been very solid against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Much of that can be attributed to games against Pittsburgh Jacksonville and the Jets Still though theyre decent defending the pass and will give Flutie some obstacles Jeff Graham is clearly the most active WR while theyre doing what they can to get TE Freddie Jones into the game San Francisco Passing Game vs Chicago Defense QB Jeff Garcias picked up where he left off last year Over the last weeks hes the rated QB in the league in Fantasy Points His rushing TDs lead the team Theyll face a stout defense in Chicago thats better suited for stopping the run than the pass The Bears rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks MLB Brian Urlacher is very tough on the mid range routes but look for the ers to exploit the Chicago Corners RW McQuarters and Walt Harris No corner matches up well with Terrell Owens and this week wont be any different JJ Stokes and Tai Streets will see action as well but make no mistake this team is about Garcia throwing to Owens Washington Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense Tony Banks to Rod Gardner What a great performance by the rookie WR last week Itll be tougher to repeat as the Giants are much more physical They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Gardner has seen passes thrown his way each game since week Michael Westbrooks numbers have been falling Pretty tough matchup for the young Gardner Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense The Arizona passing game is all about David Boston And rightfully so Cowboy Cornerbacks Mario Edwards and Duane Hawthorne cant matchup with Boston and the Cardinal running game with Michael Pittman will have the safeties creeping forward On the flip side Dallas ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and its hard to argue with the numbers Obviously theyre stopping teams somehow Jake Plummer should have time to throw as the Cowboys have only registered sacks in the last games Buffalo Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for Rob Johnson He did play much better last week Before I get too excited hes got a tough matchup this week with San Diego who plays pretty decent pass defense Plus you know the Chargers will be pumped up playing the Bills with all the ties there The Chargers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks WR Eric Moulds TE Jay Reimersma and FB Larry Centers will see the bulk of the passes from Johnson In an effort to save Rob Johnsons life I think youll continue to see the coaching staff rely heavily on the short passes to Reimersma and Centers Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense With Anthony Wrights knee troubles looks like Dallas will start Clint Stoerner or Ryan Leaf Ouch Although to be fair Ive always been a guy who felt Leaf still has a chance in this league Call me crazy I know WR Joey Galloway is questionable with a bad foot so thats a negative If Wrights unable to go Id probably shy away from all these guys until you see them perform Indianapolis Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense If you own any Colt players youve seen first hand the differences between real and Fantasy Football lately Marvin Harrison Peyton Manning and Edgerrin James turned in great Fantasy performances last week en route to the Colts getting spanked by the Patriots Go figure Theyll have a pretty tough matchup this week against Kansas City who ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Much of that ranking comes from the fact KC is so easy to run on Corners William Bartee and Eric Warfield will have their hands full with Harrison and Rookie Reggie Wayne Looks like WR Jerome Pathon will miss another game with a sprained foot Look for the Colts to take what the Chiefs give them running room for James Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Over the last two weeks its become very clear that the way to attack the Ravens defense is to spread the field with multiple WR sets Look for Jacksonville to do just that and for QB Mark Brunell to possibly focus a bit more on the shorter passing game WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are both solid players Theyll face a Raven defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre much more effective in stopping the run than they are the pass With Stacey Mack rushing the ball the Jags would just as well throw TE Kyle Brady might be worth a shot as Baltimore ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs Miami Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Jay Fiedler faces an improving Seattle defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Miamis had a week off to prepare WRs Oronde Gadsden and our Footballguy favorite Chris Chambers will see most of the passes although Cornerback Shawn Springs is getting back to form after his hamstring injury and will likely limit Gadsdens play Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense The Steelers are rolling but dont think Kordell Stewart has too much to do with it Id avoid pretty much everyone on this offense outside of Jerome Bettis and Kris Brown If you really have to reach WR Plaxico Burress is seeing lots of balls thrown his way and actually has more targets the last two weeks than Hines Ward Burress should be able to use his size to his advantage in the Red Zone Injured Cornerback Samari Rolle says he has a chance of playing Monday But bottom line is this team is all about Jerome Bettis and Defense Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Oakland Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense QB Rich Gannon and his Hall of Famers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown will take on one of the most aggressive pass defenses in the game Against Oaklands savvy veterans Im not certain unlimited blitzing is the best course of action Brown and Rice are guys who can find the open seam and fortunately Gannons a guy who can deliver the ball The Eagles rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks though so somethings gotta give Seattle Passing Game vs Miami Defense In one of the more controversial moves of the season Coach Mike Holmgren has awarded Matt Hasselbeck his job back Trent Dilfer goes back to the bench While hes there hell likely see Hasselbeck struggle against a tough Miami Defense Miami ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and Cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison are as good as any pair in the game Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Steve McNair looked almost like a real live NFL QB last week Although he still cant get the ball past his TE as Frank Wycheck rolled for yards Look for more of the same this week as the Steelers create trouble Pittsburgh is ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Their aggressive Linebacker play could create some opportunities for Wycheck and Erron Kinney to find some seams in the middle As usual the TEs are the best options here Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to infoterms

<4526385.1075853091740.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-10-22 18:19:21,Footballguys Update Week Upgrade DowngradeHi Folks Another wild week in the NFL Weve got Footballguy Scott Luebkes Week Upgrade Downgrade Waiver Wire Picks Before we get to that though let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear From our Message Boards wwwfootballguystalkcom One of our message board members was justifiably frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters My reply to him Dont be down on yourself Thats the nature of the game There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week You did what just about every one of us would have done Im guessing Its part of the game Is it frustrating Sure it is But its still part of the game In my local league last week I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks but not week Aargh Did it play out No it didnt I had guys on my bench who outscored him But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder it was the right call for me I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football You just have to take the best info you can assemble make your call and let the players do the rest Just like a real GM You can only do so much If you got beat because you didnt know Terry Glenn was out and you started him well thats your bad But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life and proven RBs Williams and Green did not well thats not your fault I promise you if you can predict things to that degree you need to quit your job and head to Vegas Control what you can control Bust your butt to know all you can know Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable youve done all you can do After that just enjoy the games Trust me youll be a better owner because of it Ok lets jump to Scotts report for this week Have a great week everyone Joe Upgrades QB Tom Brady Waiver Wire touchdown passes in the last weeks deserves an upgrade in my book More importantly Brady has yet to throw an interception this season When Bledsoe returns from injury the Patriots coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make Theres even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season Right now Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback QB Tim Couch The yardage numbers wont win any awards but the touchdowns in the last games is impressive Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league Keep in mind a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch However with the Browns offense improving he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future QB Doug Flutie The Flutie magic continues to strike Hes not the best fantasy quarterback but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy Flutie should be considered a top quarterback this season With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion passing yards and scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense RB Anthony Thomas The ATrain continues to ride into fantasy starting lineups Weve been hyping him for weeks and it appears hell be named the official starter in Chicago shortly With yards and a touchdown on Sunday can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup I think not RB Trung Canidate Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a filler total yards and touchdownsWOW At the very least hell see more action even when Faulk is back RB Jerome Bettis Bettis has rolled to consecutive yard games Look for this trend to continue With the Steelers defense playing excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers look for Bettis to have more good games as the season progresses RB Michael Pittman We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season With Pittman seeing of the carries and more importantly producing all looks good for Pittman owners Ive never been an advocate of starting Cardinals running backs though After his total yards and a touchdown performance now may be the time to deal Pittman RB Jason Brookins Waiver Wire Terry Allens ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs to become the teams starting running back Hes looked good running behind a pretty solid offensive line but his carries have been limited due to Allens presence Keep in mind the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline Right now Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice WR David Patten Waiver Wire Anyone who rushes passes and receives for a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade With Terry Glenn being bothered by a hamstring injury Patten made the most of his opportunity He has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays which is needed in the Patriots offense Grab him if you are in need of a receiver WR David Terrell Waiver Wire Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with catches for yards More importantly for his fantasy value Marcus Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season The Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears starting lineup If youre in need of a receiver Terrell is the best option in the free agent market if he is still available WR Keyshawn Johnson Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season but he is doing everything else Johnson is averaging catchesgame and appears unstoppable at times However he did suffer a hip flexor injury late in the game and appears questionable for this weeks game WR Johnnie Morton Morton continues to impress this season He has surpassed the yard mark times this season and scored touchdowns With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season Morton becomes the teams wide receiver Morton owners should be happy WR David Boston Plain and simple Boston is bigger faster and better than any defensive back on the field In his first games Boston is averaging receiving yardsgame Keep him in your lineup every week WR Jeff Graham With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson garnering a lot of attention the receiving corps is able to see plenty of open spaces downfield Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season and gained yards on Sunday With defenses focusing on Tomlinson look for Flutie to find Graham for more touchdown passes this season WR Rod Gardner Waiver Wire While Michael Westbrook appears invisible Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field yards and a touchdown with another score called back Gardner is starting to claim the title of best rookie receiver Grab him if he is available in your league Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game TE Bubba Franks Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease because All he does is catch touchdowns touchdowns in games If only he can start picking up yardage points TE Cam Cleeland Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase the total to scores this season With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his wide receivers in the red zone Cleelands value should remain high for a little while longer Downgrades QB Aaron Brooks Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers especially in the red zone With just touchdowns in his last games Brooks is in a minor slump Theres no need to jump off his bandwagon On the flip side an upturn in production is possible over the next weeks as New Orleans faces St Louis NY Jets San Francisco and Indianapolis But for now were a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week QB Elvis Grbac Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once again this week Without a consistent running game look for Grbacs struggles to continue For now Grbac is expected to be listed as questionable for this weeks game against Jacksonville QB Charlie Batch With yards and touchdowns many would think that Batch deserves an upgrade Well if the box scores were the only thing studied this would be the case However the season ending injury to Batchs receiving option Germane Crowell gives Batch a downgrade in my book With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season Batch must rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receiversnot a good sign QB Vinny Testaverde Testaverde was unable to get anything going against the Rams on Sunday With the Rams leading by a significant margin Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time All in all not a good sign for Testaverde owners Testaverdes yardage numbers are poor this season However he has thrown for multiple touchdowns in of his games this season RB Warrick Dunn Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the Steelers Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report this week With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town Dunns owners cant be very happy with this recent turn of events Joes email updates will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news RB Michael Bennett Chapman was able to rush for yards on carries during Sundays game versus Green Bay This is bad news for the unproductive injured Bennett With Bennett failing to clear the yard mark this season his starting job is in jeopardy Keep an eye on this situation RB James Stewart Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sundays loss to the Titans He was limited to yards on carries before leaving the game Expect him to be listed as questionable for this weeks game As more of a straight ahead runner Stewart may be able to play on the injury and be somewhat effective With this weeks game on astroturf the Lions may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to health Regardless any kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade RB Tim Biakabatuka Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for the season RB Terry Allen Allen was limited to yards on carries after suffering an ankle injury on Sunday Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen and looked decent If Allen misses any action Brookins may replace him as the teams starter with one good performance The Ravens are exploring trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline so the Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time RB James Allen Weve been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago Plain and simple Allen has been horrible this season With Thomas gaining yards on carries Allen will be relegated to spot duty RB LaDainian Tomlinson Tomlinson was limited to yards on carries and touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense It was bound to happen that a team would shut down Tomlinson Tomlinson owners should be happy that he received carries despite being ineffective Just a slight downgrade to show hes human Keep him in your lineup WR Marcus Robinson Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for the season WR Germane Crowell Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost for the season WR Terry Glenn Currently Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain that he suffered in last weeks practice He missed Sundays game and witnessed the David Patten Show With Patten showcasing his playmaking skills look for Glenns touches to be reduced when he returns from injury Previously Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense Glenn can post dazzling numbers but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season WR Darney Scott Scotts role in the Bengals offense has seemingly been reduced in the last few weeks After suffering a rib injury that forced Scott out of Sundays game Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a consistent basis With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented nd year wideout from Florida St Scott now appears to be the teams second option in the passing game WR Marvin Minnis Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense since week With Sylvester Morris out for the season Minnis looked ready to take over the role and produce quality numbers With Trent Green struggling at quarterback Minnis fantasy impact has been minimal at best If Minnis is a starter on your roster your receiving corps needs some serious help Waiver Wire QB Tom Brady touchdown passes in the last weeks deserves an upgrade in my book More importantly Brady has yet to throw an interception this season When Bledsoe returns from injury the Patriots coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make Right now Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback RB Richard Huntley Huntley has been named the teams starter after the season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka It was only a matter of time before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again With the Panthers facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week Huntley should pay instant dividends RB Doug Chapman Chapman was able to rush for yards on carries in replacement of the injured Michael Bennett With the unproductive Bennett suffering from an ankle injury Chapman will be given the chance to earn the teams starting running back job Grab him if he is available RB Jason Brookins Terry Allens ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs to become the teams starting running back Hes looked good running behind a quality offensive line but his carries have been limited due to Allens presence Keep in mind the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline Right now Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice WR David Patten Anyone who rushes passes and receives for a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade With Terry Glenn being bothered by a hamstring injury Patten made the most of his opportunity He has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays which is needed in the Patriots offense Grab him if you are in need of a receiver WR David Terrell Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with catches for yards More importantly for his fantasy value Marcus Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season The Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears starting lineup If youre in need of a receiver Terrell is the best option in the free agent market if he is still available WR Rod Gardner While Michael Westbrook appears invisible Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field yards and a touchdown with another score called back Gardner is starting to claim the title of best rookie receiver Grab him if he is available in your league Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game WR Larry Foster With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the season the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup Foster is a talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills If you are in a deep league and in need of receiver help give Foster a shot on your team Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to infoterms

NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Alex Van Pelt threw for yards and TDs with Interception last week He threw a ton of balls toward Eric Moulds although not many were caught Peerless Price is also still a prime target TE Jay Reimersma and RB Larry Centers will see plenty of short throws The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyve pretty much been weak all year defending the pass Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Itll be hard to imagine Quincy Carter leading many FF teams to Playoff victories this week If youve got to go with one Joey Galloway suddenly become Carters favorite target last week Go figure Just when you thought he was locking on Rocket Ismail Both guys are risks Even with Arizona ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Great matchup but I just dont have a lot of faith in these guys being able to take advantage of it Oakland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Yes Brett Favre and the Packers didnt do much against the Titans last week But in my opinion you just cant bench Rich Gannon Jerry Rice or Tim Brown Theyre just too good and are too liable to explode at any time The Titans rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so clearly people are throwing on them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Start your Raiders Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Hard to imagine but Kordell Stewart is carrying Fantasy Teams right now Hes been awesome and isnt showing any signs that I can see of letting up The one factor hed been missing he now seems to have in abundance Confidence Hines Ward wasnt a big factor receiving but hes a great bet Plaxico Burress made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising in the charts The Lions are fired up but still rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Start your Rams Warner Bruce and Holt are sure starters Yes its tough to guess which Ram WR will do well as Warner spreads the ball around But I dont see how you can have either of these guys benched as you could leave a ton of points on the table Carolina ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Cleveland Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Tim Couch evidently had been catching a lot of flak from Browns fans for not being a very accurate passer last week Seeing as how not one of the bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player or ref Id guess the fans might want to keep their day jobs Couch wasnt very effective last week with yards TDs and Interception Normally reliable WR Kevin Johnson came up small as well I still have faith in Johnson as hes shown too much this year to discount him over one game The Packers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Kansas City Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Trent Greens finally coming around Either that or hes just teasing us With the dominant running of Priest Holmes Green is finding room to throw Marvin Minnis and Derrick Alexander are doing well Tony Gonzalez isnt as involved as his owners would like but hes a sure starter in TE leagues The Chargers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Minnesota Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense The hits just keep rolling for Minnesota QB Todd Boumans thumb is causing serious worry Enough that theres talk that Spergon Wynn could get the start Stay tuned on this one Randy Moss has clearly decided to play lately and will wind up with season long stats thatll make all the non Moss owners wonder what all the Moss guys were complaining about early on Cris Carter is definitely taking a backseat to Moss lately The Jaguars rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Jets Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense The Jets are tough to call lately Testeverde threw for yards and did manage TDs But Laveranues Coles didnt do a lot Although Chris Bermans call of Laveranues Coles shopping for yards was classic on the Prime Time highlights Wayne Chrebet was more active and of course Anthony Becht caught the TD but not much else All in all a risky place for FF passing game material Curtis Martin should run wild on this bunch The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Philadelphia Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense The passing game lately has been Donovan McNabb throwing to Duce Staley Thats ok as long as they get the yards Todd Pinkston and James Thrash have been inconsistent Theyll face a er team thats been pretty soft lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tennessee Passing Game vs Oakland Defense I never thought Id be writing about the pass happy Titans but thats the case Steve McNair has been awesome lately and ranks as the QB in the league over the last games Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are starters in just about every league TE Frank Wycheck is producing like always The Raiders rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Atlanta Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Its tough to depend on Chris Chandler but last week he played very well throwing for yards and TDs Tony Martin seems to be coming on a bit We said we loved Brian Finneran and he scored Hes not on the field enough yet to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out there RB Bob Christian is an integral part of the passing game as well This week theyll face a Buffalo defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Baltimore Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Elvis Grbac managed TDs with just yards Sunday night Picking a receiver for the Ravens is as tough as ever with Ismail Stokely Taylor all in the mix TE Shannon Sharpe is the sure bet This week theyll face the Bengals ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Terry Allen should be more of a factor in this one as well Green Bay Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense I cant imagine benching Brett Favre right now He seems to get better as it gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games after losing to Tennessee Sunday Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder both should be ready to play The Browns have been tough lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Jacksonville Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Mark Brunell posted yards TD and Interceptions Sunday Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith were as active as usual Theyre two of the steadiest guys in the league Its surprising but Minnesotas been tough lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Miami Passing Game vs New England Defense The problem with Jay Fiedler is that when hes ugly hes really ugly If you started him Sunday you know what I mean yards TDs and Interceptions wont win Real or Fantasy Games for anyone Oronde Gadsden was injured to boot Gasden said hell be ready Sunday Chris Chambers still has tons of upside if youre ready to roll the dice New England ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Diego Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Doug Flutie threw Interceptions Sunday with TDs Another day like that and hell see Drew Brees finishing the game You might see Brees anyway as theyll want to start taking a look at their QB of the future Jeff Graham and Curtis Conway continue to play well Tim Dwight could miss another game due to his lung problem TE Freddie Jones is inconsistent but if you own him hes probably a starter for you Kansas City ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With yards Interceptions and TDs you can say at least Hasselbeck didnt do anything to hurt the Seahawks Darrell Jackson is the clear guy although Koren Robinson will see his share of passes The Giants rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Johnson threw an ugly game last week with yards TDs and Interceptions If a team finds a way to limit Keyshawn Johnson the passing game is gone Granted most teams have trouble keeping Keyshawn from getting his catches but the over reliance on one receiver severely restricts the offense in my opinion Warrick Dunn saw plenty of passes Sunday but it wasnt enough At this point Keyshawn is the only consistent starter in this passing game New Orleans ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks after the St Louis game Monday night For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Carolina Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Surely youre not down to Chris Weinke are you Even with a week to rest Im not excited about their prospects Muhsin Muhammad might be an option for some teams TE Wesley Walls just doesnt seem to consistently get on the same page as Weinke The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cincinnati Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Dont even go there Maybe Peter Warrick in a stretch if youre desperate but thats pretty much it This team is all about Corey Dillon Unfortunately the Ravens picked up on that as well They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks with passing yards allowed in games For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even so Id still avoid Detroit Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Mike McMahon led the Lions to the feel good story of the week Sunday as they beat the Vikings Hats off to them and their fans They kept playing hard Mike McMahon looked very good and definitely showed some flashes of talent with his scrambling ability He threw for yards with TDs but also Interceptions Johnnie Morton is the clear cut Guy but Scottie Anderson did well too The Steelers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can run on them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Start Aaron Brooks Like you need me to tell you that Joe Horn and probably Willie Jackson are starters in your league as well Looks like Cam Cleeland has taken over all of the work Boo Williams was seeing at TE These guys are hot Ricky Williams reportedly has a hairline fracture in one of his ribs but is expected to play You have to think this will at least throw a little more focus on the passing game though The Bucs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre tough For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Giants Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Collins has been up and down He did have TDs last week but only threw for yards Amani Toomer was the clear Guy with Ike Hilliard apparently hurting Ron Dixon got into the action with a TD but hes inconsistent The Seahawks rank a very solid in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Francisco Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense The ers showed Sunday they can win in different ways as they rode the legs of Garrison Hearst and the RB corps to victory Jeff Garcia did very little throwing for yards and a TD Hell likely be needed more this week Terrell Owens is still his clear cut go to guy Garcia could make the Eagles pay with their blitz happy defense Philadelphia ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Washington Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Tony Banks struggled last week throwing for yards TDs and Interceptions His WR corps of Westbrook and Gardner have been ok but not great lately TE Zeron Flemister did see several passes thrown his way again Hes worth a shot if youre in need of a TE The Bears have improved lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Jake Plummer played decent last week with yards and TD David Boston is a must start at WR For you guys desperate for a TE look at Twayn Mitchell who had catches for yards a TD You could do a lot worse Well see if he can keep that up The Cowboys rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so this will be no cakewalk Chicago Passing Game vs Washington Defense Jim Miller isnt carrying anyones FF Team lately Although his yards and TDs Sunday werent bad Marty Booker is still seeing a ton of balls thrown his way And Dez White is seeing action David Terrell makes the most of what he gets but hes not seeing a lot of passes This team is about Anthony Thomas and smashmouth football Theyll have occasional outbursts of big plays but primarily its Thomas The Redskins have been very good lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Indianapolis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense We got the predicted bounceback from Manning as he threw for yards and TDs with Interception Hes been up and down so lets see if he can keep it up Of course Marvin Harrison is the prime target but rookie Reggie Waynes seeing lots of passes too TE Marcus Pollard was very involved in the game plan last week as well The Jets rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tough matchup New England Passing Game vs Miami Defense Tom Brady continues his slide back to Earth He threw for yards TDs and Interception last week But the Patriots won and thats all they care about Troy Brown is being hurt by Terry Glenns return Brown Glenn and David Patten all seem to be seeing fairly equal number of opportunities The Dolphins are tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs

against Yes even after last weeks performance The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks Lets get to it Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense Stacey Mack played well last week rushing for yards on carries ypc Hes settling into the starting RB role pretty well Still very quiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume Macks going to keep his job With no playoff hopes it probably makes sense not to rush Taylor back Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense Curtis Martin ran hard last week He had yards on carries ypc plus he caught a couple of passes This might be his week though as the Colts are weak on defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If hes going to explode this is the week St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense Start Faulk End of story Hes the best player in Fantasy Football If it matters and it doesnt the Panthers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Faulks knee was described as puffy after the game but he insists hell be fine and play Although some are saying Trung Canidate will see increased time Hes still a must start in my opinion though Tennessees Eddie George Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense This one hurts Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars the Oakland game with their porous rush defense And then Skip Hicks comes in last week and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for yards on carries ypc and a score Granted those numbers are padded with a yard rush George is such a team player that he reportedly didnt mind Hicks staying in the game as he had the hot hand I think youll see George back this week in his regular role but Hicks could get the call at any time The Raiders have improved on defense Now they just rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Atlantas Maurice Smith Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense Maurice looked a little better or healthier this week but hes still underperforming He rushed times for yards ypc Sunday Bob Christian is clearly going to be more involved at RB He had rushes for yards ypc and a score Christian also tacked on yards receiving At this point Id say Christian deserves a look in larger leagues The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Washington Defense With carries last week for yards ypc I think its safe to say Thomas is back Hes a perfect fit for this conservative offense Plus the Bears defense looks like itll keep them in most games which keeps Thomas involved Hell face a Redskin defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense Its my opinion that Ahman Green owners should just forget about last week Green was held to just yards on carries by a surging Tennessee defense I see very little to make me think this wasnt an aberration This week hell face a softer Brown defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year Cleveland is ranked in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Fantasy Football owners traditionally have memories that last about days I personally am not letting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense Its too early to be talking about Edgerrin James being a product of the system but the truth of the matter is that no name Dominic Rhodes is tearing it up lately Hes had rushing yards over the last games Sunday he rolled for of them on carries ypc and his longest run was yards so its not like he padded the stats with a yarder He caught passes to boot Clearly hes playing at a high level right now and is a must start in most leagues The Jets were horrible early on against the run but have now improved to average ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Englands Antowain Smith vs Miami Defense You know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday when he rolled up yards on carries ypc He continues to be one of the better stories of Over the last weeks he ranks as the RB in Fantasy points per game Smith should have had a TD but went down at the This week hell face a Dolphin Defense thats been soft lately They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Orleans Ricky Williams Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense Williams had a sub par game Monday night and it does seem like Coach Jim Haslett has been looking the other way the last few games He only had carries Monday He did gain yards ypc so he did well when he was in there Some of that can be attributed to the Rams and their offense taking Williams out Although you cant ignore Deuce McAllister McAllister had catches for yards but just one carry The Bucs are nothing special lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Keep an eye on Tampas Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time last week with a shoulder injury Itd be a nice boost if hes less than New York Giants Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense Barber continues to steal the show from Ron Dayne Barber rushed times for yards ypc Dayne only had carries for yards Barber was also the Giants leading receiver with receptions I dont see that changing a lot Seattle is ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Franciscos Garrison Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense Garrison Hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league He ran for yards on carries Sunday ypc You have to be a little worried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both rushing TDs And both Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries Hearst will be a guy who runs up and down the field but it looks like coach Steve Mariucci has more faith in the other guys for the goalline The Eagles rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense Things are looking pretty bad for Michael Pittman owners As we commented earlier the carries allotted to Jones have been creeping up Last week it looked more like a full blown time share with Pittman running times for yards ypc and Jones totaling yards on carries ypc Clearly neither are any good but thats bad news for Pittman owners Of even more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like the short yardage red zone guy The Cowboys rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Its tough right now to put much faith in either guy though even with the favorable matchup Buffalos Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense Travis Henrys tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee Shawn Bryson will likely get the bulk of the work this week Bryson didnt do much Sunday running times for yards ypc He did catch passes Hell likely be better with a week of practice with the first unit The Falcons havent been anything special against the run lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense Emmitt Smith looked like the old Emmitt Smith Old as in version which means not very good He struggled to get yards on carries ypc and generally wasnt a factor Hes an up and down player so realize your taking a chance with him The Cardinals arent much on defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Miamis Lamar Smith vs New England Defense Lamar Smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be effective He only rushed times Sunday for yards ypc That wont get it done Travis Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the Dolphins will stay with Smith for now New England ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Pittsburghs Chris FuamatuMaafala Jerome Bettis Amos Zereoue vs Detroit Defense Amos Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with yards on carries ypc But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for this weeks game FuamatuMaafala ran hard but had little room to move gaining yards on carries ypc And finally Jerome Bettis is in the mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this weeks game Obviously theyre being very careful to preserve him for the playoffs Well try to stay on this story this week for you The Lions are surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense Tomlinson struggled a bit last week with just yards on carries ypc He did add yards on catches Hell face an improved KC defense this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Seattles Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense Its been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with Ricky Watters broken ankle Alexander is back in the saddle as the Guy Look for him to pick up where he left off Last week he rushed for yards on carries ypc plus a TD The Giants have been pretty average lately in stopping the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense Stephen Davis played well last week with yards on carries ypc He was one of the few bright spots for Washington This week he faces a tough but beatable Bear defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Baltimores Moe Williams Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense You know its not good when Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing yards and Elvis Grbac leads the team in rushing TDs But thats what happened Sunday against the Steelers I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the Steelers have a real defense yet Moe Williams logged yards on carries ypc and Terry Allen made a less than smashing debut with yards on carries you do the math Tough to say how itll be split this week but youd have to think Allen will see more time The Bengals arent as good as Pittsburgh but theyre very good ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tough matchup especially since its not yet clear how the carries will be split Clevelands James Jackson Jamel White vs Green Bay Defense Watch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome ankle again He could be ok but its not clear early this week If he cant go Id expect youll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than his share of mistakes Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable Packers who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense We had Holmes ranked last week Im guessing youll see more sites follow our lead and raise him up the charts as well He had a monster game again with yards on carries ypc plus the score Hes a must start against pretty much any defense This week hell face a San Diego team ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Still though I wouldnt let that stop me Do keep an eye on his health this week as hes nursing a sore groin that might limit him Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense Outside of Indianapolis I dont know that theres been a more disappointing than Minnesota Or one tougher to predict each week You get fired up on Michael Bennett and then he cools off Last week he was back to his early season workload with only carries He did gain yards ypc so when he ran he did fine With him its a numbers game Give him enough carries and eventually hell break one But opportunities wont do it And hell face a very tough Jacksonville defense thats been hot lately They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Oaklands Charlie Garner vs Tennessee Defense Charlie Garner had his usual productive day with yards rushing on carries ypc plus another yards receiving The big news was Tyrone Wheatley not getting a carry Looks like Zack Crockett is back in at the goalline Although that can change at any moment The Titans shut down Ahman Green last week so thats a worry They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Philadelphias Duce Staley vs San Francisco Defense Staley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions in the passing game He rushed times for yards Sunday ypc He also had fumbles But on the bright side he caught passes for yards Theyll find the going a little tougher this week against San Francisco ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs New Orleans Defense Youll go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will do anything week to week Dunn only had carries for yards ypc and Alstott only managed rushes for yards ypc Dunn was heavily involved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but thats tough to count on Theyll face a New Orleans defense thats likely smarting from the Rams defeat They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Carolinas Richard Huntley vs St Louis Defense Huntley should be rested after the bye week Unfortunately rest wont make him any more talented The Rams rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this isnt looking good Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense Its strength against strength this week with Dillon facing the Ravens If you can imagine it the Bengals will be hurting without Akili Smith at QB That means Dillon is the whole offense and you can bet the Ravens will be geared up for it On a forward looking note it doesnt get any easier for Dillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon If your trade deadline hasnt passed Id consider dealing him The Ravens rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but I think theyre better than that They rank for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Detroits James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense James Stewarts hip injury may not be as bad as feared He had a solid game in their first victory last week rushing for yards on carries ypc The awful news this week is that hes playing Pittsburgh The Steelers are dominating offenses right now ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to follow Joe Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from

let the world know about it Weve got our Wall of Champs up and running and waiting for you Check it out here wallcfm You can add your team here addwallcfm Theres not much better than flaunting your success in front of your league members Enjoy Correction In the rushing Matchups I just sent I mentioned Stacey Mack playing the Raiders last week Obviously I meant the Vikings as I wrote about in the week matchups Thanks Hi Folks Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Jeff Garcia may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Brett Favre Garcias your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Jake Plummer came up small last week with just yards against a hot Dallas pass Defense Surprisingly David Boston was a non factor with just yards Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so theres nothing to worry about Carolina ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Tim Couch threw for yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was the th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning McNair and Garcia Clearly the matchup helped him out Kevin Johnson as usual was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way The Titans have been awful lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Again some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide Im not saying Couch will have a great game Check the cheatsheet rankings for where we have him What Im saying is that he has a great matchup here against the Titans whove struggled against the pass all year Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Jay Fiedler exploded for yards and a TD last week Finally Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with yards on receptions He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok this week TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away He rolled up yards and TDs with Interceptions against Indy Sunday Wayne Chrebet was the primary WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action TE Anthony Becht produced another TD The Bills rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Kurt Warner had an off day for him with just yards and TDs Of course hes a must start every week The trouble with him is he spreads the ball around so well its tough to predict which WR will see action but Id have a very hard time benching guys like Holt Bruce or even Proehl Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but hes saying hes ok The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Marty Booker catching yards worth of passes isnt as remarkable until you realize QB Jim Miller only threw for yards I guess that makes Booker the WR Hes clearly the favored option This team is all about Anthony Thomas and their defense though so Im not too excited about any of these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup The Lions rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Brett Favre made the most out of yards throwing for TDs last week Hes too good to sit against anyone Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was earlier this year The Vikings rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Indianapolis Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Manning was back on track again with yards TD and Interceptions last week The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is hes still one of the leagues best QBs Marvin Harrison was incredible catching nearly everything in his sight The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Remember Chris Weinke rolled over them last week For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game Its funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just yards but thats whats happening Hes spoiled us Im not worried about him as along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown theyre still one of the better passing units in the game Charlie Garner is a nice target too This week theyll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Brad Johnson put together a great game with TDs and Interceptions on yards Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of him I dont see many other viable FF options Johnson to Johnson is the name of this passing game Baltimore ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Weinkes yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams were ranked as the passing defense over the last weeks going into last week Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee The Cardinals rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Brian Griese should be back and ready to go Gus Frerotte is out for the year so Jarius Jackson will be the guy Rod Smith is the only receiver of note and hes a guy you can never count out The bye week helped and hes reportedly feeling better than he has in a while Oakland has struggled lately on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Brunell had a Brunelllike day last week with yards and a TD Jimmy Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just about any league The Chiefs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Trent Green put together a decent day with yards TD and Interceptions Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander did very little Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as his owners would like to see Hes still a must start for TE leagues The Jaguars rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call The Vikings have imploded If Bouman starts its much better news for Moss If Wynn starts Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter because it couldve been his last game in Minnesota Honestly its tough to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB WRs are rarely a sure thing The Packers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now Good for Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb James Thrash and Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they werent too effective Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick a WR The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up TDs last week and yards Theres serious MVP talk about him and deservedly so WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any team Burress in particular is coming on lately The Bengals are tougher than many realize against the pass lately They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Doug Flutie was awful early but made a great recovery to finish with yards and TDs with no Interceptions Theres a lot of talk about letting Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we wouldve seen him last week if that was the case Either way Fluties probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues Of the WRs Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action as well The Seahawks rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Matt Hasselbeck hasnt carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt itll start now Hes still a below average player WRs Koren Robinson and Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved in the passing game as well The Chargers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Tony Banks threw for yards last week in a tough game with Chicago Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes thrown their way He only caught a couple but TE Zeron Felmister saw passes thrown his way You could do a lot worse for a TE Plus hes got a cool name The Saints rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Van Pelt put together a yard TD passing game last week As usual Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly This week the Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense I cant imagine youre in contention in week with many of these guys on the roster Quincy Carters given me very little to make me think hell do much of anything Of course for the gamblers Rocket Ismail or Joey Galloway can make something happen with just one throw but theyre definite risks San Francisco is ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but its still very clear hes a rookie QB Granted hes got talent and potential but hes still very green Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver Thats not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could continue The Bears rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last week but thats what happened Aaron Brooks had TDs late as the Saints tried to rally from a big deficit Stats are stats though and Brooks owners will take them any way they can get them Joe Horn and Willie Jackson saw tons of action With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again Boo Williams is back as the TE so thats good news The Redskins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week He threw for yards and TD Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too The Eagles have cooled lately where they rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Their blitzing style can cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins experience should help him Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than He managed yards TD and Interceptions Derrick Mason is still the primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying something This week theyll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last week throwing for yards and TDs against Buffalo Terance Mathis Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games As you know though these guys are very inconsistent This week theyll face a Miami Defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense He threw for yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions Qadry Ismail is the preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an impact The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense You pretty much have to avoid all these guys Jon Kitna threw for yards and Interceptions His most newsworthy accomplishment was a sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson Peter Warrick was benched for fielding a punt on his own yard line Warrick should start this week They teased us early but these are clearly still the Bengals Pittsburgh ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Garcia only had yards and TD although he was very close on another but hes still a must start in my book Hes too good and has too many weapons Terrell Owens is of course a starter but JJ Stokes or Tai Streets could be worth a look TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in the passing game Dallas ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyve been tough For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tough matchups but I dont see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless youre just loaded See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see these guys ranked Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is

Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against Yes even after last weeks performance The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Carolina Defense After a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones Michael Pittman seemed to clearly be the prime RB here last week He rushed times for yards ypc plus a TD Thomas Jones on the other hand only had carries for yards The Panthers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this week For the year Carolina ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Atlantas Maurice Smith Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense Probably the strongest criticism of Smith you could offer is that hes losing time to Rodney Thomas Smith was ineffective again last week but did score the cheap TD He ran times for yards ypc Thomas had yards on carries ypc and did bring a spark Smith injured his toe and even though its not believed to be serious its hard to put much faith in him with Thomas coming on This week theyll face a Dolphin defense thats been soft lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Make sure to understand I dont have much faith in either of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank them Its just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run Carolinas Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week against a tough St Louis defense so its tough to count him out He posted yards on carries ypc plus a score This week he gets a much softer defense in Arizona that Emmitt Smith ran over last week The Cardinals rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Detroit Defense Thomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with yards on carries ypc Clearly hes the kind of tough back this team wants yet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder This week hell likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense Ahman Green bounced back as expected and proved why hes one of the leagues elite backs He rolled up yards on carries ypc He did have a yarder thrown in there He did leave with some breathing problems but he is expected to be ok this week Watch to make sure though This week hell face a Viking team that looks like theyve rolled over The Vikings rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs It doesnt always play out in real life but on paper it doesnt get much better than this Miamis Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense Again Lamar Smith was weak rushes for yards ypc and a big fumble But the Dolphins dont seem too excited about going with anyone else so theres always that chance for a cheap TD sort of like with Atlantas Maurice Smith I dont have much faith in him but this week hell face the soft Falcon defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and let the Bills run wild on them last week For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to like the matchup Check the cheatsheets to see exactly where we rank him New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Buffalo Defense Martin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with yards on carries ypc Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Indianapolis Defense Yawn Start Faulk He rolled up yards on carries last week ypc Best player in the game yada yada Hes the man If it matters to you and it shouldnt the Colts rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Denvers Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense Terrell Davis jumps back in the fray after a week of rest Oaklands defense has improved from awful to just bad over the last few weeks They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Oakland allowed Tennessees Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for yards last week so they are getting better Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Kansas City Defense We caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack in the lock column against the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another yard day He rushed times for yards ypc plus TDs Of course just to make you Mack owners nervous Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that Fred Taylor could see action this week or next tuonlinestoriesjaghtml I personally dont see it this week but with this season you never know Kansas City ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Orleans Ricky Williams vs Washington Defense Williams owners like me groaned when the Saints fell behind so early last week Williams was effectively taken out of the game Although truthfully hes been less and less a factor lately regardless of the score He ran for yards on carries ypc and caught passes for yards Thats pretty small This week hell face the Redskins who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tennessees Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense As weird as it sounds Eddie George will get the carries this week by default as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and wont see action The Browns rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimores Terry Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense Allen looked solid last week with yards on carries ypc plus a score He showed little ill effects of being off and actually may have benefited from the rest This week hell face a resurging Buc defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Thats up from last week For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Buffalos Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense As you know Bryson went wild last week rushing for yards on carries ypc plus scores He also tacked on yards on receptions Bryson did have a yard run which padded the stats a little but they all count Henry will likely sit again giving Bryson another start The Jets rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Giants Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense Neither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing times for yards ypc and Dayne only rushing times for yards ypc and a score Barber of course is more active in the passing game This week theyll face an Eagle defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense So much for that rookie wall Tomlinson rushed times for yards ypc last week Clearly hes the primary focus of the offense San Diego has a bye in week thats not really fair is it so this is the last game Drew Brees could see some action which probably means Tomlinson will be even more the focus if thats possible The Seahawks rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs San Franciscos Garrison Hearst Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense Hearst had a solid but not great game last week with yards on carries ypc Kevan Barlow carried the ball times for yards ypc Barlow also caught passes Hes creeping into Hearsts time This week theyll face a Cowboy Defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tampa Bays Mike Alstott Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense Its tough to predict too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly the featured RB last week rushing for yards on carries ypc with a score Warrick Dunn had rushes for yards ypc and added yards receiving plus a TD This week theyll face a Baltimore defense thats bark is worse than its bite lately They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs That just means that lately theyve given up a lot of yards The Tampa backs have been very up and down so be leery Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Clevelands Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense Jamel White prompted lots of wheres he been comments from the Brown faithful last week as he rolled up yards on carries ypc With James Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable it looks like the Browns will continue to utilize White Hell face a tough Defense this week in Tennessee that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dallas Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense Smith is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with yards on carries ypc He ran pretty well after a slow start and being totally and repeatedly shut down at the goalline Hes clearly just an average to below average back at this point in his career He does look like hell be able to hold off Troy Hambrick though The ers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dont discount the fact Smith is going for another yard season Of course with Quincy Carter at QB Id give it to Emmitt too Detroits Lamont Warren James Stewart vs Chicago Defense James Stewart reinjured his troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren came in and played well rushing times for yards ypc against a super tough Pittsburgh team Although he did get of those yards on one run The going isnt much easier this week against the Bears who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Keep an eye out this week to see whether Stewart or Warren will play Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs St Louis Defense Rhodes put together another excellent game last week against the Jets with yards on carries ypc with score He also tacked on yards on receptions He did have fumbles though This week hell face a tough Ram defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Although it should be noted they let Carolinas Richard Huntley run for yards and a TD on them last week so its not like theyre invincible Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Green Bay Defense Bennett suffered last week from the same problem hes had most of the year He just didnt get enough carries to make a difference Although one could argue that after producing just yards on the carries he was given ypc he didnt deserve any more Bennetts a percentage guy thatll be shut down for a while and then eventually break one long Its just that most teams cant afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett to get going This week hell face a Packer team ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the season they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Philadelphias Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense Duce Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it doesnt matter as hes clearly the Eagles receiver Last week he rushed times for yards ypc But he caught passes for yards This week hell face the Giants who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks More importantly for Staley they rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis Chris FuamatuMaafala vs Cincinnati Defense Coach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and says hell play if hes healthy Tough to say wholl get the call but one has to think that if he plays Bettis will be used just enough to keep him fresh The Steelers are winning without him have a very beatable opponent in Cincinnati this week and dont want to jeopardize their playoff situation where they know theyll need Bettis Plus the Bengals rush Defense is tougher than many think They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Seattles Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense Alexander looked to be making a statement that he should have been the guy all along with yards on carries ypc and a score plus another yards receiving with a TD Hell face the Chargers this week that rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Washingtons Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense Davis was held pretty much in check against the Bears last week with yards on carries ypc He did get the score though Hes clearly the prime weapon here How much would YOU depend on Tony Banks This week he faces a Saints defense thats been tough lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense Dillon ran well against the overhyped Raven rush defense As the numbers showed in the week matchup info Baltimores been nothing special against the run lately They were ranked last week for Dillon and this week they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Sometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation This week though the Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers Pittsburgh ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs This is a MUCH tougher matchup than last week against the Ravens Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Jacksonville Defense Holmes had a on off day for him with only yards on carries and yards receiving Hell be fine Tony Richardson stole another cheap TD Richardsons a gamble as he wont likely get many yards even on a good day but hes a threat for a short TD The Jaguars have been tough lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id still consider Holmes a must start in most leagues but this is a tough matchup Oaklands Charlie Garner Tyrone Wheatley Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense Charlie Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately he didnt run enough He had yards on just carries ypc And most of those were between the s Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley both saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will do anything The Broncos rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so itll be a touch matchup Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to

workhorse on the ground Sunday but didnt have a lot to show for it He ran times for yards ypc He did score on a receiving TD Hell face a weak Cleveland defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Arizona Defense Stephen Davis looked great rushing for yards on carries ypc and the score He left with a knee tweak but it doesnt look to be serious KiJana Carter played great after Davis left The Cardinals rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Buffalos Shawn Bryson Travis Henry Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense Bryson ran wild again rushing times for yards ypc Sammy Morris spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson is clearly the man here Its possible Henry could see action so keep an eye on this one through the week The Dolphins have fallen down to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense Emmitt looked very solid again rushing for yards on carries ypc although he failed to score He needs a little over yards to get for the season so you can bet hell be gunning for that The Lions rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New York Giants Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense Barber saw more action with carries and yards ypc but

didnt do much Sunday rushing times for yards ypc He ll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense Start Faulk The question will be of course how much he plays but it was pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play Trung Canidate could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went nuts Id say youll get at least a half maybe much more out of Faulk and half of Faulk is worth more than most backs The Falcons rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear cut RB role Thomas Jones steps in with carries Pittman rushed times for yards ypc which was bolstered by a yarder Jones ran for yards on carries ypc This was Carolina though This week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year

Bills ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing times for yards ypc Hell face a Baltimore defense thats numbers don t back up its reputation this week they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year

Philadelphia Defense Tampas OneTwo punch continues to work Alstott had yards on carries ypc and Dunn carried the ball times for yards ypc Alstotts been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more involved in the passing game This week theyll face an Eagle defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon showed again he can run on any defense He had yards on carries ypc against the Steelers Hell face the Titans this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so it won t get much easier They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Detroits Lamont Warren James Stewart

there The Cowboys rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense Green was shut down on the ground with just yards on carries ypc although he did score Go figure Hes still too good to sit in my opinion This week hell face the Giants ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so its a tough matchup although I think Id start Green unless you really have a solid alternative Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense Again Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for yards on carries ypc with a score Hell face the Broncos this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Broncos are definitely surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense Mack went off last week with yards on

Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense Staleys receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he paid the price He only rushed times for yards ypc and was shut down receiving with just receptions for yards This week hell face a surging Buc defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tennessees Eddie George vs Cincinnati

they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Atlantas Maurice Smith vs St Louis Defense Again Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD He managed just yards on carries ypc Bob Christian stole carries where he gained yards ypc Theyre both a gamble against a tough Ram defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Carolinas Richard Huntley vs New England Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining yards on carries ypc He just didnt get enough carries for this awful Carolina team That wont get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in

<6794556.1075861999872.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-12 17:55:16,Footballguys Update Week Upgrades DowngradesHi Folks Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this weeks Upgrades Downgrades and Waiver Wire Picks Have a great week Joe Upgrades By Scott Luebke QB Brett Favre Favre continues to prove why he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time Unlike the last few seasons Favre remains healthy and continues to put up consistent fantasy numbers on a weekly basis With Bill Schroeder returning from an ankle injury Favres stock continues to rise QB Aaron Brooks The inconsistent season of Aaron Brooks continues to excite and disappoint fantasy owners With passing yards and touchdowns Williams dropped a third touchdown against the ers Brooks continues to be deemed a top fantasy quarterback Keep him in your lineup and live with the ups and downs Brooks could put up explosive numbers during any game QB Donovan McNabb McNabb continues to impress and should only get better with the development of his receiving crew With a favorable schedule for the remainder of the season look for McNabb to carry fantasy teams towards the playoffs He has started to develop a quality connection with the speedy James Thrash Also McNabb is starting to develop a good balance between staying in the pocket and scrambling for the first down Look for these extra rushing yards to provide added scoring as we head towards the fantasy playoffs QB Jay Fiedler Fiedler has topped the yard barrier in each of the last games while finding the end zone times With the development of talented rookie Chris Chambers Fiedler has found a big play threat that should electrify the Miami offense With a favorable schedule for the remainder of the season look for Fiedler to post solid numbers QB Jeff Garcia Garcia has become a mainstay in the upgrades section Add another touchdowns to his total RB Marshall Faulk Hes back RB Fred Taylor Taylor is nearing his return to the lineup He should be able to get a good tune up before the fantasy playoffs Lets hope he stays healthy RB Shaun Alexander Wow rushing yards and touchdowns make a good case to remain the starter upon Ricky Watters return from injury Will Holmgren be able to justify the benching of the teams running back of the future I meanrunning back of the present Sorry Ricky but your time appears up in Seattle RB Duce Staley Staley scorched the Vikings for total yards and a touchdown It appears that Staley is now at health Keep in mind Staley has always been a streaky producer throughout his career With the Eagles offense looking sharp Staley will most likely have longer hot streaks than cold streaks RB Curtis Martin Martin continues to look good on the season After being mired in a mini scoreless slump Martin totaled touchdowns against the Chiefs on Sunday With the winter weather approaching quality running backs like Curtis Martin will become more important RB Dominic Rhodes With Edgerrin James expected to miss the next games and possibly the remainder of the season Rhodes steps into the starting role Rhodes suffered a shoulder injury that forced him out of the first half on Sunday However he was able to return in the second half Look for Rhodes to be a productive back in the second half of the season This upgrade is not based on production but rather opportunity RB Jerome Bettis The Bus continues to roll in yardage leagues but he has been rather disappointing in scoring leagues With just two touchdowns on the season basic scoring league owners must be frustrated with Bettis Dont worry Bettis will get a fair share of touchdowns in the second half of the season RB Mike Anderson The knee injury to Terrell Davis will make Mike Anderson the teams starter once again RB Maurice Smith Smith continues to look strong as the feature back for the Falcons Despite being held scoreless in the last weeks Smith continues to post quality yardage numbers and yards When the Falcons become more efficient in the red zone with the passing game Smiths touchdown numbers will increase RB Antowain Smith consecutive yard games have Antowain Smith owners jumping for joy and this deserves an upgrade Heck if Antowain Smith makes anyone jump for joy its gotta be good Heck the Patriots offense is producing and the defense is maintaining quality field position If the New England defense continues to play well and keep the Patriots in the lead Smith will have a quality finish to the season WR Marvin Harrison Harrison scorched the Dolphins for yards and touchdowns on Sunday With Edgerrin James likely out for the remainder of the season Harrison and the passing game will become the focal point of the offense The return of Jerome Pathon should keep the pressure off of Harrison WR David Boston consecutive yard receiving games and pure dominance at the wide receiver position Once again I will proclaim Boston as the best young receiver in the game of football If the Arizona offense improves efficiency Bostons touchdown numbers will rise dramatically WR Willie Jackson Slick Willie appeared invisible for a few weeks but Sundays catches for yards deserves the upgrade Because of his effectiveness look for Brooks to find Jackson more often In addition Brooks appears to be showing signs of improvement and poise in the pocket WR Chris Chambers Chambers showed his big play potential on Sunday and scored his first two touchdowns on the season Keep in mind Chambers will most likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this season However he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues WR Bill Schroeder Schroeder returned from an ankle injury and scored a touchdown in addition to his yards receiving Before his injury Schroeder was one of the most consistent producers at the wide receiver position Look for that trend to continue as long as he remains healthy WR Joe Horn Horn has started to show signs of why he was drafted so high this season With games of and yards to go along with touchdowns Horn is making patient fantasy owners very happy Keep him in your lineup WR Terrell Owens yards receiving and more touchdowns News flashOwens is really good WR James Thrash Thrash is assuming the role of receiver in Philadelphia and thats a good thing with a quality talent like Donovan McNabb at quarterback more touchdowns on Sunday increase Thrashs total to touchdowns on the season With Todd Pinkston struggling on the opposite side McNabb continues to look in Thrashs direction more often Downgrades QB Brian Griese Griese has been looking good but the ankle injury to Rod Smith has me worried a little bit Smiths ankle is something that needs to be watched especially with Eddie Kennison claiming that he wants to retire If Rod Smith is unable to play it may be wise to bench Griese if you have a viable backup option QB Trent Green Well a healthy Derrick Alexander would have made this a better season for Green With two consecutive games held under yards Green once again is downgraded With a thin receiving crew at his disposal Green will continue to be a shaky start If Alexander can return healthy after the bye week Green could produce quality numbers down the stretch For now start someone else at quarterback QB Rob Johnson A broken clavicle will keep Johnson out for weeks QB Ryan Leaf Leaf is not the answer to your fantasy teams problems If youre starting Ryan Leaf your fantasy team must be really bad Time to play for next year if youre in a keeper league QB Michael Vick Vick remains a year or two away from becoming a viable fantasy quarterback option He continues to struggle with reading the defense On a good note Vick threw for his first touchdown pass this past Sunday RB Edgerrin James The knee injury to James appears to be more serious than first thought The knee injury will keep James out for another two weeks and possibly the remainder of the season Make sure you have Dominic Rhodes on your roster This is a big blow to Edgerrin James owners RB LaDainian Tomlinson Tomlinsons struggles continue as opposing defenses have learned to shut down the Chargers running game After a glorious start to the season Tomlinson has been on a gradual slide Its only a matter of time before Tomlinson returns to the upgrades list Dont bail out on Tomlinson just yet RB Terrell Davis Davis injured his left knee on Sunday and will likely miss the next two games and possibly more Davis will have arthroscopic knee and will miss Sundays game against Washington and most likely the following weeks game against Dallas With the fragility of Davis lately this is not a good sign RB Lamar Smith Smith continues to struggle He has been held under yards for the th consecutive week With Travis Minor starting to take a few carries away from Smith Smith owners need to start worrying a little bit This weeks game against the Jets could help signify the remainder of the season for Smith RB Travis Henry Henry and the Bills running game continue to struggle Henry has been held under yards in each of the last games Keep him on your bench until he begins to produce WR Muhsin Muhammad Muhammad showed signs of life on Sunday with yards receiving Keep in mind the majority of this yardage was gained while the Rams held a commanding lead With Matt Lytle at quarterback no Panthers receiver should be started WR Eric Moulds catches for yards and an injury to the starting quarterback Moulds is currently sharing the title of most disappointing fantasy receiver with Randy Moss this season Yuck WR Darnay Scott Scott suffered a concussion in Sundays game against the Jaguars and was shut out on the day Concussions sometimes linger with receivers so this deserves a little bit of watching He is expected to be ready for next weeks game WR Rod Smith Smith suffered an ankle injury in Sundays game versus the Chargers It is not yet known whether the injury will keep Smith out of action but it will most likely keep him from performing at his normal This situation bears watching Joes email updates will keep you updated on this one WR Todd Pinkston Pinkston continues to struggle and it may be only a matter of time before he loses the starting role to Freddie Mitchell If you are a Pinkston owner it may be a wise decision to grab Mitchell if you are in a deep league Waiver Wire Keep in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and team leagues QB Alex Van Pelt With Rob Johnson out for weeks Van Pelt will step in and be given a chance to perform Keep in mind Van Pelt scorched the Jets for yards and touchdowns earlier this season He may be worth a shot QB Drew Bledsoe Bledsoe has been cleared to play However Tom Brady is expected to remain the starter Make sure you have Bledsoe on your team if you have Brady RB Dominic Rhodes The primary backup to the injured Edgerrin James He will be a quality option for the remainder of the season in the Colts offense James owners should already have Rhodes on their roster RB Travis Minor Minor displayed his explosive running skills against Indianapolis on Sunday Hes gradually taking a few carries away from Lamar Smith With Smith struggling Minor could see his role expand Minor is very similar to Warrick Dunn RB LaMont Jordan Jordan has gotten carries in the last weeks Because of his effectiveness hell continue to see carries per week If Martin befalls injury Jordan would be explosive RB Troy Hambrick Hambrick continues to produce with the absence of Emmitt Smith It is not apparent how long Smith will be out of action but Hambrick is a good option for right now WR Chris Chambers Chambers showed his big play potential on Sunday and scored his first two touchdowns on the season Keep in mind Chambers will most likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this season However he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues WR Keith Poole With Rod Smith injured ankle and Eddie Kennison pondering retirement the Broncos will need Poole to enter the starting lineup and produce Poole is not the flashiest receiver but he has the ability to be productive in the Denver offense WR Freddie Mitchell Mitchell continues to see more and more action in the Eagles offense and deserves consideration for a second half pickup Grab him especially if you are in a keeper league WR Jerome Pathon Many fantasy owners dropped Pathon a few weeks ago but he is healthy now With the loss of Edgerrin James in the Colts offense look for the Colts to pass more often Pathon could be valuable down the stretch Bryant

<10165077.1075862000053.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-15 22:58:48,Footballguys Update Week Passing MatchupsHi Folks Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy Clayton Gray The Target and Redzone Data is from our Footballguy Andy Hicks Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs Detroit Defense If youre going to roll the dice on Jake Plummer this is the week against the Lions who rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks The Lions rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs WR David Boston is a bonafide All Pro and is worthy of starting in any league even with Plummer Denver Passing Game vs Washington Defense QB Brian Griese gets healthy and now finds himself with no WRs to throw to Eddie Kennison suffered a brain cramp last week and retired unretired was cut He didnt contribute much anyways but with Rod Smith hobbled with an ankle injury the Broncos are dangerously thin Smith says hell play though TE Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell could see more action The Redskin defense is awful ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so you have to like the matchup Indianapolis Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Peyton Manning looks like hell be ready to go broken jaw and all Theyll need him as Edgerrin James looks to be done for the year Id expect youll see Manning lean heavily on Marvin Harrison to carry the load Jerome Pathon reaggravated his foot and may not even play this week Reggie Wayne and Terrence Wilkins will be the other WRs New Orleans ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre very beatable For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense QB Aaron Brooks finally played like we all were expecting last week With yards and TDs plus another sure TD dropped by Ricky Williams lets hope this is what Brooks needed to get going WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson looked great and should continue to roll Indianapolis ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they shouldnt present too much of a problem New York Giants Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense QB Kerry Collins will likely be thinking of last years NFC Championship game where he toasted the Vikings It could happen again as the Giants are rolling while Minnesota is struggling WRs Amani Toomer Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius will see action The Giants are a run first team but that opens the pass as teams focus on stopping Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber The Vikings rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks San Francisco Passing Game vs Carolina Defense QB Jeff Garcia and WR Terrell Owens are no brainer starts against the AFC Pro Bowl Team so I think theyll probably warrant starts against the Panther defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks WR Tai Streets is worth a gamble as is our favorite Yale grad TE Eric Johnson Greg Clark hasnt been healthy in years it seems Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Elvis Grbac looks to be taking a step backwards as he looked uncomfortable in the pocket last week Look for the Ravens to run the ball to take pressure off the passing game This is a good matchup for Baltimore as the Browns rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Qadry Ismail was the big WR last week with yards and a TD Brandon Stokely is in the WR mix as well as the up and down Travis Taylor TE Shannon Sharpe is always a threat Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense The strength of this team is Corey Dillon and running the ball Kitna threw passes last week and that wont continue With TJ Houshmandzadeh becoming a factor the Bengals are getting back to the WR sets that were effective before Chad Johnson was injured Thats a big plus The Titans rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre definitely vulnerable For the year Tennessee ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Detroit Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Charlie Batch is throwing the ball a lot and thats just fine for his owners The problem is he doesnt have many guys who can catch it Lamont Warren and Corey Schlesinger caught more passes than WR Johnnie Morton last week That needs to change The Cardinals rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but theyre not that good For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Green Bay Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Favres playing as well as ever Start him Id start both Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder as well Having Schroeder back clearly is a big plus for Favre TE Bubba Franks is always worth a shot as well The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre no pushover Although thats an improvement from where the Falcons have been For the year they still rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Id feel good about all the Packers here Oakland Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Rich Gannon put together another solid game throwing for yards and TDs With guys like Tim Brown and Jerry Rice to throw to that doesnt hurt your chances Hell be facing a Charger Defense thats struggled a bit and now ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Safety Rodney Harrison will likely miss this week and that hurts Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense This team is about Jerome Bettis and running the football but part of Bettis success has to be attributed to the revival of the passing game Stewart offers enough of a threat that defenses must honor the pass Hines Ward is productive but hes about the only player from the passing game I can see starting in your league It is enticing this week though as the Jaguars rank just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks St Louis Passing Game vs New England Defense QB Kurt Warners thumb responded well to treatment this week and looks good to go Thats bad news for Patriot fans The New England Defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are must starts every week even against a giant killer team like New England Marshall Faulk is back in full swing and hell be a major part of the passing game again Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Chicago Defense QB Brad Johnson is starting to feel the comfort zone it seems although hes still dinking and dunking the ball yards per attempt last week Its basically Johnson Brad throwing to Johnson Keyshawn The Bears are not nearly as tough defending the pass as they are the run They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Could be a good matchup Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Buffalo Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Alex Van Pelt takes over and that could be a spark the Bills need WRs Peerless Price and Eric Moulds should be more involved Or on the other hand maybe well find Rob Johnson wasnt as bad as his OL made him look Well see Van Pelt probably isnt a starting QB anywhere his last start was in but he might be worth a shot if youre desperate Seattle is an average defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks But for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense QB Tim Couch spread the offense out to beat Baltimore earlier this year and Id look for them to employ a similar tactic this week Hes steady WR Kevin Johnson is clearly still his primary target The Ravens are tough on the run defense but rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tough matchup but dont count out Couch Dallas Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Leaf started his Dallas career with an unremarkable of for yard day TD and Int I guess it could have been worse Hell have another week of practice under the belt The Eagles are pretty average lately on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year theyre tough though ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs This doesnt look promising for Leaf or WRs Joey Galloway Raghib Ismail although both are big play guys and it only takes a few seconds for them to make your weekend They will have a speed advantage over the more physical Eagle Corners New York Jets Passing Game vs Miami Defense Vinnie Testeverde looks to have his exciting rookie WR Santana Moss available for his debut game this week Could be interesting as Dolphin Cornerback Sam Madison is injured and Moss could make things interesting if the Jets turn him loose Wayne Chrebet may be limited with a bad shoulder Laveranues Coles has been up and down The Dolphins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but clearly will miss Madison Philadelphia Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Donovan McNabb continues his outstanding play WR James Thrash has clearly identified himself as the prime WR over Todd Pinkston Young Freddie Mitchell is coming on strong too The Cowboys are pretty tough on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Although for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs This team may decide to keep it on the ground though given the huge success they had running the ball last week with Duce Staley and Correll Buckhalter Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Steve McNair sat out of Thursdays practice nursing his bad hand His status for Sunday isnt clear yet Although hes normally a question mark each week His target TE Frank Wycheck is hobbling too with an ankle but hopes to be ready by Sunday WRs Kevin Dyson and Derrick Mason are playing well lately The Bengals are average ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs K eep an eye on McNairs hand here Washington Passing Game vs Denver Defense Ill admit to being surprised at the success Tony Banks has had but you have to give the guy his due Hes stretching the defenses and making good reads And WRs Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner seem to play hard for him Theyll face a Denver Defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Denver held Doug Flutie in check last week so thats some worry TE Stephen is still looking very iffy for Sunday Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Atlanta Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense QB Chris Chandler was able to practice Thursday and thats great news The Falcons struggled without him WR Shawn Jefferson led all receivers last week with catches Ouch Hopefully with Chandler back Jefferson Terence Mathis and Tony Martin will do better On the flip side Chandler is his usual one shot away from the bench It wont be easy though against a tough Packer defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Carolina Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Ugliness all around here George Seifert has to look across at those er uniforms and wonder how it came to this QB Chris Weinke is reportedly looking pretty good in practice but coach Seifert was reluctant to name him the starter If he cant go Matt Lytle will start WR Muhsin Muhammad and TE Wesley Walls are maybe worth the gamble but their stock is certainly slipping with the QB play San Francisco is ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Chicago Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Look for QB Jim Miller to keep it pretty conservative in the passing scheme Tampa ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks The Bears want to run Anthony Thomas and throw enough to keep the Bucs off balance When they do throw look for multiple WR sets as they work rookie David Terrell into the mix with Marty Booker and Dez White Minnesota Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With the Vikings running game in disarray look for them to air it out against a tough New York Defense QB Daunte Culpepper will have his work cut out for him against the Giant defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Like Kerry Collins you can bet hell be thinking of the NFC Championship game from a year ago where his team fell apart Randy Moss and Cris Carter are starters in most leagues just on potential alone TE Byron Chamberlain could be a factor as well New England Passing Game vs St Louis Defense QB Drew Bledsoe proclaimed himself ready to start but Tom Brady gets the nod again this week No promises for next week but itll be hard to keep Bledsoes salary on the bench Well see Bradys been solid WRs Troy Brown and David Patten need to reengage and become a bigger part of the offense The Rams are tough ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks San Diego Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Is the Flutie Magic wearing off He certainly looked mortal last week This week hell be without TE Freddie Jones Even though Jones wasnt being utilized much he was still a nice outlet Tim Dwight is still out with a collapsed lung so that leaves WRs Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham to carry the load Both are capable Oaklands Charles Woodson may be limited with a bad foot and thatll help The Raiders rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Matt Hasselbeck offered a glimmer of hope last week and hopes to build on that success As long as Shaun Alexander is running wild Hasselbeck certainly has a chance with the play action pass Darrell Jackson in particular is looking better and Koren Robinson will work against a tough set of Cornerbacks The Bills rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and have sacks over the last games so this will be no cakewalk Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Jacksonville Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Mark Brunell and crew will have their work cut out for them as they face a much better Steeler team than they saw in week The Steelers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell both scored last week and continue to put up quality numbers The Steelers will throw Cornerbacks Dewayne Washington and Chad Scott who are very solid Plus the defense has recorded sacks over the last weeks Tough matchup Miami Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense QB Jay Fiedler quietly put a very nice game together last week with yards and TDs His WRs are solid and our guy Chris Chambers had a breakout game with TDs Oronde Gadsden is quietly putting together a nice season The Jets rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks though so itll likely be tough They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for the year and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Id look for the Dolphins to try and exploit their much softer run defense

NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Edgerrin James or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Red Zone and Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks Lets get to it Joe Rushing Game Matchups Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Baltimores Jason Brookins vs Cleveland Defense With Terry Allen out Jason Brookins gets the starting nod He fared pretty well against the Titans Monday with yards on carries ypc The Browns run defense is soft ranking just in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks With QB Elvis Grbac looking a little shaky in his return Id expect youll see Brookins pound the ball against a weak run defense Green Bays Ahman Green vs Atlanta Defense Green rolled for yards on carries ypc last week against a nasty Chicago run defense This week he faces a soft Falcon defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Start Green New York Giants Ron Dayne Tiki Barber vs Minnesota Defense With their outstanding running game last week look for the Giants to continue rolling on the ground Both Dayne and Barber had Red Zone touches last week Barber could be more effective in this game as he takes advantage of the fast track in the Metrodome Minnesota is awful defending the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id feel good starting either one of these guys San Franciscos Garrison Hearst Kevan Barlow vs Carolina Defense Hearst ran wild last week totaling yards on carries ypc Coupled with the Jeff Garcie Terrell Owens tandem thats a pretty tough offense Things look even better this week against an awful Carolina defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Kevan Barlow will stay as long as Hearst continues to put up numbers like this Plus Barlow is slowed with a quad injury Looks like a great matchup for Hearst St Louis Marshall Faulk vs New England Defense Im not going to insult your intelligence Start Marshall Faulk Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Detroit Defense Pittman started to get back on track a bit last week with yards on carries ypc Hell face a soft Lion defense this week that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Pittman should find room to run if QB Jake Plummer and WR David Boston can soften the defense just a little Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Tampa Bay Defense After a strong start last week against the tough Packer Defense Anthony Thomas was shut down Hell face a Tampa defense this week thats bark is worse than its bite They talk pretty big but only rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Well see what kind of resiliency Thomas has and if he can get back on track Lots will depend on the Bear passing attack and if Jim Miller can throw downfield enough to loosen the safeties Detroits Rueben Droughns Corey Schlesinger vs Arizona Defense Its an interesting matchup here James Stewart is out again and the combo of Droughns and Schlesinger will run the ball Droughns totaled just yard on carries last week ypc Even worse was Schlesinger who managed just yards on carries ypc On the upside both managed a TD and both were very active in the Red Zone This week theyll face a weak Arizona defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If youve been thinking about starting a Lion RB nows your chance Miamis Lamar Smith Travis Minor vs New York Jets Defense Lamar Smith has me worried a bit as he continues to look less than stellar while Travis Minor slashes up the defense Smith had yards on carries ypc Sunday while Minor ripped off yards on just carries ypc The good news is that the Jets run defense is still pretty bad Theyve improved recently but still rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If youve been starting Smith Id stick with him for at least this game He did have red zone rushes last week while Minor had none If youre in the gambling mood I might roll the dice with Minor New Orleans Ricky Williams vs Indianapolis Defense Williams rolled up a monster yardage day against the ers last week with yards on carries ypc and added yards receiving to it And it should have been better as he dropped a sure TD in the endzone that hit him right in the hands Needless to say hes rolling Hell be facing a very average Indy defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Although the Colts will be without their best defensive player OLB Mike Peterson The Saints also hope to have All Pro Offensive Lineman Willie Roaf back in action which will make the running game even more formidable Oaklands Charlie Garner Zack Crockett vs San Diego Defense Charlie Garner continues to run the ball between the s while Zack Crockett gets the scores Garner had yards on carries ypc last week but Crockett was the one with TDs I dont see that changing much Especially with Tyrone Wheatley due back any time The Charger defense is average ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Oakland Defense Look for Tomlinson to try and pull a Shaun Alexander who ran wild over the Oakland defense last week Im guessing youll see the Raiders stiffen a bit Tomlinson ran well last week but simply didnt get enough carries carries for yards ypc Doug Flutie is starting to look very vulnerable and the Chargers need to get back to Tomlinson and the ground game With the awful performance last week the Raider defense falls from to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Itll be interesting to see how they respond Seattles Shaun Alexander vs Buffalo Defense Alexander tallied rushing yards and TDs against a good Oakland defense last week You have to start Alexander against the Bills that rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Buffalos Travis Henry vs Seattle Defense Travis Henrys running hard he just isnt being given a lot of opportunities in this offense He totaled yards on carries ypc last week Im not sure any RB would do a lot behind that Offensive Line though He faces a Seattle defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so theyre pretty tough The Linebacking Corps with Levon Kirkland could cause some trouble Although new QB Alex Van Pelt could give the team a spark Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon should move back to the focus of this offense as the Bengals realize Jon Kitna isnt a guy that should try to carry this team The trouble will be that Tennessee defends the run very well ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyve come on lately as for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Like the Bengals Tennesses Defensive Ends are undersized and that could be trouble for a power running RB like Dillon Philadelphias Duce Staley Correll Buckhalter vs Dallas Defense Looks to me like Duce Staley is back after a great day totaling yards on carries ypc with a TD Correll Buckhalter was active too with yards on carries ypc and a TD Part of that was the Viking Defense but you have to give credit to the Eagles This week theyll face a Dallas team thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks I like their chances to keep it rolling I like Buckhalter but I think youll continue to see Staley garner more and more time Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Jacksonville Defense Jacksonville is decent against the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks but Jerome Bettis is pretty much a must start Hes rolling and this offense is heavily dependent on him to carry the load QB Kordell Stewart and WR Hines Ward have improved enough to keep the Defense at least somewhat honest and Bettis does the rest Tennessees Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense Even with Coach Jeff Fisher letting QB Steve McNair run the ball at the end of last weeks wild Monday Night game its clear that Eddie George is getting stronger Its also clear that Cincinnati is getting weaker on defense Last week they ranked this week theyre down to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks The Bengals are undersized on the Defensive Line especially at Defensive End and this could be a nice matchup for the powerful George Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Denver Defense Davis is finally starting to pay some dividends for his patient owners rushing for yards on carries ypc in his last game Hes rested after a bye and should be able to keep the roll going against a Denver Defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Last week the Broncos yielded yards to LaDainian Tomlinson on just carries ypc The improvement of Stephen Davis can be tied directly to the better play of QB Tony Banks and his WRs Teams cant stack the line now as they have to respect the deep ball Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Atlantas Maurice Smith vs Green Bay Defense Maurice Smith rolled for yards on carries last week against a Cowboy defense that doesnt allow much on the ground Hell face a tougher defense in Green Bay this week thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Although if you watched the Chicago Green Bay game last week you saw Anthony Thomas have great success early in the game running right at the Packer defense The Falcons are feeling more comfortable with Smith and Id look for them to do the same thing Not a great matchup here but one Id not be particularly afraid of if Im a Smith owner Dallas Troy Hambrick Emmitt Smith vs Philadelphia Defense Hambricks coming off a great week where he rushed for yards on carries ypc against a suspect Falcon Defense Hell face a pretty good Eagle team ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Emmitt Smith practiced late this week and could play but with Hambrick playing well I doubt youll see him rushed back Keep an eye on Hambrick although hes expected to play hes nursing a pretty serious shoulder injury himself Denvers Mike Anderson Olandis Gary vs Washington Defense As the Terrell Davis Saga takes another turn downward the Broncos turn once again to Mike Anderson and Olandis Gary Theyll be ready The trouble I think is that the WR corps are limping Rod Smith and goofy Eddie Kennison Kennison is gone and Smiths ankle looks like something thatll hopefully allow him to play but you dont know how much hell be limited Smith has been their offensive focus and if he cant go the running game will be affected To make it worse Washington has been surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Primarily because they rank in Passing Yards Allowed over that same span but that doesnt really matter Teams clearly feel they can throw against Washington Although with Smith less than this might not be the case for Denver All in all not a great matchup ESPNews was reporting Thursday night that Olandis Gary could possibly get the start Welcome to Shannyland See how this shakes out as right now its looking very murky Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs New Orleans Defense Dominic Rhodes had a nice game in week where he rushed for yards on carries ypc He found the going tougher last week with just yards on carries ypc Plus he injured his shoulder The yards per carry numbers are disturbing On the plus side Edgerrin James is out for at least a while and maybe the season so Rhodes is the man New Orleans plays a decent run defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs QB Peyton Manning has a broken jaw but says hell play NOTE ESPN is reporting now that the nd opinion on Edgerrin James knee was no better than the first and that he looks to definitely be done for the year New Englands Antowain Smith vs St Louis Defense Antowain Smith had to enjoy his game last week against his old team where he rushed for yards on carries ypc and TDs I doubt hell have the same success against the Rams who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks New York Jets Curtis Martin vs Miami Defense Its still all about Curtis Martin in this new West Coast offense which looks a lot like the old Curtis Martin Offense Martins coming off a monster day where he rushed for yards on carries ypc and TDs Hell face a solid Defense this week in Miami They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Martin is one of the few RBs to have a lot of success against Miami Look for the Jets to ask him to do it again this week Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Carolinas Richard Huntley Nick Goings vs San Francisco Defense This is UGLY Goings was the leading rusher last week with yards on carries ypc Huntleys done very little with his golden opportunity to start yards on carries last week Id avoid all Panthers here Clevelands James Jackson vs Baltimore Defense James Jackson played a gutsy game last week against a tough Pittsburgh defense gaining yards on carries ypc It wont get any easier this week against the Ravens who rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs MLB Ray Lewis continues to be a terrific run stopper along with the DTs Tony Siragusa and Sam Adams Back in week Jackson did run for yards and a TD so its no sure thing hell not produce its just a tough matchup Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack Fred Taylor vs Pittsburgh Defense The question of the week is whether Taylor can play or not Hes set to practice this week but its still not clear how much if any hell be able to go Watch this one closely Obviously his chances are much better than Macks although Mack has shown a nose for the endzone and finally seems to be earning some points with Coach Coughlin Whoever runs the ball will have a tough day as Pittsburgh ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year Unless Taylor looks great late this week and youre out of other options Id look elsewhere Minnesotas Doug Chapman Michael Bennett vs New York Giants Defense Michael Bennett will likely play although were hearing Chapman will start Im not excited about either against a tough New York Defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Im guessing both will play and neither will do a lot Tampa Bays Mike Alstott Warrick Dunn vs Chicago Defense Good luck figuring this running game out In week it was Alstott with all the Red Zone touches rushes pass target TD Last week it was Dunn in the Red Zone rushes pass target TD Go figure This week theyll face a tough Chicago defense still smarting from Ahman Green The Bears rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and I dont think Id want to be catching this week Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing

Bennett or those who feel like taunting the Moss Bennett owners in your league heres the latest from the Star Tribune in Minnesota and yes when I say guys I mean you girls too so please spare me the avalanche of email I always get whenever I say guys Laughing Joe Vikings Bennett Will Miss Game Moss Play Will Be Limited Entire Story storieshtml Clipped from the Kevin Seifert article published online An offense based on speed might have to get by on guile this week The Vikings two fastest players are questionable for Sundays game against the Green Bay Packers and one of them almost certainly will not play Receiver Randy Moss and tailback Michael Bennett are both suffering from sprained right ankles and while Moss likely will play at limited capacity Bennett is expected sit out Sunday The revelation of Moss injury coincided with his least productive start in four NFL seasons while Bennetts ailment will allow him to quietly step back from his own disappointing start and give way to Doug Chapman I think Randy will be able to play Vikings coach Dennis Green said Monday I dont think there is any doubt about that Michael will probably not be able to play Moss seemed less confident of that certainty however The ankle which he originally sprained playing basketball prior to minicamp in began throbbing during Sundays victory over the Detroit Lions Green and members of the Vikings medical staff characterized the pain as residual affects from the injury a condition he will continue to have the rest of his career But Moss woke up Monday morning with more stiffness and soreness than ever according to trainer Chuck Barta As he departed Winter Park Moss said the ankle is fine man Its fine But asked if there was no doubt he would play Sunday Moss only shrugged his shoulders It would behoove him to try Moss has caught passes for at least yards in five of his six games against the Packers and has more receiving yards against them than any other team Bennett who cut off interviews with local media last week declined to comment Monday The No draft choice has struggled to replace Robert Smith as the Vikings featured running back rushing for yards and a yardspercarry average while failing to score a touchdown in five games The Vikings also have been disappointed in his ability to pick up blitzes in pass protection While Chapman does not represent a clear improvement in that area some in the organization believe Bennett might benefit from a week or two on the sideline He was limping noticeably Monday at Winter Park while wearing an immobilizing boot Assuming the Vikings rule Bennett out for Sunday Green said Chapman would start and Travis Prentice would begin assuming more of a shortyardage role Harold Morrow would serve as a third tailback Chapman who has rushed times for yards in limited playing time this season said he would be ready Its not music to my ears when somebody gets injured but this is the NFL Chapman said Im more than capable Im just going to go out and do what I have to do Of greater concern is Moss condition He has caught passes for yards and one touchdown in five games this season his secondlowest output for the first five games of a season came in when he caught passes for yards and three touchdowns Moss had an uncharacteristically sloppy game Sunday against the Lions dropping two passes and allowing a third to go through his arms and into the hands of Lions cornerback Todd Lyght for an interception He mistimed his jump on several other occasions a mistake Green attributed to the injury and Moss removed himself from the game liberally to catch his breath Randy Moss doesnt normally drop passes Green said One thing you can always tell if a guy is hurt his concentration level is not there Its very difficult to play at your best if you are not percent healthwise I think that was clearly the case yesterday with Randy so were going to do everything we can to get him as close to possible to percent Moss has never missed a game since joining the Vikings playing in all regular season and six postseason games He declined an invitation to the Pro Bowl after bruising several ribs during the NFC Championship Game but Green lauded Moss tolerance for pain Moss will undergo roundtheclock rehabilitation this week and Green said he should know by Thursday how much Moss will be able to play Without Moss at his best and without Bennett at all the Vikings will be missing two of their top speedsters against the Packers Their injuries will place an even greater emphasis on the performance of quarterback Daunte Culpepper who rushed for a careerhigh yards Sunday while also playing a near errorfree game We prefer to have our total speed out there but were a fast team overall Green said Were quick and explosive Its not just because we have Randy because we have some other guys with some speed So we will be able to operate I think the best thing is that Daunte will get better every game He loves big games I think hell be ready to play a tremendous game and well depend on him to a certain extent to help operate our offense this week OUR VIEW Clearly bad news here You know we never got on the Bennett bandwagon but hes been even worse than we expected Chapman could make some noise but the Travis Prentice issue is ugly Plus you have the best goalline back in the game with QB Daunte Culpepper For Moss my guess based on what we know now is that you have to start him and cross your fingers Hes too good to sit unless you have excellent options at WR He can turn a game and your weekend around in a couple of plays Id have to be blind to say I wasnt seriously worried about him but I dont think I could sit him unless youre really deep there More as we hear it Thanks to our

for it sooner Hope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy Clayton Gray Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Arizona Passing Game vs San Diego Defense We rated Plummer as a Lock matchup and he delivered with yards and TDs If only they could play Detroit each week This week theyll face a San Diego team that ranks just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs WR David Boston is unstoppable and a must start Frank Sanders played well too last week but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TD reception Check Plummers status as he has a bruised tailbone but Id feel good about him again this week Atlanta Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last week leading the Falcons to a huge upset over the Packers He threw for yards and TDs Terance Mathis led the way with receptions Mathis suffered a concussion but the early reports are that hell be able to go This week the Falcons face a soft Carolina defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing Chicago Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Jim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like Montana to Rice Sunday I dont recall the last time I saw two consecutive bomb TDs to the same player like that Sunday Millers been up and down but clearly Booker is a guy to watch Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix but this seems to be Bookers show The Viking defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may be able to continue to roll Green Bay Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Favre isnt as red hot as he was but hes still a premier QB He threw for yards and TDs last week He spread the ball pretty well between Billy Schroeder Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford Bradford had the big yardage while Schroeder and Freeman scored All are solid plays TE Bubba Franks continues to be a non factor The Pack draw a great matchup this week in Detroit that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so you have to like that Minnesota Passing Game vs Chicago Defense If youd been thinking about benching Daunte Culpepper Randy Moss or Cris Carter you got your answer Monday night These guys should always be in your lineup as theyre too explosive to sit against any matchup The Bears rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so clearly this is a must start for these guys The only downside to the Moss Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of the party San Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense You dont need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia Hes clearly one of the premier QBs in the game Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviously a must start JJ Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves a look Tai Streets is not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting more involved in the offense each week Its sort of like St Louis where any of these guys are worth a gamble Indy ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so the ers are looking good here Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Does anyone else find the Baltimores self destruction amusing The Grbac tear thing on the sidelines which looked like sweat to me and then Shannon Sharpes posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting about interceptions was pretty funny Can Brian Billick hold it all together Wheres Trent Dilfer when you need him Grbac will be fine I think Sharpe is always a good play if you can stand having him on your team Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options as theyre seeing plenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score Lots of weapons in this passing game Theyll be facing a Jaguar defense thats reeling and beat up They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Jacksonville ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for the year All in all a good matchup here Detroit Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense A perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror Fantasy Charlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is so bad and hes forced to throw on every down Regardless of the reason you have to give this guy some credit as hes clearly becoming more comfortable in the system He threw an amazing attempts last week for yards and TDs Ill take that WR Johnnie Morton led the way with yards RB Lamont Warren had catches but his status is up in the air with the return of James Stewart Green Bay is nothing special against the pass lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they are pretty tough on QBs though ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Trent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have to wonder how much can be done in a week Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready to play this week but you know how that goes Id be leery until I see him play some Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy As always TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat Seattle has been below average lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New England Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Coach Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady would be the starter until further notice Great news for Brady fans whod been sweating a Bledsoe comeback Bradys come back down to earth lately with a mediocre yard day last week but hes still showing promise WR Troy Brown is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of a start in most leagues New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs New Orleans Passing Game vs New England Defense Aaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those including us whod been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype passing TDs plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy Id go with the hot hand and keep him in your lineup Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choice as Willie Jackson is up and down TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach if you need a guy there He caught TDs and looked good doing it New England ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but be careful as Bill Belichick seems to sometimes pull out something special to confuse young QBs Oakland Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense You have to like Rich Gannon here against the Giant defense that was torched by Minnesota last week Gannon threw for yards and TDs Sunday and looks as in control of this offense as ever Jerry Rice looked half his age running all over the field and played outstanding Tim Brown is as good as ever This team has serious weapons and should go deep in the playoffs if not all the way The Giants rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Kordell Stewart once again looked like a real NFL QB He threw for yards and a TD Most importantly he didnt fold up when Jerome Bettis was held down Hines Ward caught passes for yards and a TD and looks to be a good play most every week as hes clearly the go to guy Tennessee ranks just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so these Steelers could have a chance to do something through the air here San Diego Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Doug Fluties magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately Losing TE Freddie Jones last week surely didnt help even though Jones wasnt being thrown to as much as wed like to see Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham struggled with Flutie This Arizona defense could be the ticket though as Charlie Batch discovered last week They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than that They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Kurt Warners a must start obviously As are Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt Both are outstanding Bruce had the big yards Sunday while Holt got the TD RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs just another reason why hes the best Tampa is limping but they rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They do have sacks over the last games so theyre obviously putting pressure on the QB Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Carolina Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Are you really down to starting Chris Weinke I didnt think so Muhsin Muhammad could miss this weeks game with a shoulder injury That means Donald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to go TE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the focus lately Maybe he needs to have another Keyshawn Fit and yell about not getting the ball enough That worked pretty well for him last time The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyre definitely toastable Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense It doesnt appear to be the best thing for the Bengals but Jon Kitna continues to air it out He threw passes Sunday for yards and TD Interceptions The Bengals have about WRs it seems and all are pretty good Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday Darnay Scott is the but its a crowded group there making it tough to pick out any one player The Brown defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so youd think Cincinnati would be able to throw the ball For the year Cleveland ranks in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs though so its not like its a cakewalk Cleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Tim Couch is winning the real NFL games even though hes not doing much for your FF team lately His yard TD Int game Sunday is an example of that Hell get back on track though Kevin Johnson and Dennis Northcutt seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too Honestly I wouldnt count on too much from anyone but Johnson The Bengal defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyve been tough lately For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Indianapolis Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Peyton Manning looked solid even with the broken jaw Jerome Pathon is gone for the year and Reggie Waynes knee is an issue It looks like itll be his old reliable target Marvin Harrison Keep an eye on TE Marcus Pollard as he could easily be the best receiver after Harrison San Francisco ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs You never know when Manning will throw that monster game though so its tough not to play him if hes on your roster Philadelphia Passing Game vs Washington Defense Donovan McNabb didnt wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didnt need to in order to win the game He threw for yards with TD James Thrash is still the go to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice in larger leagues TE Chad Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so you like to see that The Redskins are starting to believe in themselves and now rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks A dangerous game against the Redskins who have nothing to lose and can play with abandon Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense As a consistent Rob Johnson basher Alex Van Pelt kept me from looking bad by playing extremely well Sunday with TDs and yards And he actually finished a game Clearly he gives the Bills a boost Eric Moulds is still the WR but Peerless Price had a huge game with yards and a TD Larry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay Riemersma caught a TD Miami is hurting without CB Sam Madison They rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so theyre still tough Denver Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Brian Griese just keeps losing weapons From Ed McCaffrey to Terrell Davis now Rod Smith is limited with a bad ankle Theres only so much a QB can do without his weapons Smith is saying hell try to tough it out and play Thursday but its very questionable how effective hell be if he plays My friend and Denver local BJ Miller says his guess is that Smith will dress but likely not finish the game after reaggravating the ankle Id agree with that prediction TE Desmond Clark needs to become a bigger part of the passing game here The Cowboys are solid on defense ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so its a tough matchup here for the Broncos New York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Kerry Collins threw for yards but couldnt find the endzone Monday night Ike Hilliard continues to improve and actually was more effective than Amani Toomer Tiki Barber remains a strong force in the passing game and that should continue All of these guys are solid starters Oakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Matt Hasselbeck posted yards and TD Sunday With the way Shaun Alexander is running thats probably enough Koren Robinson and Darrel Jackson are the primary targets but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ball around Kansas City ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks although for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Brad Johnson rolled up yards Sunday without throwing a TD Thats hard to do Keyshawn Johnson remains TDless which I admit is cruelly amusing Thatll have to break soon though as hes just catching too many passes not to score I wouldnt be surprised to see him explode with a couple of multiple TD games as the odds even out Johnson to Johnson is really all there is to talk about with this passing game The Rams are solid ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Washington Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Tony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham did a fine job filling in WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this season hanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has always expected him to be He had receptions for yards and a TD last week The Eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so itll be a challenge Philadelphia ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and for the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Should be a tough game Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Dallas Passing Game vs Denver Defense Ryan Leaf did little to impress anyone Sunday with a yard TD Interception game I cant get excited about anyone on this offense Joey Galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but its pretty bleak overall Denver ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and that doesnt help any Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Mark Brunell is looking very iffy again and itll likely be Jonathon Quinn again Has there ever been a good QB named Jonathon Thats bad news for the Jaguar WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell although both played decent last week With Fred Taylor out again Baltimore should have a field day The Ravens rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Id shy away from these guys unless I had few options Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jay Fiedler looked lost last week throwing for yards TDs and Interceptions Hell have his up and down games but he seems to be settling back more toward the downside His WR corps is solid with James McKnight Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers but its hard to put a lot of faith in Fiedler I do like Chambers and his big play ability Buffalo has been tough lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Its actually not so much an issue of them being tough as it is teams just dont need to throw to beat them Regardless offenses havent been putting up a lot of yards on them For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense A typical Steve McNair week Major questions all week as to whether hell be healthy enough to play Guts it out through the game rushing for more yards than George throwing for yards and TD It might win NFL games but that probably wont carry your FF team Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are both decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his best receiver The Steelers bring a great defense though ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs not to mention the fact theyve logged sacks over the last games Tough matchup here Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to infoterms

<26283446.1075863019788.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-20 15:47:20,Footballguys Update Week Rushing Matchups Hi Folks I know many of you have early deadlines this week so I juggled my schedule to get these early Heres how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheet online wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Atlantas Maurice Smith vs Carolina Defense Smith was upstaged last week by big Bob Christian who looked great on the TD pass reception and run Smith had yards on carries ypc Keep an eye on his health as he was nicked in Sundays game Smith has been up and down but facing this Carolina defense may be what he needs The Panthers are ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If youve been thinking about starting Smith this could be the week Green Bays Ahman Green vs Detroit Defense Ahman Green was semi quiet running the ball against Atlanta last week carring times for yards ypc Hell face a soft defense this week against the Lions Detroit ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Greens a sure starter here San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Arizona Defense Everyone keeps talking about the rookie wall and Tomlinson just keeps plugging Sunday he posted yards on carries ypc plus a TD Not bad This week he faces the soft Cardinal defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs If Tomlinsons been your guy Id certainly start him again here Seattles Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense Alexander continues to have a bulldog like hold on the starting RB job Coach Mike Holmgren is now softening his stance on Ricky Watters return saying Watters might be the rd down back when he returns But even that seems to be a couple of weeks away Alexander is the man Hell face a Chief defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Alexander has to be licking his chops though at their ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Baltimores Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense Brookins did a nice job last week against Cleveland carrying the ball times for yards ypc Id expect him to improve each week as he gets more comfortable in the role of RB He didnt catch any passes so thats a little bit of a worry This week he faces a Jacksonville Defense that did a pretty good against Jerome Bettis last week They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Watch very closely how the team and self appointed spokesman Shannon Sharpe handle the Elvis Grbac interceptions thing Could lead to a more conservative gameplan with a focus on running the ball more Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Cleveland Defense Corey Dillon showed last week why he gets saddled with the inconsistency rep carries for yards ypc wont carry your team The sad thing is hes so hard to predict when hell break out This week he faces a Cleveland Defense thats ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so youd have to think he has a chance The Browns rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs as well Chicagos Anthony Thomas vs Minnesota Defense Thomas didnt make much noise last week with just yards on carries ypc Fantasy owners are trying to decide who the real Thomas is This week hell face a soft Viking defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs I think well see him get back on track The Bear passing game will definitely open up some lanes for him Miamis Lamar Smith vs Buffalo Defense The Lamar Smith woes continue He showed glimpses of breaking out but wound up with yards on carries ypc Im not as worried about Travis Minor stealing too much from him as he only managed yards on carries ypc This Miami running game has faded quickly Theyll face a soft Buffalo defense this week that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Yorks Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Oakland Defense Barber looked very good Monday while Dayne was awful Barber rushed times for yards plus he caught passes for yards Dayne on the other hand rushed times for a whopping minus ypc NEGATIVE ypc The Raider defense isnt much ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this is probably a good matchup At least for Barber Id start Dayne at your own risk until he shows me something New Orleans Ricky Williams vs New England Defense Start Ricky Williams Hes rolling yards on carries ypc plus another receiving The reemergence of QB Aaron Brooks is a huge factor and Ricky should keep it up New England ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but I wouldnt let that deter me at all San Franciscos Garrison Hearst Kevan Barlow vs Indianapolis Defense Hearst continued the miracle story with another fine outing last week He had yards on carries plus he caught passes for yards He looks to be too much for Kevan Barlow to overtake at this point Barlow did have carries but it looks pretty clear that Hearst is the guy The Colt defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Tampa Bay Defense You dont need me to tell you to start Faulk Just do it and count your blessings that you own one of the best players in the universe Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman vs San Diego Defense Pittman ran pretty hard last week gaining yards on carries ypc but yielded a TD to Thomas Jones last week Thats not good This Charger defense is definitely one that can be run on as they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They dont give up many points though as evidenced by their ranking for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Arizona offense was clicking last week albeit against Detroit but its a little unclear as to exactly how Pittman fits in Carolinas Richard Huntley vs Atlanta Defense Huntley was much more involved this past week and showed his owners some signs of life He rushed times for yards ypc and also caught passes Encouraging signs This week he faces a Falcon defense that could be primed for a letdown after the big Green Bay win They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Dallas Emmitt Smith vs Denver Defense Emmitt actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to post yards on carries ypc He was nicked late in the game so check his status this week but he looks like hell be ok for Thursdays game The Broncos rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but are still pretty strong for the year ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Denvers Mike Anderson vs Dallas Defense Anderson posted a whopping yards on carries ypc against the Redskins last week Olandis Gary didnt do any better with yards on carries ypc At this point youd have to say the entire Bronco offense is in disarray WR Rod Smiths injury is a huge factor as theyre simply not the same with him less than This week they face a pretty good defense in Dallas that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Being a short week will not help matters Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs San Francisco Defense Dominic Rhodes didnt make anyone forget about Edgerrin James but he did prove what we all were thinking Being the RB for Indy is not a bad thing He got the score and also rolled up yards on carries And hell likely improve Not bad for a guy who probably wasnt drafted in your league The er defense is average ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Kansas Citys Priest Holmes Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense After a bye week of rest Holmes will see how he fares against the Seahawk defense Seattle ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Theyre nothing special but they do a nice job of shutting down Travis Henry and Buffalo last week Oaklands Charlie Garner Tyrone Wheatley vs New York Giants Defense Everyone including me hoped that Charlie Garner would take advantage of the opportunity with Wheatley out to show he could be a full time RB Just didnt happen Now Wheatley is reportedly back and ready to go and Garner looks to keep running it between the s while Wheatley or Zack Crockett punch it in at the goalline Garner still puts the yards up though Sunday he rushed for yards and caught another The Giants defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and showed last night they can be vulnerable Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Philadelphia Defense Stephen Davis continues to roll up the yards Last week he totaled yards on carries ypc This week he faces a decent Eagle defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Tony Banks will likely be back at QB although Kent Graham did fine Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Buffalos Travis Henry Larry Centers vs Miami Defense Travis Henry looked pretty bad last week carries for yards ypc just isnt going to cut it for you Throwing fumbles on top of that could put his playing time in jeopardy Sammy Morris and Shawn Bryson are champing at the bit Dont forget about Larry Centers He had yards receiving on passes Sunday and those are likely valuable stats in your league The Dolphin Defense ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so itll be no cakewalk Clevelands James Jackson Ben Gay vs Cincinnati Defense Jackson was a late scratch from Sundays game and Ben Gay made the most of his opportunity You gotta love this guy Hes a very hard runner and while raw displayed some nice talent Im guessing Gays play will be the best rehab Jackson could ever receive Jackson is reportedly ready to go against Cincinnati this week The Bengals are pretty tough against the run ranking For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New Englands Antowain Smith vs New Orleans Defense Smith struggled against the Rams Sunday night with yards on carries ypc Id expect tough going again this week against the Saints that rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs New England seems to be coming back to earth a bit and you know the Tom Brady Drew Bledsoe thing has to be a distraction for the team Philadelphias Duce Staley vs Washington Defense Any worries Duce Staley owners had about Correll Buckhalter stealing time went up in smoke last week sorry Staley looked like the Duce of old rolling up yards on carries He threw in receptions for yards to boot Washington is surprisingly tough against the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks It wont be a cakewalk but still you have to like Staley with the way theyre playing now Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense Bettis was held very much in check last week with the exception of one yard run Even with the big run his totals of yards on carries ypc werent much Wont be much easier this week against a good Tennesee defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks The Titans shut down Corey Dillon last week who has a similar power style Id have a hard time not starting Bettis though as hes definitely the focus of this offense and getting better as QB Kordell Stewart continues to improve Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Detroits James Stewart Lamont Warren Corey Schlesinger vs Green Bay Defense Talk about a muddy situation Last week Lamont Warren Corey Schlesinger and Rueben Droughns each had at least carries And just for good measure James Stewart is reportedly ready to play this week Throw in the added bonus that Green Bay is very tough and ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Thats enough to make me shy away from all these guys That and the fact Charlie Batch may throw it times Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense As we told our readers today the news isnt good for Fred Taylor His doc is telling him to stay out of the lineup for this week and theyre sounding way too vague for my liking as to when hell be back That probably means Mack gets the call by default He posted a stellar yard on rushes ypc day Yes ZERO point Elvis Joseph can run back kicks but he only managed yards on his carries And QB Mark Brunell could miss the game with his leg injury All in all pretty ugly going against the Ravens Defense whos fallen down to in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks but is still nasty Minnesotas Michael Bennett vs Chicago Defense Bennett got the carries Monday night while Doug Chapman saw no action Bennett had yards on carries ypc so youd have to think hes on the right track back When Culpepper Moss and Carter play like they did Monday its pretty clear the Vikings wont need a lot from their RB This week hell face a much tougher opponent in Chicago The Bears rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and are playing very well For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so itll be a tough matchup coming off a short week Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs St Louis Defense Dunn and Alstott put up pitiful numbers Sunday Dunn had yards on carries ypc Alstott had yards on carries ypc although he did get a score Granted it was against a tough Chicago team but thats awful This week theyll face an injury riddled St Louis team that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks Even with the injuries I dont like either of these RBs here Tennessees Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense Its bad when the QB out rushes the RB but thats what happened last week George put up yards on carries ypc and seemed to take a step back The trouble with him is that his game is so power oriented that when the holes arent there he simply cant do much This week itll be much tougher against the swarming Steeler defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Im not one for benching your best players but this is one matchup youll want to look at very closely Thatll do it

<18603941.1075863019839.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-19 18:51:20,Footballguys Update Week Upgrade DowngradeHi Folks Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this weeks Updgrades and Downgrades Enjoy Joe Upgrades QB Aaron Brooks Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and Brooks fantasy owners must be ecstatic Brooks has scored multiple touchdowns in of the last weeks and I expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the season With an easier schedule and better decision making Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks Willie Jackson and breakout tight end Boo Williams QB Jeff Garcia Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers He has thrown for or more touchdowns in of the last games I wouldnt bench Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now He is a stud QB Charlie Batch Batchs yard touchdown performance deserves recognition However I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for the winless Lions A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as Green Bay Chicago Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule QB Rich Gannon A strong performance on Sunday with yards and touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the AFC With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic Gannon will continue to post good numbers for the remainder of the season QB Kurt Warner Warner looked good on Sunday night with yards and touchdowns More importantly he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb injury that has been nagging him throughout the season As always keep Warner in your starting lineup QB Jake Plummer Plummer looked good on Sunday with passing yards and touchdowns Keep in mind this performance was against the hapless Lions Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks against San Diego and Oakland Plummer might be a good option for playoff weeks as he faces Dallas in week and Carolina in week RB Shaun Alexander Plain and simple Alexander produces when he is in the lineup He scored his th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly cleared yards once again Look for Alexander to remain the starter once Watters returns from injury RB Duce Staley Staley continues to look better and better The total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the second half of the season Philadelphias offense and a rock solid defense will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games With Correll Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana Staley will not lose many carries to Buckhalter RB Warrick Dunn Dunn managed just yards rushing against a solid Bears defense but a catch yard receiving performance helps vault him into the upgrades section More importantly it appears that Dunn has returned to after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries RB Garrison Hearst Hearst nearly reached the yard plateau once again He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend for the remainder of the season The ers offense continues to look good and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of starting running backs in the league RB Ricky Williams The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient With Brooks making wise decisions the offense will continue to get better and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams Williams has topped the yard mark in consecutive weeks Look for this trend to continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the season WR Marty Booker The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield and Bookers statistics were directly affected He burned the Buccaneers for long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy Look for more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season With teams starting to sell out to the run Booker and Miller should connect on some play action pass touchdowns WR Joe Horn Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with catches for yards on Sunday With Aaron Brooks making wiser decisions the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the board Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners it is good news for Horn Ricky Williams and Willie Jackson WR Jerry Rice With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from defenses Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field The career touchdown leader added more to his total on Sunday and made it look rather easy With the Oakland offense looking good Rice should continue to see scoring chances A good option for a rd wide receiver in your lineup WR Peerless Price With catches and yards receiving on Sunday Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo With Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams Price has quietly scored touchdowns on the season Price is a talented receiver and should continue to score a touchdown every other week WR Hines Ward Ward has amassed catches in his last games He has only scored two touchdowns on the season but his reception and yardage numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis Ive never been a big fan of the Steelers passing game but Ward deserves consideration for active duty on a weekly basis WR David Boston Bostons yard game streak ended this week Fantasy owners had to settle for yards receiving and touchdowns Look for Boston to continue to put up quality numbers Downgrades QB Brian Griese The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little bit heading into Sundays game so I was not surprised by Grieses poor performance on Sunday With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for the year Grieses receiving options were limited and his production was directly affected You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is healthy However the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving QB Tim Couch Couch threw interceptions and was held to passing yards against a stingy Ravens defense Couch should be considered a quality keeper quarterback but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent quarterback for the remainder of this season Couch should do well against Cincinnati and Jacksonville but struggle against New England Green Bay and Pittsburgh QB Mark Brunell An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup this week With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week it may be best to start someone else this week QB Elvis Grbac Grbac looked horrible with interceptions on Sunday The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw touchdown passes The schedule looks favorable for Grbac but he is struggling which concerns me QB Tony Banks Banks suffered a concussion in Sundays game against Denver The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and then taken off the field on a stretcher QB Jay Fiedler Fiedler threw interceptions and touchdowns on Sunday Unfortunately Fiedlers two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense The up and down season for Fiedler continues With games against Buffalo Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule Fiedler should still be considered a quality spot starter RB Eddie George George was held to yards on carries Sunday He has yet to break the yard barrier in a game this season I guess the toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most anticipated Although we can blame the toe injury two other factors have meant the demise of George this season First the loss of lead back Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes Finally the Titans offensive line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons RB Anthony Thomas Thomas was held under yards for the second consecutive game With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout the remainder of the season Keep in mind the Bears last two opponents Green Bay and Tampa Bay are two of the better defenses against the run in the league With Tampa Bay Green Bay Minnesota and Detroit on the schedule for the remainder of the season expect Thomas stats to be up and down RB Lamar Smith With rushing yards on carries Smith continues to struggle This marks the th consecutive game that Smith has been held yardscarry Dont be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger role in the running game RB Travis Henry Henry continues to struggle He managed just yards on carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble A running back can not be productive with just carries Keep him on your bench WR Rod Smith Suffering from an ankle injury Smith was limited to yards on three catches He did manage to score a touchdown Smiths ankle injury deserved your attention The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines late in the th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the field and tie the ball game The short week will not help Smiths status on Thanksgiving Day WR Eric Moulds The disappointing season for Moulds continues He was held to yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained on the other side of the field Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills at this point WR Wayne Chrebet A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on Sunday Testaverde and the passing game isnt looking very good at this point You may want to bench Chrebet until he is healthy WR Todd Pinkston Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list Heck I like the guy and think he could become special However he remains to do what is neededproduce on a consistent basis WR Muhsin Muhammad Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable to play in the second half against San Francisco Heck his production was not missed Its pretty difficult to miss little to no production if you know what I mean If youre a Muhammad owner you know what I mean WR Reggie Wayne Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status is not yet known He has yet to do anything special this season but his expectations were fairly high so Ill downgrade him Waiver Wire Keep in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and team leagues QB Alex Van Pelt Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on Sunday with passing yards and two touchdowns He has a talented receiving crew with Moulds Price and Riemersma As long as he can get pass protection his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in need of a quarterback RB Ben Gay Gay was the feature back on Sunday with carries for yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense No other running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense Gay may just be that guy RB Amos Zeroue Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the Browns Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against Jacksonville If you have Jerome Bettis on your team Zeroue deserves a roster spot If not you may want to take a flyer on this guy The Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers RB Lamont Jordan Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue If Curtis Martin gets injured Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality numbers Not a bad option if you can spare a roster spot If you have Curtis Martin get Lamont Jordan WR JJ Stokes Stokes looked good on Sunday with yards and a touchdown This marks the second consecutive game with yards With the ers looking good in the passing game a healthy Stokes could be a decent spot starter WR Keith Poole Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the Redskins However he continues to learn the offense and should start producing very shortly Pooles effectiveness will most likely occur with a healthy Rod Smith garnering doubletriple teams on the opposite side of the field TE Boo Williams Boo has me excited about his potential Hes a big fast tight end with good hands Plain and simple he has big play potential and should produce in the Saints offense Bryant

<29943025.1075853086376.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-10-18 03:05:19,Footballguys Update Week Passing MatchupsHi Folks Heres how I see the matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper Mannings your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense New Orleans Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense A good dose of the Atlanta Defense may be just what New Orleans and QB Aaron Brooks needed The Falcons are awful ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Brooks will be throwing to WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson Albert Connell is there but not a big factor Of course the biggest news from last week was the awakening of TE Cam Cleeland He could play a big role if he gets fired up Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense You have little choice but to start Brett Favre Last week he hung TDs on the Ravens so I think he can handle the Vikings WR Antonio Freeman awoke from a slumber and did it in a big way The question of the week is can he continue Part of his success can be attributed to his public demand for more passes which Favre said he approved of and made good on his promises to target Freeman more Although an ankle injury to WR Bill Schroeder was no doubt a factor as well It looks like Schroeder will play but the ankle is still sore If Schroeder can go both look to be a good start against the Vikings defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre also in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs TE Bubba Franks is a must start as it seems every pass he catches is for a TD Jacksonville Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense After a hot start it seems like its been forever since the Jaguars have scored a passing TD That should change this week as they face a soft Buffalo Defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre even worse when it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs ranking Pretty much all the Jaguar skill positions look good here WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are must starts Theyll be too much for Cornerbacks Ken Irvin and Antoine Winfield TE Kyle Brady is a nice play here too He was the target of passes in week Kansas City Passing Game vs Arizona Defense A game against Arizona may be just what the disappointing Chiefs need Trent Greens been nowhere near as good as everyone including us hoped but Im not sure its all his fault Hes had trouble keeping a WR Corps healthy and teams are doubling and tripling TE Tony Gonzalez their best player Priest Holmes has put a spark in the running game and thatll help WR Derrick Alexander only caught one pass last week but he had thrown his way so hes getting the opportunities Hell likely make much better use of his chances this week against a Cardinal team that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so Green could break out as well Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Tennessee Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Steve McNair awoke last week and played a very solid game against Tampa Bay throwing for yards and TD Hell have a much easier time this week against a Lion team thats hurting in the secondary Detroit ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but theyre vulnerable They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs WR Kevin Dyson is probably the best bet for WRs Derrick Mason is still nursing a bad ankle and his status isnt clear yet Chris Sanders could see time too and hes been targeted some lately Of course the favorite receiver is still TE Frank Wycheck St Louis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Just start your Rams Warner Holt Bruce and probably Hakim and TE Conwell all deserve starting status Until I see it again Im calling the Giants game of last week an aberration The Jets defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but Id start these guys against the AFC Pro Bowl Team Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense This could be an ugly game for the Steeler passing game Tampa plays primarily zone defense which means Stewart will be forced to pick his spots from the pocket And we all know the pocket is no friend to Stewart who is best when he can run a little Man coverage allows a QB more freedom to tuck and run with defenders in coverage He will face a tough Defense with the talent to hold down WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress On the plus side Tampas given up a lot of yards to the passing game though ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so the potential is there for Stewart to do something Im just not sure what itll be Carolina Passing Game vs Washington Defense QB Chris Weinke gets better each week Is he playing well enough to carry your team right now Probably not But he might start getting there The Redskins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Weinkes primary targets will be WR Muhsin Muhammad and TE Wesley Walls Both should have decent opportunities this week On the upside Washington Cornerback Fred Smoot will likely be limited if he even plays with a bad knee Denver Passing Game vs San Diego Defense QB Brian Griese has complained of shoulder pain all week and missed early practices but says hell play Sunday Gus Frerotte will go if Griese cant Good luck getting a straight answer out of Skeletor Shanahan love that guy but if I had to guess Id play him Weigh it out though if you have another solid option of course The Chargers are looking suddenly very beatable after New Englands Tom Brady hung yards and TDs on them The key will be Eddie Kennison staying on a roll He takes the incredible pressure off Rod Smith and can stretch the defense keeping Safety Rodney Harrison back where he belongs and off the line San Diego ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but can definitely be thrown on Detroit Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense What got into Charlie Batch Whatever it is lets hope he can keep it up He posted some great numbers last week with yards TDs and most importantly interceptions Hell try to keep it rolling against a suspect Titan defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre ranked in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Cornerback Samari Rolle is out again and that hurts Germane Crowell may not know when to run out of bounds but he can rack up the yards Look for him to do it again Johnnie Morton will man the other spot and do well In minor news it looks like Herman Moore is done for the year with a torn muscle in his hip Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Washington Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Are you really down to this If so Tony Banks may be ok this week Carolina ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks And theyre the worst team in the league in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Still though I hate to think Im putting too much faith in these guys WR Rod Gardner is getting more looks than anyone at this point Michael Westbrook scored last week and maybe he can build on that TE Stephen Alexander is out with a bad ankle San Diego Passing Game vs Denver Defense Fluties fun to watch but make sure to understand this team is about RB LaDainian Tomlinson I hear some comparisons to Denvers John Elway finding a young Terrell Davis but this isnt the same Flutie just wont put up the stats consistently Curtis Conway Tim Dwight and Jeff Graham are all seeing about the same amount of work and that makes it tough to pick one Unfortunately TE Freddie Jones has been very inconsistent and frustrating for his owners Im not sure that will change The Broncos are pretty solid against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With a week off to prepare look for the Eagles to come out firing Somewhat like Green Bay did last week against Baltimore look for them to focus on the pass against a defense that is extremely good against the run Theyll have their work cut out for them though The Giants pass defense has been up and down Of course lately theyve been very up holding the high flying Rams to a mere mortal points and no passing TDs Thats strong But they rank just in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre a little tougher on QBs ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Donovan McNabb has two solid under rated WRs in Todd Pinkston and James Thrash that can stretch the field TE Chad Lewis has been seeing a lot of balls thrown his way and could do damage here New England Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Tom Brady continues to impress as he gains confidence in the system Hell go against the Colts this week who have to be wondering where their Super Bowl aspirations have gone The key in my opinion is WR Terry Glenn who brings an entirely new dimension to this team Brady threw the ball his way times last week Troy Brown is a quiet option but he gets a ton of targets last week The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Chicago Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Im looking for Jim Miller to bounce back from an awful game last week against Arizona The Bengal defense is pretty solid ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyll be without Cornerback Rodney Heath Corner Robert Bean is probable with a leg injury so hes likely less than The Bengals rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so thats some encouragement WR Marcus Robinson will have a size advantage on the Bengal Corners and watch for Marty Booker who was the target of more passes last week than was Robinson Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense New York Jets Passing Game vs St Louis Defense With every passing week it becomes more and more clear that this new offense is really just a slightly different way to get Curtis Martin the ball And thats the smart move for Jets fans Vinny Testeverde draws a pretty tough matchup this week in the Rams who rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Laveranues Coles has been getting plenty of looks and is a good play Wayne Chrebet will handle the intermediate stuff as he always does Atlanta Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Chris Chandler still has plenty left in the tank as long as he can protect his head The Saints could cause trouble with an aggressive blitzing defense thats recorded sacks already That Super Dome floor isnt much softer than the carpet covered concrete of the Georgia Dome so injury is always a worry New Orleans is tough ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Look for Chandler to focus on Terance Mathis and Shawn Jefferson as he did last week although Jefferson is risky listed as questionable with ankle toe problems Buffalo Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Will the week off benefit Rob Johnson I really dont know You know by now that Im down on Johnson He does have two potentially very good WRs though in Eric Moulds and Peerless Price Both have underachieved this season and its hard to know whether to blame them or Johnson Jacksonville is average defending the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre much tougher in shutting down QBs though as they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Cornerback Fernando Bryant is Questionable with a bad foot and thatll be a big plus for the Bills if he cant go Cincinnati Passing Game vs Chicago Defense It may not seem like a big deal but the Bengals will miss WR Chad Johnson whos out with a broken collarbone He was a true deep threat that took heat off of Darnay Scott and freed up Peter Warrick underneath Well see how they work without him Jon Kitna continues to play a Trent Dilfer like good enough to win game and I dont see that changing a lot The Bengals would love to get games like last weeks yard TD and interception the biggie out of Kitna This offense is all about RB Corey Dillon The Bears are tougher against the run than they are the pass Chicago ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They bring a tough pass rush with sacks in their last games All in all a pretty tough matchup Cleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Green Bay showed last week one way to beat Baltimore was to concede the running game and focus on throwing the ball Thats fine as long as you have Brett Favre under center Tim Couch may one day be very good but hes a long ways from Favre today The Ravens rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they can be thrown on Kevin Johnson has been hot for the Browns and Quincy Morgan is getting almost as many balls thrown his way as Johnson The Ravens bring two very good Cornerbacks in Duane Starks and Chris McAlister thatll make it a tough game for the Browns Indianapolis Passing Game vs New England Defense If you can afford to bench Peyton Manning youre deep enough at QB that you dont need our help The Patriots are pretty tough ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They also rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Id still start Manning unless I had a great option though Hes just too liable to have a great game against anyone Same for Marvin Harrison Jerome Pathon is still very iffy for this week and Id avoid Rookie Reggie Wayne is still learning the ropes and had passes thrown his way last week Im not counting on a whole lot yet from him Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Must be something in the Nashville water that awoke both Steve McNair and Brad Johnson last week Johnson finally listened to Keyshawn and threw him the ball times Sunday Both Johnsons had strong games and hopefully the light flicked on for Brad Johnson Jacquez Green had several looks but clearly this is a Johnson and Johnson team now The Steelers are very tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs as well so its pretty clear that its a tough matchup for the Bucs New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense After a heartbreaking loss to the Rams the Giants face a very tough Eagle pass defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so itll be tough going for the Giants here QB Kerry Collins hasnt been anything special lately and look for the Eagles to continue their huge array of blitzes that they love Hell be throwing to Amani Toomer who needs to pick up the pace he started with early Ike Hilliard is back but still not seeing as many passes thrown his way as Joe Jurevicius Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense For all the anti Viking talk Culpepper continues to post some excellent Fantasy Stats His rushing TDs are huge in many scoring systems Of course the big question this week is the health of Randy Moss ankle Coach Denny Green came out this week and said Moss has been limited by the effects of his ankle sprain suffered before his rookie season I personally would come up with something better than that Denny Green is a players coach and it wouldnt surprise me at all if this were primarily a protection move for his star WR Id fully expect Moss to play but certainly hes a risk The Packers are very tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks Theyre also in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs With RB Michael Bennett out this week the Vikings will likely be throwing all day so you know theyll be getting the opportunities Its a very tough matchup though Arizona Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Plummers always a roll of the dice and this week isnt any different Hell face a KC defense thats very tough statistically against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks When it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs they rank David Boston is clearly Plummers best option and hell match up pretty well with the Chiefs MarTay Jenkins and Frank Sanders will see some action but youll be hard pressed to start them Id think Probably a risky matchup this week for a Cardinal team thats suspect in talent to begin with Baltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Elvis Grbac returned back to reality last week with a disappointing game against the Packers He was held to yards TD and Interceptions also suffering a neck injury concussion Hes listed as probable and should improve upon those numbers this week but not by a lot The Browns are tough against the pass ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks More impressively they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs Cornerbacks Daylon McCutcheon and Corey Fuller should do a pretty nice job of matching up with WRs Travis Taylor and Qadry Ismail Of course Shannon Sharpe is always a threat Bottom line this is a tough matchup for Baltimore Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an

than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Edgerrin James or Marshall Faulk Greens your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Locks These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense Kansas Citys Priest Holmes vs Arizona Defense The bright spot for the Chiefs offense was Holmes last week as he rolled up yards on carries for a ypc average plus TDs Not a bad day against a very good Pittsburgh defense This week itll be considerably easier against the Cardinals Arizona ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs They make everyone look good and that likely wont change this week Theres also a chance Tony Richardson could play this week St Louis Trung Canidate Marshall Faulk vs New York Jets Defense Faulk owners had quite a scare this week Over a hour period his injury status went from weeks to weeks to possibly playing in this weeks game To make matters more frustrating the Jets are weak defending the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs They did look better last week though but I still think theyre very vulnerable Trung Canidate will likely get the start and he could shine if given the opportunity That system and surrounding cast is so good Im not sure I couldnt put decent numbers there If I had another option outside of Faulk Id probably go there as its very risky to look for anything from him If I had Canidate this could be the game to start him Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack Frank Moreau Elvis Joseph vs Buffalo Defense Tough call of the week here With Fred Taylor still out my guess is itll be Mack getting the start Until he fumbles or fails to produce Both of which have a pretty good chance of happening Then youll see Frank Moreau and our guy Elvis Joseph You may see a good bit of Moreau anyway The frustrating thing is that the Bills matchup is so attractive They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id go with Mack if youre in the gambling mood as he just might pay off against that defense Arizonas Michael Pittman vs Kansas City Defense Check Pittmans status this week as hes dealing with a concussion that he played through during the game Early this week he was still having headaches but Id be surprised if doesnt get the bulk of the carries Thomas Jones had only carries for yards last week and I dont see that changing a lot Pittman ran for yards on carries ypc but the Chicago defense is very tough This week hell face a much softer KC unit that ranks just in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks When it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs they rank for the year Im not too discouraged with last weeks poor showing since the Chicago D is very tough on the run and I think you may see Pittman perform better this week Carolinas Tshimanga Biakabutuka Richard Huntley vs Washington Defense If youve been wondering if you should ever start Biakabutuka heres your chance The Redskins rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They also are worst in the league in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs On the flip side Biakabutuka struggled against a tough New Orleans defense last week gaining just yards on carries ypc The biggest stat though was that he did have another fumble Weve seen already that Coach Seifert wont put up with much of that Bottom line is that its a great matchup but I seriously wonder about Biakabutukas ability to capitalize on it Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense Tennessees Eddie George vs Detroit Defense Look for Eddie George to build on his positive performance from last week where her rushed for yards on carries ypc against the Bucs Hell find the going easier against a Lion defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Theyre improving but clearly they havent been able to stop many people George isnt his old self but he may be getting there The improved play of QB Steve McNair was the big news from last week and he needs to keep it rolling to take heat off the running game Baltimores Terry Allen Jason Brookins vs Cleveland Defense Jason Brookins is breathing down his neck but Allens hanging pretty tough The veteran shows little signs of wearing down Against a very good Green Bay defense last week he ran for yards on carries ypc Brookins totaled yards on carries for ypc but heres a very disturbing stat for Allen owners As you can see from our Red Zone data redzonehtm Brookins has gradually been seeing more and more Red Zone touches In week he had rushes in the redzone compared to for Allen Last week he had red zone rushes while Terry Allen had zero Allen did have a pass thrown to him in the Red Zone The Cleveland Defense is below average ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Clearly Brian Billick has confidence in Brookins with the Red Zone touches and thats a trend thats likely to continue Washingtons Stephen Davis vs Carolina Defense If youve been hanging with Stephen Davis all season you might as well give him another shot here The Panthers are weak against the rush ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Panthers will be forced to start a banged up Linebacking corps that could be vulnerable Davis ran well against the Cowboys totally yards on carries ypc but he needs to get in the endzone He might get that chance against Carolina New Yorks Tiki Barber Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense This one is tough to call right now Barber did some running this week and is Probable to play The game is Monday night though so hes got an extra hours or so to get ready Dayne looks to be ready to roll here and he could do some damage against an overrated Eagle rush defense They have the good reputation but in reality they rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so its no fluke My best guess on Barber is that hell play a good bit I wouldnt be surprised to see the Giants look almost back to normal with Dayne and Barber New Englands Antowain Smith vs Indianapolis Defense QB Tom Brady is improving every week and thats helping the running game This week theyll face one of the softer defenses in the league in Indy The Colts rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Even worse when it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs they rank Smith will need all the help he can get Last week he ran for yards on carries ypc against San Diego Although the Chargers are tough and he did get a TD Remember that Indy is the team that got Smith rolling back in week three where he broke out with yards on carries ypc and TDs Hes inconsistent but this is a good matchup for Smith Green Bays Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense The fast track of the Metrodome paired with the Viking defense should make for a nice game from Green Last week Green was held to just yards on carries ypc But that was against Baltimore Against a Viking team that yielded yards to James Stewart last week I think Green will fare even better Statistically the Vikings have been ok ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs But this team is struggling Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way San Diegos LaDainian Tomlinson vs Denver Defense LaDainian Tomlinson enters this week as the RB over the last weeks Hell be facing a pretty tough Bronco defense ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Denver is tough between the tackles but Tomlinson has shown he has the speed and skill to break outside when he needs to San Diego knows Tomlinson is the key to their success and I expect them to lean heavily upon him New Orleans Ricky Williams vs Atlanta Defense Williams is playing as well as any RB in the game right now Hes running hard and more importantly he looks like hes having fun Dont underestimate that angle for a guy like Ricky Williams The Falcon defense is decent ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre a little tougher in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank I cant see benching him unless youre just totally loaded at RB Indianapolis Edgerrin James vs New England Defense Play Edgerrin James You dont need me for that He rolled up yards on carries ypc against Oakland Sunday night New England ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Start James Detroits James Stewart vs Tennessee Defense James Stewart rolled last week against a weak Viking defense posting yards on just carries ypc This week hell face a definitely beatable Tennessee defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre even more vulnerable if you look at Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank QB Charlie Batch played a great game last week and hell go a long ways toward helping Stewarts numbers although this team does seem more interested in throwing the ball than they do in letting Stewart control the ground game Buffalos Travis Henry vs Jacksonville Defense Travis Henrys had a week to rest and gets the national stage to prove himself on Thursday night Jacksonvilles defense has been up and down this year They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks LB Hardy Nickerson is still Questionable with his neck injury If he cant go thatll surely be a plus for Henry Even without Nickerson theyve been pretty tough only allowing TDs in the last games I think everyone pretty much agrees Rob Johnson isnt going to carry this team now so look for Coach Gregg Williams to see if Henry can shoulder the load Keep an eye on his knee situation as hes had a nagging soreness that the docs are diagnosing as tendonitis The word now though is that hell be able to play through it Chicagos James Allen Anthony Thomas vs Cincinnati Defense Another week where itll be tough to tell who gets the carries We keep expecting Thomas to grab more and more time but Allen is hanging on Last week Allen rushed times for yards ypc plus a TD Thomas had carries for yards ypc Obviously both were effective Allen is still getting the Red Zone Touches though so it seems pretty clear that coach Dick Jauron has faith in him The Bengals rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id look for a similar distribution of carries between Allen and Thomas this week although I think youll see more and more of Thomas Its murky enough right now that I dont honestly feel real good about either guy Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense Tampa Bays Warrick Dunn Mike Alstott vs Pittsburgh Defense Warrick Dunn made it back onto the field last week when he wasnt expected to He did score a TD but overall he was totally ineffective rushing for yards on carries ypc Mike Alstott was even worse running for yards on carries ypc Its pretty bad when Brad Johnson has the best ypc average on the teamat ypc This week they face a tougher defense in Pittsburgh The Steelers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Pittsburghs Jerome Bettis vs Tampa Bay Defense Heres a troubling thought about Jerome Bettis for this week that was brought up on our message boards wwwfootballguystalkcom this week Remember in week when all the talk was about Bettis being limited in Jacksonville because of his asthma and the Florida heat and humidity Bettis went on to total yards on carries ypc against Jacksonville Guess what the weather is predicted to be in Tampa weatherweekahtm degrees and humid It wont help that Tampa has a solid rush defense ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks Theyre stingier with points ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs On the upside Linebackers Derrick Brooks and Jeff Gooch are probably not I like Bettis and hes on a roll but this is a tough matchup here New York Jets Curtis Martin vs St Louis Defense Curtis Martin ran exceptionally well against a tough Miami Defense last week posting yards on carries ypc Hes by far the focus of that offense Look for more of the same this week against the Rams St Louis is solid against the run ranking in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They seem to give up a lot of points though as they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Look for more Martin to again carry the load Atlantas Maurice Smith vs New Orleans Defense Smith struggled last week against a good San Francisco rush defense He only gained yards on carries ypc Even worse of those yards came on one carry That means he had just yards on carries for ypc Joes Note Im not a fan of taking one big play away and looking at the numbers as I think you can really skew the data that way But its also something worth keeping in the back of your mind On the plus side he garnered of the Falcons rushing attempts so he looks to be the man For an even bigger plus he scored a rushing TD This week he faces a very tough New Orleans defense that ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the season This may not be the best week to start Smith if youve got other options I want to see how he does against this tough defense and to see if Coach Dan Reeves starts using Bob Christian a little more Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Chicago Defense Power vs Power The Bears have been playing excellent run defense behind Brian Urlacher Keith Traylor and Ted Washington They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks More impressively they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year Dillon will be a great test though as theyve not faced a RB of his caliber yet Last week he rolled for yards on carries ypc and a TD But the Browns dont bring the same defense that Chicago will The key will be Jon Kitna and his passing game keeping the defense honest If the safeties are able to walk towards the line it might be a long day for Dillon Hes been handled by tough defenses once this year with Baltimore holding him to yards on carries ypc It should be noted though that the Bears are not yet the Ravens on defense and that Dillon did find the endzone in the Baltimore game with a TD reception Not the best matchup for Dillon but one that will be fun to watch Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense Philadelphias Correll Buckhalter Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense Duce Staley will likely make his return back from a shoulder injury this week but its unclear how much hell play Rookie Correll Buckhalters done a very good job in his absence But I think its pretty clear that its Duces job when hes healthy Im not too excited about either player this week against a Giant defense that is shutting down the running game They rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Id avoid both of these guys this week unless youre really short on options Minnesotas Doug Chapman Travis Prentice vs Green Bay Defense Frustrated Michael Bennett owners can at least know for sure how hell do this week He wont play Bennetts nursing a bad ankle and Coach Denny Greens named Doug Chapman the starter But also look for Travis Prentice to see time as the short yardage goal line guy Considering the Vikings already have one of the best goal line backs in the league with QB Daunte Culpepper the situation is even murkier Throw in the fact that Green Bay plays very solid rush defense and Im not real excited about any of the Viking RBs The Packers rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks And they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Denvers Mike Anderson vs San Diego Defense Anderson will have his work cut out for him against a tough Charger defense that held New Englands Antowain Smith to yards on carries ypc last week Anderson and the Broncos are a lot better than Smith and the Patriots but still it wont be easy San Diego ranks in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Anderson was held in check last week against a good Seattle defense rushing for only yards on carries ypc QB Brian Grieses shoulder is still sore and Anderson will need a healthy Griese to loosen Safety Rodney Harrison whos a run stopper supreme Terrell Davis has been making a little noise about possibly playing this week but I dont see it Its about to get murky again though If you dont feel like dealing with the Shanahan guessing games here soon you should move Anderson now Clevelands James Jackson Jamel White vs Baltimore Defense Dont go here Lets say it this way Last week James Jackson totaled yards on carries for a whopping ypc number Against Cincinnati I like the Bengals but theyre not Baltimore Look elsewhere Baltimores streak of not allowing a yard rusher will end sometime It wont be this week though Thatll do it for the Rushing Matchups Passing Matchups to follow Joe Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights

<28290872.1075853086490.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-10-16 05:42:30,Footballguys Update Week Upgrade DowngradesHi Folks Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this weeks players who are moving up and down in value IMPORTANT NOTE Remember that Dallas and Oakland are on byes this week in addition to Miami Seattle and San Francisco Dallas and Oakland were originally scheduled to play but moved their game up This could affect your team if you had planned on any Cowboys or Raiders filling in for your Miami Seattle and San Francisco players Dont get caught shorthanded and make a pickup if you need to Also remember the Thursday game this week if your league has special rules for turning in rosters Have a great week Joe Upgrades QBs Moving Up QB Jeff Garcia Garcia looked great on Sunday against the Falcons with passing yards rushing yards and total touchdowns He continues to prove that the season is no aberration As long as Terrell Owens remains healthy Garcia will continue to produce Very impressive on Sunday QB Steve McNair After appearing invisible for the season heading into Sunday McNair shocked and impressed fantasy owners with yards passing yards rushing and total touchdowns against a solid Tampa Bay defense Although he was impressive on Sunday dont rely on McNair as your fantasy team starter on a weekly basis If McNair could get some big play weapons on offense he could become a top flight fantasy quarterback For now be happy with Sundays performance QB Vinny Testaverde Testaverde impressed with an efficient performance once again on Sunday Testaverde has yet to throw an interception this season With touchdowns in the last games Vinny is looking good Keep in mind Testaverde has yet to surpass the yard barrier so his value is much higher in basic scoring leagues RBs Moving Up RB Ricky Williams After a slow start to the season Williams has gained total yards and touchdowns in his last games Keep in mind Williams has already had his bye so he should be a fixture in your lineup for the remainder of the season as long as he stays healthy RB Eddie George George finally delighted fantasy owners with total yards and a touchdown on Sunday The patient owner will start to see the rewards of having George on the roster for the remainder of the season With George having Miami Jacksonville Baltimore Tampa Bay and a bye week in the first weeks of the season his schedule was difficult The schedule only gets easier for George during the remainder of the season Look for a strong finish to the season out of George RB Priest Holmes With Tony Richardson out of the lineup Holmes was given the chance to produce and he has not disappointed During his last games Holmes has averaged total yards and scored touchdowns More importantly Holmes has apparently claimed the feature back role in the Kansas City offense Look for Holmes to ride the production train for the next few weeks with matchups against Arizona and Indianapolis RB Warrick Dunn Expected to be out weeks Dunn returned to the lineup after a week absence and delighted fantasy owners Despite having just yards rushing Dunn added yards receiving and touchdowns The early return gives Dunn a tremendous upgrade RB Shaun Alexander Will Ricky Watters have the starting job when he returns from injury Probably not Alexander finished with rushing yards and touchdowns against Denver With Watters in the last year of his contract look for the Seahawks to keep Alexander in the starting lineup for the remainder of the season A great keeperdynasty running back RB Ron Dayne After being limited in practice by a neck injury suffered in the Washington game Dayne hit the field and a delighted fantasy owners With rushing yards and a touchdown on Sunday Dayne continues to gain momentum into being named the teams feature back With Tiki Barber hampered by a hamstring injury Dayne will be able to post quality numbers against some poor defenses WRs Moving Up WR Keyshawn Johnson Johnson took over the game with catches for yards against Tennessee However he has yet to connect with Brad Johnson for a receiving touchdown this season WR Kevin Johnson Johnson was able to beat a bad Cincinnati secondary for a career high yards receiving on Sunday With the continued development of Tim Couch Johnson could be a quality fantasy option for the remainder of the season Keep in mind Cleveland plays in a tough division where low scoring games will be the norm WR Terry Glenn Once thought to be written off for the entire season Glenn returned in a big way on Sunday with yards and a touchdown If the Patriots offensive line can protect the quarterback Glenn could have a decent remainder of the season Dont expect these type of numbers every week Look for Glenn to put up inconsistent numbers the rest of the way WR Terrell Owens receiving yards and touchdowns deserves an upgrade in my book Basically keep him in your lineup every week WR Germane Crowell Crowell finished with yards and a touchdown on Sunday Everything looked good with Charlie Batch at the helm for the passing game Reality checkthis game was against the hapless Vikings secondary Regardless yards and a touchdown deserves the upgrade TEs Moving Up TE Cam Cleeland Despite having just catches for yards on Sunday Cleeland was able to get into the scoring column with the all important touchdowns With opponents fearful of the Saints wide receiving corps of Horn Jackson and Crowell Cleeland is seeing plenty of one on one coverage Cleeland is most likely on a fantasy roster If not go get him TE Bubba Franks reception for yards Not that impressive unless you realize that both catches were touchdowns Franks has scored touchdowns in the first games this season Look for continued success as Franks is a key to success for the Packers in the red zone TE Marcus Pollard The Colts continue to get Pollard involved in the offense He has averaged receiving yards in the last games while scoring a touchdown However Pollard ran a couple poor routes that led to two interceptions for Manning Downgrades QBs Moving Down QB Rob The Running Joke Johnson Yep thats right With the help of all the sharks out there we were able to once again downgrade Rob Johnson even with him being on a bye week After spending a few hours laughing through numerous Rob Johnson takes I was unable to come to a decision on the best take With that said I will let you the sharks decide the best Rob Johnson downgrade take Cast your vote on the footballguystalkcom message board Buffalo Fans we feel your pain out there I know you guys are some of the best fans in the league were just trying to lighten things up Here are a few takes from some of our readers Take I just took the SAT and actually had this question I think it sums it up best Samuel L Jackson is to Mr Glass as Rob Johnson is to A Mr Styrofoam B Mr Balsa Wood C Mr Tin Foil D Mrs Glass I said D What do you think did I get it right Thanks Jonathon Hoff Take Rob Johnson took his heaviest blow this past week injuring not only his neck pinched nerve but also his best side Johnson was quoted as saying Sure the neck hurts but this bruise on my cheek is really going to affect my promo photos Hows a guy supposed to make a living While Johnson is daytoday because of the neck it appears his profile injury will keep him out of the pretty business for weeks Adding insult to injury his agent apparently will have Flutie sub for Johnson during this hiatus The agent responded Hey when Johnson couldnt cut it on the football field last year Flutie kicked ass so I suspect he can replace Rob here too Were downgrading the Buffalo QB and wed keep Johnson on the bench in fantasy football and in fantasy modeling Guy Whitehead Take Top Reasons to downgrade Rob Johnson Silly headband brings back painful s memories Deceased blues legend Robert Johnson is a more viable fantasy option Janet Reno considers ordering agents to take Doug Flutie by force and return him to his rightful home in Buffalo Johnson might be sent to Cuba to live with Elian Gonzalez Castro to protest before United Nations and demand Alex Van Pelt instead Sneaky agent includes bonus clause for appearing on injury report Jerry Jones praises Johnson as his next big find Regards MKF Seriously Now Another QB Moving Down QB Trent Green Green continues to disappoint fantasy owners With the nagging injuries to Derrick Alexander and Marvin Minnis being inexperienced Green continues to have problems finding his wide receivers Prior to the season there was speculation that the loss of Sylvester Morris would hurt Greens production The speculation was correct RBs Moving Down RB Ricky Watters The emergence of Shaun Alexander downgrades the injured Watters value further RB Marshall Faulk Faulk suffered a sprained MCL on Sunday Initial indications speculated that Faulk would miss weeks of action The next reports had Faulk missing games Now theyre saying he could play this week Regardless make sure you grab Trung Canidate if you are a Faulk owner Itll help you sleep better RB Tyrone Wheatley Despite getting the carry at the goal line and a short score Wheatley gets the downgrade this week With just carries for yards and a fumble it appears the Raiders are leaning towards making Charlie Garner the feature back More importantly Wheatley missed a key pass block that led to a hard hit on Rich Gannon Basically it appeared that Wheatley shied away from contact on the play and did his best bullfighter imitation Jon Gruden did not appear very happy RB Mike Alstott carries for yardsOUCH RB Michael Bennett Bennett was able to manage carries on Sunday However he finished with just rushing yards and no touchdowns Plus Bennett suffered a sprained right ankle that forced him out of the game Keep him on your bench for the time being WRs Moving Down WR Bill Schroeder Schroeder suffered a sprained ankle in Sundays game versus Baltimore The injury does not appear to be serious but something worth watching Because of the injury Schroeder is downgraded this week WR Derrick Alexander Plain and simple Alexander has done nothing this season and is among the biggest disappointments of the fantasy season Alexander earns a spot on the Biggest Disappointment Team WR Willie Jackson Although I am still high on Willie Jackson he was held to just yards on catches this weekend Every receiver will have bad outings throughout the course of the year so this might be a little harsh placing him here But its a murky situation how the distribution will play out in New Orleans QB Aaron Brooks needs to get it going WR Wayne Chrebet Chrebet has failed to score on the year and seems to have taken a back seat to Laveranues Coles in the Jets wide receiving crew Theres a chance Chrebets numbers could increase as teams start focusing their attention on the speedy Coles but for now were a little worried about Chrebet Waiver Wire QB Charlie Batch During comeback mode against the Vikings Batch managed to gain yards and pass for touchdowns Dont get too high on Batch yet Remember this performance came against a mediocre Vikings secondary However Johnnie Morton and Germane Crowell provide Batch with two quality receivers Look for more good games out of Batchagainst weaker defenses QB Tom Brady With the addition of Terry Glenn in the lineup Brady torched the San Diego defense throughout the game Dont expect these kind of numbers on a weekly basis but there are signs that Brady has the potential to become a good fantasy quarterback although you have to consider Bledsoe and what happens when hes ready to go Regardless Brady is a decent option for fantasy owners in need of a quarterback right now RB Trung Canidate Canidate will probably get at least start as the running back for the powerful Rams offense Marshall Faulk was expected to miss at least weeks during initial reports The the next reports have Faulk missing weeks of action Now theyre saying he could play this week Hes still not a bad guy to have for insurance RB Anthony Thomas Thomas continues to get a good number of carries It is becoming more apparent that the Bears are slowly giving the feature back role to Thomas Look for Thomas role to become larger and larger as the season progresses WR Terry Glenn Once thought to be written off for the entire season Glenn returned in a big way on Sunday with yards and a touchdown If the Patriots offensive line can protect the quarterback Glenn could have a decent remainder of the season Dont expect these type of numbers every week but Glenn could be a welcome addition to a fantasy team in need of a receiver WR Donald Hayes With defenses rolling coverage in the direction of the talented Muhsin Muhammad Donald Hayes is seeing a lot of oneonone coverage With catches and a touchdown on Sunday it appears that Chris Weinke and Hayes are starting to build a quality QB to WR relationship WR Eddie Kennison Kennison showed signs of quality production this week With Rod Smith seeing doubletriple coverage on the other side of the field Kennison will be given a great chance to post excellent fantasy numbers Kennison is an extremely talented receiver and maybe this weeks performance was needed to get him over the hump Check back next week for The Generals AllDisappointment Team Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To

wallcfm You can add your team here addwallcfm Theres not much better than flaunting your success in front of your league members Enjoy Hi Folks Heres how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week PLEASE NOTE See the cheatsheets online at wwwfootballguyscom for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean Id start the player with the best matchup Jeff Garcia may have a horrible matchup one week but unless youre sitting on Kurt Warner or Brett Favre Garcias your guy no matter who hes lining up against The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players Note Ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these writeups Stats are provided by Mike Halls excellent FLM League Management Software for more info The points scored by position data is from ESPNcom Lets get to it Joe Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell Stewart combined for passing yards and TDsKitna had of those yards Wow When you throw it times most every receiver will be involved and thats what happened Sunday Peter Warrick was very active maybe the benching helped in week The Titans rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks so this is enticing although you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again For the year Tennessee ranks Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly its a good matchup Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Griese only put up yards passing Sunday but it was enough Expect him to do better this week Rod Smith is of course the man here and hell do well too The Colts rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense Manning came up small in the yardage department with under yards Sunday but he did run in one score Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go to guy Mannings a competitor and youd have to think hell give a great effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for The Broncos rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs St Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Mike Martz showed last week hell let his guys play Regardless of the playoff situation I think youll see Warner in for at least a half and maybe much more And like Marshall Faulk a half of Warner is better than a full game from most other players Picking the WR is a lottery shot as Holt Bruce Proehl or Hakim are all liable to go off The Falcons rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense Cant imagine youre in week with many Carolina guys on the roster Weinke did ok last week Its tough when youre upset about Isaac Byrd possibly missing time but thats where they are Both he and Muhsin Muhammad could miss the last game The Patriots rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks so theyre definitely vulnerable For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Its a good matchup simply because New England hasn t been much on defense I have little faith in the Carolina players to take advantage of the matchup though Chicagos Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense When you think its going to be all Anthony Thomas Jim Miller and the passing game decided to show off Miller put up yards and TDs as the Bears continued to roll Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he s thrown The Jaguars rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway deep Galloway seems to be the WR of choice Hes worth a gamble for sure The Lions rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so its a nice matchup It all depends on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it One more thing the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his yard season so that may be a factor Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with TDs and yards Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like weve been expecting He saw times as many passes as the WRs Maybe thatll continue this week The Seahawks rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his yards which isnt bad Chris Chambers Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with catches Look for him to be used more as Lamar Smith struggles The Bills rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Tom Bradys had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense Two teams going drastically different directions here Terry Glenn could continue to make an impact and you know Troy Browns ready The Panthers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Hindsight is but if Trent Dilfer isnt the most under appreciated player in the NFL I dunno who is Hes won a jillion games including a Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw TDs and save the Seahawks season at least for another week The big question is will he get another shot Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play Stay tuned Darrell Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod you have to look hard at him The Chiefs rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Jeff Garcia threw for and TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last week Plus he rushed for another TD Terrell Owens is a must start JJ Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved The Saints defense ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with yards and Interceptions to go with his TD The usual suspects of Qadry Ismail Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active The Vikings rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense Favre came up small last week with just yards and TDs Granted it was really cold but that hasnt seemed to bother him much in the past Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual TE Bubba Franks saw a handful thrown his way Theyll face the banged Giant secondary this week ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with Interceptions vs TD and just yards Its not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading receiver but thats what happened Sunday Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came up small This week theyll face a er defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Stewart threw for yards and TDs Sunday although he did have Interceptions Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is showing shades of becoming a dominant WR Hines Ward is solid as well The Browns rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Steve McNair continues to play well with yards and TDs Hes a totally different QB when he throws the deep ball Although Eddie Georges reemergence may quiet that a bit Dyson and Mason both saw an equal number of passes and both scored This week theyll face a Bengal defense ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Tony Banks put up a whopping yards passing last week But part of it was the big lead Washington was able to post Westbrook left with an ankle injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown This week theyll face a Cardinal defense thats been pretty good lately ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Downside Matchups These games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Atlanta Passing Game vs St Louis Defense Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok The team is clearly looking at Hes a dice roll if he starts but its not like Chandler was consistent Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but its tough to count on this team The Rams rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense For the nd week in a row Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up Tennessee for yards and TDs Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of choice again This week theyll face a Steeler defense that ranks in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with yards and a TD Sunday Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos in the league Theyll face a Bear defense this week ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks Clearly the stats dont quite back up their rep lately For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyve been stingy allowing FF points Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isnt that day Really puts the Cris Carter Randy Moss owners in a bind Normally they re sure starts but now Im not so certain He really looked bad at times Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I still think youll have to look hard there Plus its on Monday night so even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in theyll probably put forth a good effort The Ravens rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Kerry Collins went over yards last week and that was something Tiki Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing pretty much equal attention The Packers rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with TDs and Interceptions Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all about Curtis Martin Especially with the Oakland Corners The Raiders rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Rich Gannon had an excellent day with yards and TDs although he did have the Interceptions Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball The Jets are in a must win situation and rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so theyve been tough Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week and better things seemed to happen He threw for TDs and nearly yards James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back onto the scene Theyll face a Buc defense this week ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think He had yards passing on attempts for an amazing yards per attempt Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but thats pathetic This week theyll face an Eagle defense thats ranked in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Defensive Slam Dunks These games feature a Defense thats been very strong lately Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense Start David Boston You already know that Id say Plummer merits consideration in lots of leagues too Boston again went nuts last week The Redskins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Even with this tough matchup Boston is a sure starter unless youre comically loaded at WR Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense Van Pelt threw for under yards but the Bills did get the win It looks to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now Eric Moulds and Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things The Dolphins rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start Sounds funny but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday He threw the ball all over the field Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger were especially involved The Cowboys rank in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last weeks so itll be tough For the year they rank Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email

Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Prime Matchups These games feature Defenses that havent been strong lately Buffalos Shawn Bryson Travis Henry Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense Bryson ran wild again rushing

Points Allowed to RBs St Louis Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense Start Faulk The question will be of course how much he plays but it was pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play Trung

Falcons rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Even Matchups These games feature no real advantage either way Arizonas Michael Pittman vs

games feature a Defense thats been pretty strong lately Cincinnatis Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon showed again he can run on any defense He had yards on carries ypc against the Steelers Hell face the Titans this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks so it won t get much easier They rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Detroits Lamont Warren James Stewart vs Dallas Defense The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren gaining yards on carries ypc Cory Schlesinger did catch passes though so maybe hes worth a longshot pick there The Cowboys rank in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks and in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs Green Bays Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense Green was shut down on the ground with just yards on carries ypc although he did score Go figure Hes still too good to sit in my opinion This week hell face the Giants ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so its a tough matchup although I think Id start Green unless you really have a solid alternative Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense Again Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for yards on carries ypc with a score Hell face the Broncos this week ranked in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last weeks For the year they rank in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs The Broncos are definitely surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes Jacksonvilles Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense Mack went off last week with yards on

<13594518.1075863021422.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryant@cheatsheets.net,2001-11-26 17:23:47,Footballguys Update Week Upgrade DowngradeHi Folks Once again our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this weeks Upgrades and Downgrades Enjoy Joe Upgrades QB Tom Brady Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the return of Drew Bledsoe from injury Some analysts may question the fact that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury but no one can question Bradys effectiveness on the football field A yard touchdown performance keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter Keep in mind the Patriots have a bye in week QB Kordell Stewart Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second consecutive multiple touchdown game Stewart finished the game with passing yards rushing yards and total touchdowns The schedule looks good for Stewart down the stretch especially with games against Detroit and Cincinnati in weeks and QB Jay Fiedler Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris Chambers Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season but his upside is good A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats QB Alex Van Pelt Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson Van Pelt has been a fantasy star With two consecutive yards games to match with touchdowns Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents Look for another quality performance against the ers this weekend RB Dominic Rhodes With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season Rhodes has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense He produced on Sunday with total yards and touchdowns Two consecutive difficult games against Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down but a strong finish to the season is in store With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions look for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes RB Antowain Smith Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with total yards and touchdowns However now is the time to trade Smith away His value has hit an alltime high and the remainder of the season will be difficult with Cleveland Miami and a bye week remaining RB Ahman Green Green has struggled the last few weeks but was able to bust out on Thanksgiving Day with total yards and scores Look for the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the season As the winter weather approaches Favre and the passing game will become more conservative which will result in more dump off passes to the talented Green Dont be surprised if Green receives touchesgame the remainder of the season RB LaDainian Tomlinson Tomlinsons statistics have suffered over the last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run In order to get the ball in Tomlinsons hands more often Turner called several short passing plays to get LT in the open field The plan was successful as Tomlinson caught passes for yards The fantasy playoffs look good for Tomlinson with Oakland Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks and RB Garrison Hearst Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with rushing yards and touchdowns In the last games Hearst has averaged rushing yardsgame With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on Sunday to go along with an already injured quad Hearst will continue to see touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs as long as he remains healthy WR Derrick Alexander Good news for Alexander ownersit appears that he is healthy for the first time this season WR Eric Moulds Throughout the week Moulds was complaining about the lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him Well the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball What happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds He produced yards and touchdowns WR Chris Chambers The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with receiving yards and fabulous touchdowns Chambers is the big play threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action Keep in mind Chambers is a boombust option at receiver Hell dazzle you one week and disappear the next week This guy is going to be special so grab him in dynasty leagues WR David Boston Plain and simplethe man A few weeks ago the knock on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring Well touchdowns in weeks should quiet the critics WR Kevin Johnson Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday with yards and a touchdown Johnson is Tim Couchs clear cut receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the season WR Troy Brown Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent basis With catches for yards and a touchdown on Sunday Brown continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady Keep in mind New England has a bye in week so Brown will not be available for the majority of championship games Plan accordingly Downgrades QB Trent Green Greens disappointing season continues He looked good with passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday However he was unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade With the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver Greens stock could be on the rise in the near future Greens value is at its lowest point so you could probably get him for relatively cheap Hes not an every week starter but he might have a few big games left for this season QB Donovan McNabb McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the last two weeks passing yards and touchdown His pride of wanting to be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production McNabbs value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some plays Right now McNabb should still be considered a top fantasy quarterback However if his lack of production continues his stock will drop quickly QB Brian Griese Grieses receiving options are limited which is directly affecting his production Rod Smith limped through Thursdays game with an ankle injury A healthy return of Smith will boost Grieses stock However Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver position His production is limited if he is forced to throw to the tight end position the majority of the time QB Daunte Culpepper Culpepper did not passscore a touchdown for the first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week RB Anthony Thomas Thomas was held out of Sundays game with a hamstring injury Hes expecting to play this weekend against Detroit but this is not a guarantee With James Allen being effective it would not surprise me to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs A big game looms in two weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that game RB Emmitt Smith Smith was held to yards on carries during the Thanksgiving Day game Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game Smiths numbers will remain meager RB Ron Dayne With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option in the rushing game Daynes fantasy value has dropped very low Dayne had yards on carries Barber had rushing yards on carries receptions for yards and a touchdown Keep Dayne on your bench RB Jason Brookins Brookins broke his foot in Sundays game against the Jaguars He is expected to be out for weeks Drop him and add someone else to the roster RB Eddie George Georges disappointing season continues with yards on carries this past Sunday George is currently tied with Randy Moss for Fantasy Disappointment of the Year RB Maurice Smith Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to return to the game However Smith gained a meager yards on carries and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain Evaluate his progress later this week WR Jimmy Smith Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after being pulled over by police No legal action will occur but some sort of suspension could be handed down by the commissioners office Not a good sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs WR Peter Warrick Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland on Sunday He was held to reception for yards and has not scored a touchdown since week of the season Keep him on your bench until the Cincinnati passing game reappears WR Randy Moss Moss was held to yards on catches Sunday night Moss is the most talented receiver in the league but appears to lose concentration from time to time Keep in mind his potential for explosive games is enormous Waiver Wire Keep in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and team leagues QB Alex Van Pelt Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson Van Pelt has been a fantasy star With two consecutive yards games to match with touchdowns Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents RB James Allen Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and performed admirably With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury its highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this weekend Chicagos defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on the ground RB Travis Minor With Lamar Smith averaging just ydscarry over the last games Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon In his limited touches Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a much needed spark WR Chris Chambers This guy is good See description in upgrades section TE Eddie Boo Williams I had Williams on the list last week and his play on Sunday deserves another mention Although he had just catches for yards Williams has explosive potential He nearly scored on a yard pass play but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury Williams is a tight end with quality upside Bryant Analytics Inc All Rights Reserved To unsubscribe from this group send an email to Your use of Yahoo
