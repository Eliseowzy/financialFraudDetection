<8726771.1075862884598.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,hwc@cwnyc.com,2001-11-02 10:40:04,FollowupNext StepsKen Let me expand on some of issues we covered in Houston earlier this week Some of this is outside my purview but want you to have the benefit of my objective outside reasonably wellinformed perspective Please call to discuss any of this at any time Establish your own internal advisory group to plancoordinate all company actions during this period Meetcall with full group at end of each day to assess develoments adjust strategies set next days actions In my view that group should include Bowen Derrick Delainey Frevert McMahon Tilney I am happy to participate at any time Id assign specific tasks to this core group and other senior execs as follows Bowen new IR point person Have him visit and revisit sellside analysts provide update on status of core business financing promise ongoing communications full disclosure renewed commitment to candor clarity I can help prepareadvise him on this new role Derrick monitor SEC investigation shareholder suits etc Keep tight leash on MacLusas and Wilmer Cutler Engage outside lawyers in discussion of SEC leak strategy endgame and public relations implications I have considerable experience in this space and would be happy to talkwork with Derrick to insure that the public face of this SEC investigation is seriously evaluated as part of Enrons SEC strategy Delainey have him spend his time meeting calling talking with wholesale and retail customers Quite similar presentation to that Bowen delivers to the Street Humility candor commitment to continue serving customers should be core thematics Frevert have him devote his time to calling on talking with international customers with similar messages to those delivered by Delainey Also have him take charge of wholesale reviewpotential revamp of Enrons performance reviewcomp programs This is where Herb Allison Merrills former COO could be helpful McMahon hes your point person with lenders ratings agencies Id also have him work with Tilney to construct the clearest case statement possible explaining Enrons strategy for is core businesses and why they are so compelling Suggestion Irwin Stelzer is the single best writer who can simplify complex issues that I know He s offered to help I encourage you to have him see whomever he needs to see and then write the Enron business strategy story Hed also be a great spokesperson and advocate with Wall Street Might be worthwhile having Bowen take Irwin to a few key meetings with sellside analysts I think Irwin would be a huge asset in that role Tilney have Beth make sure that every communication from Enron internally and externally is clear concise candid and responsive to each audiences needs and expectations She should manage Mark Palmer and his staff Kekst people and any other communications resources internal and external that should be brought to bear druing this period Whalley have him spend all his time with your traders and those among counterparties with whom he is a critical factor Id keep him away from the Street and from the media Kean have him focus solely on regulatory and legislative audiences He should personally work federal and state regulators Capitol Hill members and staff and present updated presentation about the companys business status of financials status of internal reviews and SEC investigation I do think Steves core presentation should be vetted carefully by Derrick McMahon and Tilney before he goes on the road Palmer Id leave it to Tilney as to whether Mark should continue as principal spokesperson for Enron Dont know if Tilneys right but I do think you need a new face and voice to the media Koenig Id pull him back have him work under Bowen to craftrefine presentations to the Street in close coordination with MacMahon and Tilney As we discussed I think Koenig is damaged goods on the Street right now Lay I think you should act as the general who sets strategy deploys your senior human assets and motivates your troops I think you should orchestrate every strategic action of the company talk regularly to employees selectively call on strategic customers and reassure the world that Enron touches that you are in charge hands on and doing everything possible to guide this damaged ship into safer waters Encourage the board Special Committee to prepare an Executive Summary of its report to you and the board that is entirely suitable for public consumption I would be happy to help craft and edit that document Assuming the report fundamentally exonerates the company this is a critically important document You must assume that this report will become public eventually It is be prepared and submitted with that clearly in mind Retain a second investment bank to augment Goldman My suggestions talk with Jeff Holzschuh at Morgan Stanley or Bruce Wasserstein at Dresner Kleinwort Wasserstein Lehmans top energy people are gone and I think Rick GordonMerrill is seen as too close to you Ive gone on too long Let me know how I can be specifically helpful to you andor your colleagues Ill stay in touch via voicemail or email if and as I have specific tactical suggestions Ive available to you or your colleagues at any time Harry Harry W Clark Managing Partner Clark Weinstock office cell home office
