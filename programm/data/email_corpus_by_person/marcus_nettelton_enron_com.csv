Behrends mailto LGMCOM Sent Wednesday October PM To Nettelton Marcus Catherine McCarthy Cc Sager Elizabeth Yvonne Coviello Subject RE Draft of Market rate filing Marcus Here are the others points I wanted to make just briefly I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file Heres why FERC as you know is about to issue a new rule on marketbased rate eligibility In the meantime theyve been kicking out a very high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up reasons Ie issuing deficiency letters on issues we know they dont care about I think the real reason is they dont want to issue a lot of approvals until the new rule comes out No matter how perfect our filing is were liable to get kicked out too They might not want to give MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new rule The best way to deal with that is to sit down with staff go over the draft page by page and see what more they want But that would take too long because of staffs schedule The second best way is for me to call Dan Larcamp or Mike Coleman at FERC tell them that were not in a huge hurry but we really dont want a deficiency letter read him the language in the draft about how well comply with the new rule and see if thats good enough If he suggests different language well have to put it in there Alternatively if we really want to try to slide this through without saying anything to FERC in advance we can file it and just hope that the language we have about complying with the new rule is good enough But thats really not what I would recommend If we do decide to call FERC I could call right away and probably get an answer in time to file today If not then certainly tomorrow Otherwise were pretty much ready I really do think that we could ask for days without raising any eyebrows Good luck and
