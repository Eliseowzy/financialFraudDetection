<12144849.1075840207882.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.sherrick@enron.com,2000-09-07 10:17:00,JanusAs I was walking back to my office reflecting on our conversation there are three points that I mentioned but I think got lost in the discussion This needs to be a stock deal to avoid Indian tax poorly written preferential purchase language and govt approval Still requires RBI approval All of the numbers I have in the document assume a stock transaction RIL is very tax advantaged currently and for the foreseeable future they will be in an NOL position therefore at the numbers we are discussing they should see this as an unleveraged return opportunity of stock purchase fully taxed with no basis to stock purchase shielded from taxes Btax scenario Again the tax position makes RIL unique for this transaction and a very likely buyer at these numbers Few other parties will be as positioned to consider a stock transaction of a company with minimal Indian basis accept the operational conditions and be able to close as quickly The idea of coupling the other India assets with the EP is a good strategy if your goal is to ultimately sale but time is unimportant Ive done multiasset deals before with a major and the bureaucracy rivals India The due diligence on the multiple assets will eliminate any chance of closing this year In fact I would be surprised if we could even get a PSA signed before yearend on a multiasset deal plus the govt approvals become more complex If the goal is money in the door before I favor a buysell at Kens number If we go to October and dont get the documents in place we really havent lost anything because there is little likelihood of closing under a traditional scenario even if we start today We will prepare our dataroom while the negotiations on the documents take place and be ready to bring in bidders by October If we buy at these numbers I believe we can flip the deal within months if not sooner since we have operatorship critical mass a major would covet only one partner and Reliance is not a partner Also If we elect to go to a traditional auction I would strongly suggest we keep the EP separate from the other India assets at least initially to run the auction with the best chance of getting a PSA signed before yearend We can always combine them at a later date during negotiations once we see how the process is going Too many pieces right out of the box will be very cumbersome and time consuming If we have to combine them to get interest we can do it as we see the need for an enhancement My final thought if we do an outright sale to RIL not a prenegotiated buysell with stipulated closing dates etc they will want to do a certain amount of due diligence and rightfully so They would expect and probably demand the same considerations as any other buyer including a dataroom visit to pick our brains one more time Again this becomes a time issue Under the buysell scenario we have devised there is no due diligence period the structure of the deal is stipulated and everything is handled via representations and warranties in the prenegotiated PSA Let me know how and when you wish to proceed I will pursue with complete dedication whichever option you select Thanks for the time to share my thoughts jeff
<16737882.1075840208051.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.sherrick@enron.com,2000-09-08 09:44:00,Project JanusI thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my hand writing can be somewhat difficult to read Before you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D Ambani phone call I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the risk of Enron being an EP buyer I know the implications of making a large EP purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement but I believe with the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little rd party information you may feel more comfortable making this decision Under the buysell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present but I believe the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit My goals for Enron are three fold a sale the assets b get cash in the door before yearend and c get fair value for the assets given the current situation My comments touch upon five topics Reverse the buysell process giving Enron the control vote Pay the Penalty Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliances Financial condition Thoughts on nonReliance bidders Information and the future process Reverse the BuySell Process The plan outlined yesterday using the buysell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals The risk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer versus a desire to be a seller I firmly believe if we make one change to the plan as described below we can increase our probability of a successful sale to near If we dont use a butsell arrangement I am concerned that we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year In fact I suspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems which in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee problems When you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buysell concept with RIL making the first bid to purchase Enron then has the right to sell at that price or increase the bid by and RiL must sell Since we are now in the control position the tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is valid so I would describe the as a control premium The only reason we want the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number I would suspect them to bid in the to million range They just turned down my offer to purchase their assets at mm and indicated we were substantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue They know Enron paid million just months ago for the same position We know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a strong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control It is possible that RIL would bid less than million but I put that probability at less than one percent This reduces Enrons risk dramatically and increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met We also get an added benefit from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder because this will strengthen the perception that we Enron want to be the buyer which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one legitimate buyer Reliance If we pitch the deal as suggested above we need to recognise going in that they probably want the control position as well I believe they would pay a very large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding first they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not getting the deal at all I would suspect that they will at a minimum suggest we flip a coin to see who bids first Initially I would just say no but we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on if it is a deal killer If we did flip a coin we would wait until the documents were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no backing out without a penalty In this scenario it would actually help get a more impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding sequence until after the drafting was finalized Pay the Penalty While it is not the way we want to do business the worst case scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit million if we elected not to follow through in an Enron buy scenario Considering the upside to the buysell under either sequence Enron first or RIL first it may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario I want to think about this over the weekend but while I was thinking this afternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable Contact someone at Janus Fund This was suggested yesterday and I would strongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry Janus bought approximately a position in RIL about months ago I think you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their desire to make the upstream a key part of the company Thoughts on Non Reliance Bidders I have spent a lot more time thinking about this issue I can talk you through the reasons but as long as Reliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a nonoperated working interest we will have to take a huge discount to fair value I will be very surprised if we could get million Again going to the Shells BGsetc early on in the process I believe is a huge mistake both internally and externally Information Flow and Process Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel compelled to mention this to you I am concerned about too many people knowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with the intentions of helping but actually causing problems This needs to be managed by one person not three or four To meet all of our objectives this has to be an orchestrated deal from a to z I think you know more about my background then most others in Enron I worked the EP MA business for years and did pretty well at it I know the oil business and I believe that is a key to getting a good deal done I know these assets and all of the complex issues surrounding the assets our subsidiaries tax issues and the book considerations Im the best person to get this deal done once you decide the risk the company is willing to take I know the limits of my authority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and totally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary Ken I promise you I will use others in the company where and when appropriate If I need help in India I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for such However the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on this deal If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal we need to get a meeting set in Europe at a neutral site to start the process My main objective is to have a successful deal I have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this forward Also I will need your guidance on the future of the EP plans for Enron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna Mukta and Tapti I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can talk to you about that as well if you so desire Thanks jeff

<12767201.1075840235543.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.sherrick@enron.com,2000-09-08 09:44:00,Project JanusI thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my hand writing can be somewhat difficult to read Before you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D Ambani phone call I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the risk of Enron being an EP buyer I know the implications of making a large EP purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement but I believe with the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little rd party information you may feel more comfortable making this decision Under the buysell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present but I believe the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit My goals for Enron are three fold a sale the assets b get cash in the door before yearend and c get fair value for the assets given the current situation My comments touch upon five topics Reverse the buysell process giving Enron the control vote Pay the Penalty Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliances Financial condition Thoughts on nonReliance bidders Information and the future process Reverse the BuySell Process The plan outlined yesterday using the buysell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals The risk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer versus a desire to be a seller I firmly believe if we make one change to the plan as described below we can increase our probability of a successful sale to near If we dont use a butsell arrangement I am concerned that we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year In fact I suspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems which in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee problems When you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buysell concept with RIL making the first bid to purchase Enron then has the right to sell at that price or increase the bid by and RiL must sell Since we are now in the control position the tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is valid so I would describe the as a control premium The only reason we want the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number I would suspect them to bid in the to million range They just turned down my offer to purchase their assets at mm and indicated we were substantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue They know Enron paid million just months ago for the same position We know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a strong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control It is possible that RIL would bid less than million but I put that probability at less than one percent This reduces Enrons risk dramatically and increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met We also get an added benefit from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder because this will strengthen the perception that we Enron want to be the buyer which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one legitimate buyer Reliance If we pitch the deal as suggested above we need to recognise going in that they probably want the control position as well I believe they would pay a very large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding first they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not getting the deal at all I would suspect that they will at a minimum suggest we flip a coin to see who bids first Initially I would just say no but we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on if it is a deal killer If we did flip a coin we would wait until the documents were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no backing out without a penalty In this scenario it would actually help get a more impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding sequence until after the drafting was finalized Pay the Penalty While it is not the way we want to do business the worst case scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit million if we elected not to follow through in an Enron buy scenario Considering the upside to the buysell under either sequence Enron first or RIL first it may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario I want to think about this over the weekend but while I was thinking this afternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable Contact someone at Janus Fund This was suggested yesterday and I would strongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry Janus bought approximately a position in RIL about months ago I think you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their desire to make the upstream a key part of the company Thoughts on Non Reliance Bidders I have spent a lot more time thinking about this issue I can talk you through the reasons but as long as Reliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a nonoperated working interest we will have to take a huge discount to fair value I will be very surprised if we could get million Again going to the Shells BGsetc early on in the process I believe is a huge mistake both internally and externally Information Flow and Process Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel compelled to mention this to you I am concerned about too many people knowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with the intentions of helping but actually causing problems This needs to be managed by one person not three or four To meet all of our objectives this has to be an orchestrated deal from a to z I think you know more about my background then most others in Enron I worked the EP MA business for years and did pretty well at it I know the oil business and I believe that is a key to getting a good deal done I know these assets and all of the complex issues surrounding the assets our subsidiaries tax issues and the book considerations Im the best person to get this deal done once you decide the risk the company is willing to take I know the limits of my authority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and totally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary Ken I promise you I will use others in the company where and when appropriate If I need help in India I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for such However the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on this deal If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal we need to get a meeting set in Europe at a neutral site to start the process My main objective is to have a successful deal I have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this forward Also I will need your guidance on the future of the EP plans for Enron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna Mukta and Tapti I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can talk to you about that as well if you so desire Thanks jeff

<24480755.1075860836434.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.sherrick@enron.com,2001-11-28 17:35:42,RE NonCore Business Response for Consideration Cc Ken Thanks for your message Communication even if it is brief from yo u is absolutely critical at this time While Enron has a very tough road a head I think I can speak for several people on my team that we are support ive of the nonDynegy route regardless of the option we ultimately plan to pursue I know the best thing I can do for Enron is to sell our remaining assets to either BG or another counter party I am committed to this task and we will continue to focus on BG but we need to be prepared that it may be necessary to take a different path to sell the India EP assets In a strange way the termination of the Dynegy merger may actually help the EP sale because it takes away the automatic loss of operatorship ONGC was usi ng as leverage Depending on Enron Corps plans we may have a much stron ger message to play with our Indian partners and the GOI They should be c oncerned that we will keep ownership and operatorship long term and they s hould also be concerned that we will not want to spend the capital to expan d the projects something the GOIONGC really wants to do After you anno unce Corps plan I will go to India and meet with our partners and the GOI in this regard Based on your note below and earlier comments I know the trading business is a key component to your future core operations I am supportive of that decision because I saw the enormous value it can generate in the right cir cumstances As I have mentioned before I think the company should sell bu sinesses such as the EP company that are noncore It is the right thing to do especially in these circumstances However some of the noncore bu sinesses generate good cashflow like the EP company and we have to be ca reful in this environment to make sure the company supports the valuable noncore businesses until they can be monetized I also know most of your senior advisors are disciples of the trading busi ness Because they grew up in that environment they are very comfortable and knowledgeable of this business model and there will be tremendous press ure to maintain certain trading activities or people for the future even wh en the nearterm value is questionable I hope somebody at the table asks the question if we focus our limited financial resources to maintain this future benefit have we lost a valuable nearterm noncore resource I k now these decisions are not easy or clearcut but in this new paradigm th is could happen pretty easily since most of the players at the table do not understand Enrons noncore businesses or what it takes to optimize neart erm value This comment is not intended to offend anybody but it is a conc ern For example Enron made financial commitments of million to our staf f to maintain operations and sell our assets Weve sold everything except EOGIL and we have negotiated mutually acceptable PSAs with two different companies for EOGIL but due to some extraordinary circumstances this has proven to be a tough sale As I mentioned in the first paragraph I think we can get there but it may take a little more time and we need to mainta in staff during the interim I recognize everything has changed due to recent events I am not asking f or a handout because that is the way it was before or anything like that My point is the company will have to make tough decisions regarding which i ndividuals to incentivize and I believe the existing commitments to the EP team should be maintained even though this is a noncore business Reaffi rming the companys commitment to the million will give us a good pro bability of keeping enough of the core staff to achieve our goals and monet ize the assets soon I recognize that million is not a trivial sum of money but without these individuals we stand to lose to million in the next months therefore I have believe this is the right decision for Enron I believe EGEP is one of the valuable noncore businesses but if this be comes a point of controversy I would at least like the opportunity to prese nt my case in person to one of you Thanks for taking the time to read my note Jeff Original Message From Ken Lay Office of the Chairman SentWednesday November PM ToDLGAallenronworldwide SubjectUpdate As you have heard Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today Among other things this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives wh ich we are actively doing As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal and now Dynegys announcement Enrons debt was downgraded to below inve stment grade levels today by SP Moodys and Fitch In response to this action we have initiated a plan to protect value in ou r core trading and other energy businesses At the same time we are neari ng the completion of the business review process announced last week Once this process is complete we will be conducting a comprehensive restructur ing of our business Regrettably but unavoidably this will include the s ale of noncore assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost savin g plan including layoffs We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses retaining our employees who are key to our future s uccess and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties Thi s must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of En ron I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you Althou gh there are no guarantees you should know that we are still in this figh t and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing bu sinesses of Enron All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each othe r stay focused on our work as best we can and stick together while we wor k to overcome these latest challenges Even six or so weeks ago none of us could have imagined that we would be w here we are today We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company As always I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make Thank you Ken

fair value I will be very surprised if we could get million Again going to the Shells BGsetc early on in the process I believe is a huge mistake both internally and externally Information Flow and Process Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel compelled to mention this to you I am concerned about too many people knowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with the intentions of helping but actually causing problems This needs to be managed by one person not three or four To meet all of our objectives this has to be an orchestrated deal from a to z I think you know more about my background then most others in Enron I worked the EP MA business for years and did pretty well at it I know the oil business and I believe that is a key to getting a good deal done I know these assets and all of the complex issues surrounding the assets our subsidiaries tax issues and the book considerations Im the best person to get this deal done once you decide the risk the company is willing to take I know the limits of my authority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and totally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary Ken I promise you I will use others in the company where and when appropriate If I need help in India I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for such However the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on this deal If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal we need to get a meeting set in Europe at a neutral site to start the process My main objective is to have a successful deal I have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this forward Also I will need your guidance on the future of the EP plans for Enron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna Mukta and Tapti I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can talk to you about that as well if you so desire Thanks jeff

Tuesday January PM To Sherrick Jeffrey McMahon Jeffrey Cc Detmering Tim Wallace Stephen Bowen Jr Raymond Subject RE EOGIL sale to BG SorryI forgot to attach the press release File INDIA EOGIL NEW AGREEMENT DRAFT doc Original Message From Sherrick Jeffrey Sent Tuesday January PM To McMahon Jeffrey Cc Detmering Tim Wallace Stephen Bowen Jr Raymond Subject FW EOGIL sale to BG Jeff FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India See Tims note below I spoke to Ray by telephoneon his way to the airport regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering To paraphrase Rays comments to my note below a he is working with the creditors committee on the DO issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the ongoing business At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in midFebruary b the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today As a nondebtor we plan to honor the agreements but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP The hearing date will be in midFebruary Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow form of agreement This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing However BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW A COPY IS ATTACHED WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR John Ambler Johan Zaayman and the working group and now the two of you Do we need to send it elsewhere Well circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim Stephen or I jeff Original Message From Sherrick Jeffrey Sent Tuesday January PM To Bowen Jr Raymond Subject FW EOGIL With respect to the note below we have done the following this morning We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review There are a couple of different documents Retention agreements divestiture agreements and the only differences being names and amounts We have also sent her any associated agreements extensions and assignment She indicated she would review this afternoon My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank None of the people on this list participated in the prepetition retention Lilly has asked about Futhermore none of these people are part of the future plan if there is one to the best of my knowledge On DO supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors see the need for such a plan but they dont want a one off plan as well It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines Once we have the compensation and the DO issue resolved we can notify BG and sign this deal I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues ok on bonuses letter in lieu of DO policy if you can Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion they are just creditor committee issues jeff Original Message From Detmering Tim Sent Tuesday January PM To Bowen Jr Raymond Brian Rosen Email Steve Zelin Email Cc Wallace Stephen Davis Steve Sherrick Jeffrey Harper Stephen Subject EOGIL Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan The Creditors Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations Escrow the proceeds DO insurance will be addressed in the future Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once ie people who got a piece of the prepetition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenrohts mistake I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time Therefore the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds does not provide for separate DO insurance and does not address the deal compensation
