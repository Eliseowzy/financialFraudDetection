Speckman Subject Notice July Meeting for GIA Subgroup Date Wed Jun Organization Krogh Leonard MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetWindows XPriority XMSMailPriority Normal XMailer Microsoft Outlook Express XMimeOLE Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V XUIDL fcbcbfbfdfcedef This email is to alert all members of the legal subgroup working on the Generation and Load Integration Agreements and the Security and Scheduling Coordinator Agreements how about we use GIA Subgroup as a shorthand that we have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday July from to pm in Portland We will announce the specific location when we have figured that out and made the necessary arrangements The basic process I suggest we use to approach the documents that are our responsibility is as follows For the Generation and Load Integration Agreements we need to identify and address areas in which we believe the IndeGO documents need to be modified For the Scheduling Coordinator Agreement we need to work cooperatively with the Ancillary Services and Congestion Management Work Group members who have volunteered work on this agreement using as starting points I believe the scheduling coordinator agreements that have been developed for Desert STAR and Mountain West ISA we also need to compare the example forms of scheduling coordinator agreements with the IndeGO Load Generation Agreement and see if there is any overlap that needs to be cleaned up or any gaps that need to be filled and For the Security Coordination Agreement we need to think through how the relationship between RTO West and Pacific Northwest Security Coordinator PNSC should work what agreements may be needed to document that relationship and whether there are any aspects of the PNSCs current structure or relationships with control area operators that will need to be modified to accommodate the incorporation of RTO West into the security coordination process The basic steps I propose to use to work through each of these agreements are A Identify issues raised with respect to each agreement and then sort and synthesize the issues as much as possible B Offer those who have raised issues a chance to elaborate on the meaning and context of their issues to make sure we all have a good understanding of each issue before we start to work on resolving it C Brainstorm about ways to address the substantive issues that have been raised D Where there is consensus around how to resolve an issue assign the task to someone to either prepare revised drafts of existing documents or develop new documents that reflect the consensus resolution E Where there is controversy or competing proposals for resolution either i develop alternative approaches to submit to the appropriate groups such as the entire Legal Work Group or the RRG for guidance or ii present a description of the unresolved issue to the appropriate groups for guidance and F Where there is consensus and proposed language is prepared and accepted by the Subgroup submit it to the full Legal Work Group for its consideration I hope this seems like a useful approach I plan to prepare and distribute before we meet on July and hopefully with some reasonable amount of lead time a synthesis of the comments we have received so far to help get us started There are also various background documents you can find on the RTO West Web page for our Subgroup which is at GIALIASubgroupagehtm Thank you very much and I look forward to seeing you on July Sarah

contact you This email is intended to get things rolling for the RTO West Legal Subgroup working on the Generation Integration and Load Integration Agreements as well as Security Coordination and Scheduling Coordinator Agreements if necessary First for your reference I have attached the following documents a list of participants in our subgroup the original IndeGO Generation Integration Agreement GIA and the original IndeGO Load Integration Agreement LIA If you know of anyone who would like to be included in this subgroup that does not appear on the attached participants list please let me know I will also post each of the attached documents on the RTO West website at the link on the Legal Work Group page set up for our subgroup Second I would like to share some initial feedback I have received with respect to our assigned tasks A Concerning the Generation GIA I have the following initial feedback Carl Imparato has expressed strong concern about existing provisions in the GIA designed to address instances when hydro generation facility operators are forced to move water through turbines rather than spill it to avoid dissolved gas supersaturation problems James Mosher has expressed concern that the GIA as currently drafted does not adequately address issues unique to Qualifying Facilities and would like us to work on that and Steve Larson of BPA has contacted me to let me know that BPA has developed some initial comments on the GIA and LIA but I have not yet had a chance to have a conversation with BPA representatives about what those comments are I hope to do that sometime tomorrow Thursday June if possible B I have talked with John Boucher who leads the Implementation Work Group and he says that the initial consensus within the Implementation Work Group is that we should begin with the approach that security coordination for RTO West will be accomplished through the existing organization set up in the Northwest to perform security coordination Pacific Northwest Security Coordinator or PNSC which is a Washington nonprofit corporation and C John Boucher says that the initial thinking in the Implementation Work Group about scheduling coordinators as that we should assume that we will have scheduling coordinators for RTO West and therefore will need to develop a scheduling coordinator agreement With that in mind I have also attached to this email an email message from Barney Speckman on this topic Barneys email describes input he has received from Carl Imparato concerning areas in the West that have already developed scheduling coordinator agreements and includes an email from Carl with sample documents I will also post these on the RTO West website as soon as possible along with the basic form of Security Coordination Agreement developed for PNSC I think it might be useful to plan to meet or have a telephone conference call during the week of July early in the week if possible to discuss our various tasks and strategies for accomplishing them If most of you are going to be at the Legal Work Group meeting on June that might be a good opportunity to try to identify a time and date that works for most subgroup members and to decide whether to meet in person or by telephone conference I also hope to make initial cosmetic changes to the GIA and LIA very soon and will put the initial revised versions of those documents on the website as soon as they are ready In the meantime if anyone else has some input they would like to offer with respect to the issues and documents assigned to our subgroup you are welcome to

Subject NWRTOScheduling Coordinator Concept ContentType multipartmixed boundaryFD Barney When IndeGO was drafted several years ago little thought was given to explicitly creating the concept of Scheduling Coordinator As you are aware from the California experience the concept is very important because it defines the roles and duties of the entity that is responsible for handling the needs of unbundled retail customers as well as wholesale customers on a nondiscriminatory basis Attached are two documents The first document provides an overview of the SC concept as well as an overview of what transmission access is really all about in a onepart tariff The document is adapted from the Mountain West ISA tariff and the Desert STAR draft tariff The second document is a recent version not the most current but in my opinion the most rational of the Desert STAR Scheduling Coordinator document The DSTAR document built on the Mountain West ISA document which in turn built on the California foundation I also note that the ERCOT model also includes a Scheduling Coordinator concept although in ERCOT the entities are called QSEs Qualified Scheduling Entities I believe that the SC concept is a very important concept for NWRTO to discuss and adopt It is one of the cornerstones along with the FTR model of the decentralized coordination model which I believe NWRTO plans to consider I do not know which of the NWRTO workgroups would be the lead on the concept although it is very well fleshed out and probably needs little if any additional work Certainly it is important for the Congestion Management Ancillary Services and Implementation workgroups to understand the concept and it is equally important for the Legal group and the RRG to adopt the concept since the contractual relationships between the RTO and grid users are through the Scheduling Coordinator I would appreciate your discussing this issue with project management and forwarding the attached documents to the proper workgroups I will also be available to discuss this at the RRG this Thursday Thank you Carl Imparato NWRTOSchzip
