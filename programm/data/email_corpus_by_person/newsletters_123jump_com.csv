Welcomed SPONSOR Get a FREE Interactive CD Guide to Selecting Winning Stocks and FREE issues of Investors Business Daily No obligation Nothing to cancel Offer available in the US only Subscribers within the last six months are not eligible partnershtmid Overall Sentiment The financial press spent the prior weekend while I was in South Beach apologizing for Alan Greenspans Jan remarks concerning the dim prospects for an economic recovery in Stocks continued to decline It took an actual appearance by the Maestro himself to give stocks a boost In an appearance before a Senate committee the Fed Chairman practically repeated his Jan statements However he also asked that the market interpret them in a bullish light It did The result was three straight days of rally following a selloff on Tuesday in the holidayshortened week of Jan Those up days helped the popular indexes close out the week with slight gains The value of my ShareBuilder plan of stock positions also closed out the week with a slight gain of less than The big winner in this passive buyandhold portfolio for the week was Alliant Tech ATK In the sake of fairness the biggest loser was Micro General MGEN Thats encouraging of course But where will investors mainly the institutional crowd decide to place client money after the flood of Q earnings results subsides Investors Business Daily this past week noted that there were net inflows of money into the overall market during October and November Decembers preliminary figures indicate some net outflow of funds from both stocks and bond funds Indeed the rally since Sept appears to have stalled particularly for the larger capitalization issues in the Dow and the SP The mid and small cap averages although down from levels reached earlier this month have been hit less hard IBD also notes that money continues to flow into value and small cap stock funds and away from large cap and growth funds In the papers Rules for Investment Success section Rule says Find out if the market currently favors big cap or smallcap stocks A check of the daily new highs list does corroborate the trend that smaller capitalization issues remain in favor First Data Corp FDC an SP component and currently held in my ShareBuilder account did reach new highs last week That has been the exception rather than the rule Wednesdays CNBC Squawk Box segment featured a regular guest economist from a Wall Street firm cant recall the firm but does it really matter The economist opined that that the plan vanilla small and mid cap companies would treat investors well in while the Big Dogs would experience a rough and rocky road Unless theyre in the industry many investors dont know about these small and mid cap stocks We tend to shy away from the unfamiliar and prefer to stick with the familiar This worked during the roaring s The bear market of and though has taught us that celebrity stocks can experience periods where only the most devoted of fans stick with them The question investors must answer is Will the market continue to like plain vanilla or it will gravitate to chocolate strawberry and the more exotic flavors More important though is how many scoops of plain vanilla becomes one scoop too many For investors closely watching their investment calories it is something to ponder Observations On my weekly Saturday taxi ride to the supermarket the price for a gallon of regular gas at the convenience store on Market Street was down a whole penny from last week Perhaps prices have stabilized for the moment In fact were hearing the word stabilized a lot these days in the guidance offered by tech companies during the current Earnings Season Tellabs TLAB the telecom equipment firm comes to mind Reports by major brokers concerning the semiconductors particularly the equipmentmaking sector maintain they have seen the bottom When it cones to flavorings in my view it should be taken with the seasoning of your choice Each Earnings Seasons also tends to produce some choppy or erratic trading in stocks Companies can report bottom line results that beat the forecast Still they sell off The usual excuse is that the speculators bought much earlier on the rumor and sold on the news Sometimes a good stock with rosy prospects will pull back after reporting results because some Big Dog stock analyst will say something like Yes earnings beat our forecast but the profit margin for the past quarter was down from the prior quarter and that has us worried So what else is new from Wall Street Meanwhile IBD has begun a regular segment The Smart Investor that profiles individual investors who practice its investing and analytical disciplines After reading this segment for the past few months I have come away with the understanding that these folks dont practice the buyandhold approach as I understand it Instead they constantly look for opportunities to buy a stock that is just beginning its initial break out to new highs Then they monitor its progress from a standpoint of how volume relates to price This means that on average they arent strictly buyand hold investors intending to stick with a position for more than a year much less several years In its most general of terms the best way I know how to explain this approach is to remind regular readers of a situation way back in the early s when I used to hang out in a branch office of a regional retail brokerage firm in a small town in North Carolina A broker was on the phone with a customer He told the customer A good stock is one thats going up and a bad stock is one thats going down William ONeil IBDs publisher puts it this way All stocks are bad Theyre only good as long as theyre going up Portfolio Results Changes In his books audio and video productions Bill ONeil advises that individual investors should maintain a portfolio of just a few stocks This goes against the grain of what is known as Modern Portfolio Theory an investment strategy that stresses broad diversification Quite often I hear the pundits on the TV stock market channels say that an investor should put no more than of available capital into any one position What they are stressing is Modern Portfolio Theory a concept that was created in This strategy is certainly suited for the socalled passive investor or a person that doesnt have the time to spend hours watching the CNBC tape or reading the three sections of the Wall Street Journal from front page to back page every day Indeed diversification is a passive investors best friend Overdiversification however is a hazard for an active investor or a person seeking shortterm performance in his or her positions The market only provides the active investor so many opportunities to enter and exit with a nice gain When that opportunity is missed due to watching too many stocks the overall results often suffer The stocks from the Ones to Watch Model Portfolio that I inherited in February when I was assigned the task of writing this newsletter was eventually whittled down to six stocks These six were purchased at the market open July Six months have passed Lets see how theyve done based on the Jan closing price SEI Investments SEIC from to down Alloy Inc ALOY from to up Pharmaceutical Product Development PPDI from to down Daktronics DAKT from to down EarthLink ELNK from to down SonicWALL SNWL from to virtually unchanged After six months there is only one winner Alloy Inc which is somewhat of a surprise Internet fans should be familiar with EarthLink Perhaps that is the problem facing this sector of the economy and the stock market The company continues to report deals and good news about itself but the bottomline results from the quarter ended Dec and the guidance says this ISP that has to constantly has to compete against giant America Online wont pass muster despite favorable court rulings that allows it access to the same POP telecom lines dominated by AOL Daktronics is a micro cap company that makes electronic scoreboards a business that does well when times are good However times arent so good and the company continues to issue guidance that says future results like EarthLinks that will fall short of Wall Street expectations I have to give up these stocks to what I suppose are the bottomfishers As the saying goes One mans junk is another mans treasure As for the replacements that I hope will make up for a loss and a respectively here are the picks that I will purchase at the market open on Wednesday Jan the second day of a twoday FOMC meeting Internet content company eUniverse EUNI a micro cap company that is beginning to hit the socalled radar screen of institutional type investors read micro cap funds In a PR dated Jan from Los Angeles the company reported a Q profit versus a yearold loss and raised guidance for both revenue and earnings for Q ending March and for fiscal The company recently acquired for between million online advertising firm L LNTY The second pick is PETsMART PETM the No pet products chain Tuesday Jan the Phoenixbased firm raised guidance for its fiscal Q sales growth and said that it will consolidate its PETsMARTcom into its overall operations This company has been running a lot of TV ads lately to retail customers but the company is certainly more diverse than that having catalog operations that sell products to the horse market Believe it or not the US horse market is bigger than one might think Giddyup My waterstock portfolio purchased Aug Tetra Tech TTEK American Water Works AWK and SCP Pool POOL are all in the black with the AWK being the best performer up some I also initiated a position in Philadelphia Suburban PSC a water utility in my ShareBuilder plan on Jan I also intend to add more shares in The two retail positions taken on Jan long Bed Bath Beyond BBBY and short Tiffany Co TIF have thus far been an embarrassment BBBY was bought at and closed Jan at for a paper loss of TIF was sold short at and closed Jan at for a paper loss of Bill ONeil has said the stock market is neither efficient nor rational Heres BBBY a consistent grower in the home furnishing market giving positive future guidance with a trailing month PE ratio of that Im paying a premium to own Meanwhile TIF famous for its Robins egg blue gift boxes sells at a trailing month PE of even though the management projects a growth rate in in the single digits I still track this Sweet portfolio of highprofile tech stocks that was created in late July Space limitations wont permit me to report on the latest results but I will provide a list of the group Business Objects BOBJ Veritas Software VRTS i Tech ITWO Micromuse MUSE Alcatel ALA Nokia NOK Comverse Tech CMVT Vodaphone Group VOD Genentech DNA Network Appliance NTAP Check Point Software CHKP EMC Corp EMC Juniper Networks JNPR CIENA Corp CIENA BEA Systems BEAS Corning Corp GLW Alexander Iliana Maneva A trio of jumpcom correspondents recently issued thoughtful reports on its home page Alexander Vantchev reported Jan on BEA Systems BEAS which I track through the Sweet In an email I provided Alex with this group of stocks and also made particular mention of Business Objects BOBJ the French business intelligence software firm Alex views BEAS as a survivor niche player in the enterprise software space that can manage to hold its own versus the Big Dogs Oracle ORCL International Business Machines IBM and of course Mr Softee MSFT BEAS is scheduled to report earnings in February since it operates on a fiscal that is one month after the traditional periods that end in DecMarchJuneSept The URL for Alexs report SEE storyhtmtoryid In some brief email correspondence with Alex I asked him about the Russian stock market the best performer of all the worlds exchanges in the past months And dont even look at Eastern European markets Alex replied if you dont know more than a lot about them They are not real or at least they are much much different from those in the West These numbers can be anything local lords want them to be Russian economys margins are virtual Nickel Paladium Norilsk Nickel is produced in Siberia by what is very close to slave labor Gas Gazprom OGZPF just runs down a pipe and someone controls the tap In the East the politicians control the business and not the other way round as elsewhere Given what has happened with Enron ENE American investors might tend to quibble with that last statement in Alexs email Speaking of the nontraditional fiscal year the overwhelming majority of American retail companies complete their fiscal year Jan They do this because of what they like to call the Christmas SellThrough Season that also accounts for the period in January when they mark down items in order to rid their shelves of excess read the stuff that didnt sell inventory In other words when it comes to retail investors should be mindful of what I like to call the Philadelphia Department Store Marketing Philosophy Get it off the shelf its been on the shelf too long Come February jumpcoms retail correspondent Iliana Sahandjieva will have her hands full digesting the latest financial results from this broad and diverse group that actually makes up twothirds of the US economy On Jan Iliana issued a report on three discount retailers each with the name Dollar in their corporate monikers SEE storyhtmstoryid Given what has happened to KMart KM one group of financial pundits is saying that WalMart WMT Target TGT and the upandcomer Kohls KSS will continue to take market share from the original creator of discount retail which was first known as EJ Corvettes The other group of pundits is saying that by declaring bankruptcy KMart is a great speculation But the same has already been said about Enron and Exodus Communications Monday Global Crossing GX joined the growing list of companies seeking Federal protection from creditors Meanwhile the retail distributor of lottery tickets gets a little cut from each purchase In other words buy it at cents sell it at cents Its something to ponder When it comes to getting that little cut from each purchase Ill stick with the position in my ShareBuilder plan of First Data Corp FDC Moving on to mumpcoms third correspondent Vanya Maneva we come to an emerging branch of technology known as nanotechnology SEE storyhtmstoryid In a report issued Jan I would have to agree with Vanyas assessment of this technology that it is something for the future something along the lines of at least years into the future Going back to an earlier time in when I used to correspond with a colleague prior to its purchase by Jumpcom about the biotech industry I mentioned that Watson Crick discovered the double helix in My colleague commented that it took nearly years for this scientific breakthrough to actually become a profit making enterprise for only a handful of biotech firms I think Vanya has provided a balanced yet factual approach to this emerging branch of technology Of course folks that have an interest in this field would like to see Wall Street bring these companies public on an ASAP basis much like the dotcom mania IPO market of So far Wall Street is taking a wait and see approach Dont hold your breath for nanotech The Paradox of the Fed As was promised in an earlier newsletter that I would make comment about the Federal Reserve System which we now usually refer to as simply The Fed it seems that the more things change the more that they appear the same Yes we all know that Alan Greenspan former Jazz musician has been at the helm of the worlds most powerful Central Bank for something like years Still I want to remind readers that the Federal Reserve System was created through an act of the US Congress in There are what I would term constitutional sticklers among the readership who maintain that this legislation were it ever to reach the US Supreme Court could actually be declared unconstitutional We all know this wont happen at least in the years that I left as an inhabitant on the Big Blue Marble Given the recent comments from Alan Greenspan and how it affected the stock market I think that it is appropriate that I include a passage from Richard Neys The Wall Street Jungle a book that was published in and is now only available through usedbook sources Because the Fed is part of the financial community under the aegis of the Stock Exchange see Chapter the values and the ideology of the Exchange have become absolute and now impose themselves on the credit policies of the nation The Feds wisdom in raising interest rates is now revealed as no more than a myth in the words of Congressman Wright Patman for the Fed to raise interest rates in order to cure inflation is like pouring gasoline on a fire to put it out I find it interesting that during and Alan Greenspan constantly bitched about inflation as it pertained to the price of a gallon of regular gas before the various branches of the US power structure while also providing his usual oblique explanations as it pertained to the economic concept of wage push inflation From The Readers Larry W emailed with the following comment about a stock hes strong on as is Wall Street these days I enjoy your comments and have been getting your emails for a couple months When you bought MIMS for your nieces I checked it the next day and it started down and I placed a buy order at to think to steal it on the way down It never filled and I now I kick myself for not accepting the good fundamental and just buying with stops I later saw it in IBD highlighted in yellow Larry W continues Another yellow stock is UTSI which is a California company with a near pure play on the wireless market in China Last fall I did a tour of the major Asian cities and could see the great amount of development UTSI has Asian officers in their midforties and a growth rate of about but also a PE above that level They report earnings and have a webcast on Jan PST Visit wwwutstarcom Keep up the reports and weekly trips to the store Meanwhile heres a URL courtesy of Yahoo Finance of UTSI SEE qsUTSIdckcavpstmlonzmqb Sonny Ts Latest Picks Our exIBM employee turned fulltime trader emails me nearly every day about his stock pickingstock trading system Sonny T wrote Sunday Jan that his system is increasing his positions from to per position from a couple of weeks ago to put the profit to work In my view this is a good trading strategy Using the profit to buy more stock actually results in what we are all seeking The Power of Compounding Or as Albert Einstein put it The most powerful force in the Universe at least from an investment standpoint is the power of compound interest When it comes to investing there are winners and losers For those folks who read IBD particularly as it pertains to the Smart Investor segment there are folks out there who make a personal commitment to be consistent winners Or as Sonny T puts it in his latest email My goal is to make money This system provides great opportunity but the trick is to refine a way to make money with it consistently I like the way Richard Ney as it pertains to investment success defined consistency Better a steady dime than a seldom dollar As for the picks Sonny T says his system currently likes AVNT BZH CHBS CTX DFXI DHI FCN FRED GISX GTK LEN MIM RGIS RIT TTIL I find it fascinating that his system has picked Regis Corp RGIS a nationwide chain of hair salon studios Talk about a plain vanilla stock Basing Patterns A colleague Bob Howard who publishes a monthly feebased newsletter from Springfield MO that I receive for free calls his product Positive Patterns Bob is a buyandhold guy who wont back off from his stock picks One of them is a food stock Smithfield SFD Talk about a company that is shareholder friendly if youre a person to use the term this TV celebrity chef Emeril LaGasse uses Pork Fat Rules then Smithfield is the stock for you As for this Basing Patterns business Richard D Wyckoff an early pioneer in technical analysis was always on the lookout for stocks moving sideways within a narrow range Investors Business Daily often writes about stocks displaying stock charts in basing patterns Like IBD Wyckoff who published a newsletter in the first years of the th Century was picky as it pertains to basing patterns Wyckoff and IBD share a common analytical criterion tight as opposed to sloppy base patterns In other words the base should be in a rather narrow range which indicates that speculators are avoiding the stock It also implies that professional investors are making careful bids for the purpose of accumulating a good line of shares at a price that falls within a certain target range Here are charts courtesy of Yahoo Finance that display what I like to call Wyckoff Patterns SEE qsIMNYdckcavpstmlonzmqb SEE qseclpdckctmavpslonzmqb SPONSOR Get a FREE Interactive CD Guide to Selecting Winning Stocks and FREE issues of

Click below for a free quote clksadoukukyuderashusai Overall Sentiment The first official day of what is known among retailers as the Christmas SellThrough Season began early Friday morning Nov In the market research I currently do for Ticker Magazine a Jumpcom property I phoned into SG Cowen in Manhattan that day and the receptionist told me the financial district was a ghost town One of the few days she said when the subway ride from Brooklyn into the financial district was heavenly There wasnt even a crowd outside the local Macys department store We should all hope that a crowd did gather outside Macys as well as the rest of the retail outlets not only in Manhattan but also across the US that opened at am Eastern time that day to receive the throngs of shoppers wanting to get a head start The drive to those retail outlets should be much cheaper compared to how it was just two months ago On my weekly Saturday taxi ride to the supermarket the local convenience store posted its price for a gallon of regular down from from the previous Saturday My driver had predicted a drop to under by Christmas On the drive last Saturday he also mentioned that the traffic was unusually heavy Based on this rudimentary observation of the onset of the Christmas SellThrough Season were off to a good start Still it is too soon to tell For folks curious about how retailers are doing during this period a good source is wwwtelecheckcom a division of Equifax EFX that monitors check processing Meanwhile it has been eight solid weeks of advances for the popular indexes since the last week bottom Sept It should be pointed out that after the prior week bottom April the marker rallied for about eight weeks into early June stalled shuffled sideways for most of that month and during July and then began another slide during August and early September All during that time the TV stock market channels dead tree media and online media continued to trot out the usual gang of chief market strategists who talked about a V shaped recovery in Put it into technology they said They said this in January February March April May June July August September October and of course the final week of November Do you folks think this spiel will change next month or the month after that Sooner or later hope its not later they will be right Overall the charts of the worlds stock exchanges mostly reflect the charts for the SP and the Nasdaq indexes a week bottom on or around Sept followed by an advance to near the day simple moving average SMA There are a few exceptions the most notable being the Russian stock market This market has been among the top performers in as the following link to a oneyear chart courtesy of Yahoo Finance will display SEE qsDmtmsdDckDcpDmm

Investments That Win By Never Losing shows how to make BIG PROFITS without big risks Its FREE Nothing to buy try or cancel Click here indexhtmpromocodeZX Overall Sentiment I spent five days last week visiting Jumpcom headquarters in Floridas trendy South Beach Ironically stock prices also headed south The charts of the popular averages which have mirrored the trend of the typical stock since the Sept bottom have rolled over from the peak that occurred in the first five trading sessions of the year However it should be pointed out that the SP Small Cap Index rallied from a week low to an alltime high during this span of some weeks In the reports I read over the weekend financial pundits blamed Alan Greenspans continued concern for the US economy in remarks made Jan as the reason for the sell off for the week of Jan In the past months especially for technostock fans when all else fails to explain why prices decline one can always blame Dr Greenspan One More Time Whatever the reason the question confronting the trader and the buyandhold investor is Will the recent wave of selling end relatively soon or will it continue a bit longer Moreover if the selling continues will the roughly stocks that rallied off week lows in late September and early October revisit those levels Despite Wall Streets way of making any stock look good no matter how dismal its future prospects in my view investors should take what they say with more than a few grains of the flavoring of your choice The dreams that some investors may hold for their favorite tech stocks of returns and substantially higher in the next months should be weighed against what I believe is the reality of a weak recovery in the second half of the year As always the financial media maintains its focus on the familiar read the Big Cap names and the stocks that rallied the strongest during while paying a modicum of attention to emerging companies many of which virtually ignored the bursting of the Tech Balloon In many respects this balloon is still deflating while money continues to seek other places where it believes it will be treated well The lesson Richard D Wykcoff an early pioneer in technical analysis of equities observed that the stock market does repeat the same patterns but not always with the same stocks A good example of how the market in a stock can remain out of favor for years and then take off for the stratosphere can be demonstrated in the max chart courtesy of Yahoo Finance for Adobe Systems ADBE the leading maker of graphics software used in Internet and Desktop publishing SEE qsADBEdckcavpstmylonzmql As one can observe Adobe stock enjoyed a steady appreciation from to From to a period of three years the share price was locked in a narrow range Only the most resilient and confident of longterm shareholders held on during this slow period of no significant appreciation After the end of the bear market in October Wall Street discovered the Internet or did the Internet discover Wall Street Being a prime source for software used in Web page design Adobe stock soared on an astounding acceleration in quarterly revenue growth and of course profits Now the market in the stock accords Adobe a month trailing PE ratio of times earnings even though the management has warned Wall Street that the company may experience singledigit annual revenue growth in This matter of PE ratios that dont match up with expected future earnings still has many professional money managers uneasy about committing large amounts of capital into high profile tech stocks Observations In the work Ive done for Ticker magazine beginning last October Ive learned from my visit to HQ last week that the December cover story on College Savings Plans generated the most reader response since Jumpcom acquired the property in Folks who read this newsletter can access the article by going to wwwtickercom This savings plan is the result of federal legislation that has many tax advantages for investors concerned about securing a higher education for their children and grandchildren It is also extremely complicated Ticker will publish more articles in the future about this plan I wholeheartedly encourage readers to investigate this investment venue In my view it will be an issue of increasing importance in the next decade After I returned from South Beach on Friday Jan I had a conversation with Mark the groundskeeper where I reside in Wilmington NC After giving a brief synopsis of my visit Mark offered his observation that of the US population wants to live on either the East Coast or the West Coast and that over time the middle portion of the continental United States will be empty That might be a stretch in the shortterm but I would want to encourage readers to view a map of Australia As some of us are aware this island continent is comprised of two geographic areas the Coast and the Outback of the population resides along the coast It is something to ponder On the drive back to Wilmington I picked up a Public Radio broadcast from some Florida college by a television professor who hosts a weekly show about the Internet Goodness knows there are fewer Internet outlets out there that talk about nothing but the Internet for the truly addicted in order to bolster their confidence and to remind them that Yes I am still in the right business instead of majoring in restaurant management On the drive back to Wilmington I got off Interstate and took the Coastal Highway or US through Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina Obviously I encountered lots of stoplights and retail shopping strips but that was my intention to get a feel for how business was faring during the winter season in these areas that do most of their business during the warm weather months To be honest these areas along the Carolinas and Georgia coasts have evolved into yearround regions with enough fulltime populations to keep businesses operating months a year While DotCom and TeleCom stocks were bombing in the past months the stocks of recreational vehicle makers have rewarded the patient investor Stocks from the group include Winnebago WGO and Coachmen Industries COA True the advances havent equaled how well Internet Capital Group ICGE did from summer of to January The folks who cashed in their profits from ICGE stock are now building second homes and using the interest from what is left over to provide them with a comfortable lifestyle Whats CNBC they ask The biggest problem we encounter every day is deciding where to go for dinner Yes even for the wealthy life is still inherently problematical Meanwhile Warren Buffett the Oracle of Omaha along with a host of other stock market sages tell the public via outlets such as CNBC that investors should tone down their expectations in the current decade Since Buffett admits he doesnt understand technology he sticks with businesses such as insulation and carpets Can these companies appreciate in the next ten years Certainly Will they score fold fold even fold gains in this time span Not likely Will they make millionaires out of some investors Yes provided they started out with an initial investment stake of Based on the Rule of or a rough guide for how many years it takes for an investment to double at a certain rate of annual appreciation at a year including compounding reaches million in about years But what about us groundlings still working on those first five figures of net worth much less the Holy Grail or as Bob Brinker prefers to call it the Land of Critical Mass occupied by those folks worth seven figures In a nutshell there are three ways to achieve Critical Mass First is buy low with up to of available capital and sell high Second is buy high with up to of available capital and sell higher Third is give up your day job and trade like hell with up to of available capital The first two require some patience and the ability to withstand these painful corrections the stock market experiences every six months to three years The third alternative requires that an individual investor relinquish most if not all of his or her understanding of financial fundamentals and concentrate entirely on the twists and turns that all equities experience in the short term even down to a few seconds It should be pointed out that the most difficult alternative is the latter and the most addictive in nature I may as well be honest and call it for lack of a better term gambling Still gambling is a profession provided one adopts a professionals attitude and treats it as a business Lastly a check of the price for a gallon of regular gasoline based on what I read on the sign before making the turn onto Market Street was down from The February oil future also called the nearby contract that trades at the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX ended the week at a barrel and very close to the low for the past months I think the oil traders are wondering about what kind of deal was stuck was by George W Bush and Vladimir Putin last December that may override the efforts by Saudi Arabia read OPEC to reduce daily output in an attempt to shore up prices for its basket of crude oils Nobody talks much about that meeting between these two world leaders because nobody including the Washington Press really understands what happened Meanwhile the Russian stock market remains the best performing of all the worlds stock exchanges in the past months It is something to ponder versus all the ongoing talk since about the importance of China as it pertains to American and European companies and their international expansions into Chinas telecom infrastructure Personally I find it fascinating to observe On a global scale I want to remind readers about something Walter Wriston the former of CEO of Citibank which later became Citigroup after its merger with Travelers Insurance once said about investing At any given moment the supply of available capital is finite yet there are an unlimited number of places where it can go It will tend to go to those places where it believes it can be treated well Weekly Portfolio Results Given what has happened to me in the past week its been a struggle to figure out what the results were for the stock portfolios I maintain for the regular readers This waterrelated portfolio of three stocks for the week ended Jan works out this way American Water Works AWK ended the week at an alltime high Shareholders approved the companys pending acquisition by RWK a German water utility at a share Tetra Tech TTEK the water pollution consulting firm that does a lot of business with the US Government finished unchanged since its purchase date Aug at a split adjusted a share Ginney wrote this past week about not receiving shares after the recent for split and what should be done about it A couple of days later she wrote to say that the certificates showed up in the mail By certificates she means actual paper documents that signify ownership In this age of online transactions how many of you readers out there actually possess physical stock certificates SCP Pool POOL the distributor of swimming pool supplies also finished flat since the Aug purchase at a split adjusted Based on what Ive written about people wanting to live on the coast in the US and how much people seem to want to be near water in general I think that over time my investment will in this stock a component of the SP Small Cap Index as is Tetra Tech will continue to appreciate Isnt it interesting after October how stocks outside the technology sector have performed on the upside I wish they could have done as well as Panera Bread PNRA another SP stock in the past months Meanwhile the stocks from the original Ones to Watch Portfolio including Exodus Communications which declared bankruptcy are all but forgotten except for the diehard readers from those bygone days As it stands now a lot of money from retail investors has poured into Enron on the bet that they can double their money from cents a share or whatever the going price is these days to cents a share And then what The share price bombs again to cents a share and all these retail speculators bet on a bounce to cents a share Still thats a double Someone betting at two cents a share becomes a millionaire before shortterm capital gains taxes if the stock doubles to cents a share It takes all kinds to make a stock market the speculators betting on dead cat bounces in bankrupt stocks to the so called true investors that examine the possibilities for a possible double in something like five years Meanwhile the stock portfolio I created based on the July market price at the open has produced only one winner Alloy Inc ALOY up roughly since the purchase at the market open on July The rest SEI Investments SEIC Pharmaceutical Product Development PPDI Daktronics DAKT EarthLink ELNK and SonicWALL SNWL are all in the red The biggest loser is EarthLink down more than from the purchase price July at Coming up is the sixmonth period that ends Jan for these six stocks At least one of them will have to leave at a substantial loss guess which one while the others may or may not remain Regular readers that keep up with retail stocks are aware of how well several have done in the past months The gains arent on the same level compared to how Internet Capital did in six months during the Internet Mania period from summer of to January Meanwhile I recommended a long position in Bed Bath Beyond BBBY purchased at at the market open on Jan The stock closed at Jan I also recommended a short position in Tiffany Co TIF at on the same date at the market open The stock closed at Jan Im losing on both positions Not by a lot mind you but a loss on paper is still a loss I still keep up with the stocks Ive been tracking since late July I call this group the Sweet Tech Portfolio They all rallied since the Sept Attack on America to some degree some more than others However in the past five to ten trading sessions the charts for these stocks display what is known as a rollover pattern that is similar to the popular indexes Stocks from the group displaying this pattern include Veritas Software VRTS I Tech ITWO Micromuse MUSE Alcatel ALA Nokia NOK Comverse Tech CMVT Vodaphone Group VOD Genentech DNA Network Appliance NTAP Check Point Software CHKP EMC Corp EMC Juniper Networks JNPR CIENA Corp CIEN Corning Corp GLW The remaining duo that havent turned south in the past ten trading sessions are Business Objects BOBJ and BEA Systems BEAS Sonny Ts System Picks Our former IBM employee turned fulltime trader wrote this week to say his trading system since October is up versus the Dow plus SPY plus FFF plus and the QQQ plus In his latest email Sonny T noted that conservative stocks such as Wm Wrigley WWY Philip Morris MO and BBT BBT have held up well during the bear market I would also note that small cap stocks outside technology have also performed well as many readers can attest As of Saturday Jan Sonnys system has picked the following stocks Acredo Health ACDO Affiliated Computer ACS Argosy Gaming AGY Direct Focus DFXI Dianon Systems DIAN Global Imaging Systems GISX Gtech Holdings GTK Knight Transportation KNGT Kronos KRON Michaels Stores MIK TTI Team TTIL As always Sonnys system places stop loss orders on these positions in keeping with the Investors Business Daily method As for my own trading Ive only made two since the beginning of the year both in i Technologies ITWO I am up in this cash not tax deferred account I still hold shares of MTR Gaming MNTG in the custodial accounts for my three nieces Although the stock is down from the recent high of above these three positions are still in the money However had I held on to either Royal Caribbean RCL or MIM Corp MIMS these positions would be ahead roughly instead of It just makes me sick But thats the stock market From The Readers Aside from receiving her Tetra Tech shares Ginney wrote last week to say that she is strong about Nestle NSRGY No one will listen when I write about Nestle NSRGY she says This is a

to the readers last year that suggested other small and micro cap names such as Bradley Pharmaceuticals BPRX Neogen NEOG Ansoft ANST and eUniverse EUNI A reader named ljpj asked for an opinion gleaned from a message on the SUNW board on Yahoo The initial portion reads My trading philosophy is this I watch stochastic waves and moving averages From a stable of high Beta stocks I go long those with high revenue growth rates regardless of profitability and I short stocks with high PEs and little near term prospect of improvement in earnings The synopsis of my reply Stochastic is a technical indicator that measures shortterm money flow to determine whether demand or supply is greater Moving averages refers to the average price measured over a specific time period I often write about day

short term decline Beta is a measure of volatility or the degree of magnitude that a specific stock can move during both bullish and bearish periods in comparison with a known benchmark The usual

these first five days are marked by an advance in the popular indexes it bodes well for the entire year Over the past five sessions the number of stocks making new highs at the Nasdaq and the Stock Exchange has consistently exceeded issues The total of new lows each day has barely reached stocks But this has been the case throughout most of the rally since Sept Clearly the market is building its confidence not only in stocks already displaying good relative strength characteristics It is also finding favor with beaten up issues After some weeks of advance the bargains out there to be had that are based strictly on price are few and far between CNBC regularly features Art Cashen a veteran floor trader at the New York Stock Exchange who provides brief tutorials to the viewerinvestor Arts latest missive was Friday evening in which he advised the viewerinvestor not to pay too much attention to the market fads that will occur this year Instead he advised that folks should buy quality issues on a regular basis What Art described was a mechanical method of investing usually called dollarcostaveraging which is how I buy stocks through my ShareBuilder plan I make no attempt to chase fads with this portfolio of stocks However this doesnt mean money cant be made chasing fads provided you get in relatively early And if you think youre a little late to the party not to worry its quite likely investors will see many fads in Observations On my weekly Saturday taxi excursion to the supermarket the price for a gallon of regular at the convenience store on Market Street jumped two cents to Four weeks ago the price was To me it shows how sensitive fuel dealers are to what OPEC does with its daily production quotas Its not fair I tell you Its just not fair But its a reality we all have to deal with Meanwhile the investment gurus on the TV stock market channels continue to tout oil and gas exploration stocks Most of them have come up off the mat since making bottoms in November and December But can they outperform in a year in which everyone seems to agree will be dominated by a strong rebound in tech stocks Friday Jan was a session in which a few Wall Street firms weighed in with strong recommendations for semiconductor data storage and software stocks Consider this an opening salvo as it pertains to which industry sectors Wall Street will be pushing as the market heads into Earnings Season In my view the intent is to first force investors both individual and professional to dismiss the yearoveryear comparisons of Q results which will be lousy and second to make them focus on the impending economic recovery in the latter half of the year If the January Barometer turns out to the bullish for the entire month it means that the rising tide that began Sept will reach some months of duration At that point Wall Street may begin taking profits in February then follow up with some downgrades of stocks that have advanced anywhere from and in some instances more than But Ive been wrong before The Jan edition of Investors Business Daily in its Internet Technology section featured a brief interview by James Detar with Newt Gingrich the former Speaker of the US House of Representatives According to the interview Newt has become a major lobbyist in Washington for the science of nanotechnology or the construction of things at the molecular and even smaller atomic levels Newt has always liked gadgets However the last question intrigued me You once said schools should give every child a free laptop Newts reply Every child having a laptop would be a breakthrough in the st century A free textbook was a radical idea in the late s Computer costs are declining Theres no reason we cant provide every child with a laptop within a decade Weekly Portfolio Results In last weeks newsletter I mentioned that this ISN Ones to Watch Model Portfolio of stocks would only include the six stocks I picked that actually had a benchmark price based on the market open July To be honest I was simply too lazy to include an entry point for the other nine However a couple of readers emailed asking about yearly performance so I realized I had to provide some kind of measure of performance on which I could be judged It should be pointed out that not every investor begins his or her investment career on the first trading day of the year As it stands here are the six stocks I picked with entry prices and how theyve done since July based on the market close Jan SEI Investments SEIC down Alloy Inc ALOY up Pharmaceutical Product Development PPDI down Daktronics DAKT down EarthLink ELNK down SonicWALL SNWL down The three waterrelated stocks that were purchased at the market open Aug are in the black Tetra Tech TTEK split adjusted up American Water Works AWK up SCP Pool POOL split adjusted up Moving on lets turn to this Sweet Portfolio of high profile technology stocks that Ive been regularly tracking since late July As regular readers are aware these stocks have been steadily declining even before the time I first began writing about them Nearly all of them reached new week lows in a panic selloff after the market reopened for trading Sept Then they rallied Lets do a brief review of each stock Comverse Technology CMVT up from a low of the stock reached its lastest week low in October Its trailing month PE ratio of times earnings is also the lowest among the Sweet The historical fiveyear average growth rate is roughly Vodaphone Group VOD up from a low of the stock reached a week low in August and is roughly ten points below the week high of This is the leading wireless services provider in Europe with a strong presence in the US Micromuse MUSE up from a low of the shares neared in early December before pulling back to and have trended sideways for a the past sessions Heres one poised for a breakout if the tech rally continues Corning Corp GLW up from a low of Corning stock rallied to above a share in the past week on news that management has called back to furloughed workers at its Concord and Wilmington NC plants The news also helped JDS Uniphase JDSU rally above BEA Systems BEAS up from a low of the shares have rallied above the day simple moving average SMA but still see the line currently around as a barrier The stock gained last Friday on an upgrade of the enterprise software sector from a major brokerage firm CIENA Corp CIEN up from a low of the stock rallied above the day line then dipped below it after the company warned that sales wouldnt meet previous forecasts in In my view Fiber Optics networks are still at overcapacity Juniper Networks JNPR up from a low of the stock displays a pattern similar to CIENA in the aftermath of a warning about lowerthanexpected sales Check Point Software CHKP up from a low of the shares continue to advance and are on the cusp of crossing the day SMA Still that is some distance from where the shares traded weeks ago at In my view the market has focused on players in the security software space with smaller market caps such as McAfeecom MCAF EMC Corp EMC up from a low of the volume was well above its month daily norm last Friday in response to a brokerage house touting of data storage stocks Network Appliance NTAP up from a low of this stock is the handsdown winner since the Attack on America trading the farthest above its day SMA In fact the price has returned to the previous high that occurred in May There are still trading weeks left in and anything is possible even a return to levels of a share weeks ago Genentech DNA up from a low of this is a megacap biotech stock at billion The biotech sector tanked during the FebMarch selloff rallied then tanked again during the post panic selloff Biotechs are the trickiest sector among hightech stocks One thing is certain most are wellcapitalized Nokia Corp NOK up from a low of this leader in mobile handsets has made Motorola MOT the No producer look pale in comparison If tech is to recover in then Nokia is a good bet to return to where it traded a year ago at or another from current levels Alcatel ALA up from a low of this French optical networking and telecom equipment maker offered for Lucent Technologies LU last year and was promptly turned down Meanwhile Lucent stock cant get out of its own way trading in extremely narrow range from between and I Technologies ITWO up from a low of it remains the lowestprice stock among the Sweet Still it continues to trade above the day SMA on aboveaverage volume Veritas Software VRTS up from a low of the stock has crossed the day SMA in the past five trading sessions making it the sixth stock to do from this group of stocks since the tragedy Business Objects BOBJ up from a low of this French business intelligence software firm continues to inch steadily higher and is the closest to the week high among the Sweet Conclusion CIENA and Juniper have weakened while much of the overall stock market has moved higher Can we safely say that these two former highflyers are leftovers from a bygone era Be mindful of Art Cashens advice to the CNBC viewerinvestor as it pertains to this fad business and how the market will behave in More Temptation Last weeks newsletter contained a section about stocks trading under that have rallied off extremely low prices under share or lower They basically belong to what Wall Street calls the BB sector I did a check of how they stack up according to ratings supplied by Investors Business Daily at its wwwinvestorscom Web site Whatve Ive found is that these stocks carry an accumulationdistribution ranking of B or above A is the highest based on the past weeks of data More interesting are the relative strength RS rankings versus the earnings per share EPS rankings The RS rankings are very high while the EPS rankings are to be honest dismal compared with the overall market Still this is where the trading action has been in the past few weeks The daily volume figures have been well above the week norm for these BB stocks In fact I have personally traded Ariba ARBA Inktomi INKT and i Technologies ITWO on a few occasions since My trades have been entirely for the day going long only By the time this newsletter appears in email boxes Ariba In Richard Neys The Wall Street Jungle the author supplies rules for investors Rule No Nothing puzzles me more than an investors willingness to pay more than fifty dollars a share for stocks Buy lowpriced stocks Its percentages youre after and youll get them in these stocks in a bull market I still like the Peter Lynch philosophy even when it comes to lowpriced stocks Of the five stocks you buy one will a screamer three will be soso and one will be a dud Aside from the three stocks already mentioned the other two are Clarus Corp CLRS and Commerce One CMRC Then there is a sixth BB stock Manhattan Associates MANH a component of the Standard Poors SmallCap Index In the ComputerIntegrated Systems group which is how IBD ranks Manhattan Associates it has the highest ranking of the stocks in the group It also trades substantially higher than a share closing last Friday at and change with a trailing month PE ratio of It should be pointed out that the other five stocks have no PE since which implies that theyve had no earnings in the past months So what gives Maybe this message from a chat board for i Tech might explain it Based on pure technical reason I doubt fundamental will work in this market this year because economy is bad and PE of not just I but the entire market is ridiculously high Thousands of new laid off works will not help the imaginary economy recovery Uncle Greenspan knows that the market is the economy as CEOs made decisions based on market prices Greenspan is pumping money anywhere from to billions of repo money in the system everyday The repo money is being used to prop up the market In short PE does not matter for the time being And I simply has a very good chart with very strong accumulation Please note that this is purely a trade and not a suggestion for anything longer term than the second Greenspan slowing down the printing press This message from a chat board that mentions these repos has a large influence on the prevailing direction of the US stock markets much less individual stocks More about this subject in another newsletter Sonny T Returns From Japan I spent nearly one hour on the phone with Sonny T a former IBM employee who has turned to fulltime trading using a system based on William ONeils CANSLIM method Sonny whose wife is Japanese spent the holiday season with her parents in Tokyo He reports that apartments rent for a month On his return Sonny says that he has resumed trading but he is still working on the notion of trading for a living If he does hes going all the way by setting up his trading systems as a business Among other things this means filing with the IRS for professional traders status Since he doesnt have a full weeks worth of data for the software he uses Sonny said that he would email me his latest picks and trading results in a spreadsheet after a full week is completed He did mention his system likes Hotel Reservations ROOM an online travel services firm that is majority owned by Barry Dillers USA Networks USAI Diller has sold his TV and movie divisions to Vivendi V the huge French entertainment conglomerate leaving him with a wad of cash to develop his online holdings that also include TicketMaster TMCS and Expedia EXPE Lets wish him luck for trading fulltime is extremely difficult IBD Retail Rankings Last week I submitted two picks from the retail sector one long and one short due to reader interest and the fact Jumpcom has moved its Internet reporter Iliana Sahandjieva to cover retail companies My long pick of Bed Bath Beyond BBBY a steady grower in the home furnishings segment was purchased at the market open Jan at It finished the week at for a gain of My short pick of Tiffany Co TIF a leader merchandiser of luxury goods was entered at the market open the same day at The shares finished the week at for a loss of Investors Business Daily gives Bed Bath Beyond an overall ranking of or A while Tiffany Co is rated or A With Tiffany carrying such a favorable ranking this short pick is a contrary play My chief reason for going short is the stock price is still wellbelow the week high and didnt rally as powerfully as other retail stocks in the aftermath of the tragedy In the RetailMiscDiversified Group that includes BBBY the current leader is Gart Sports Company GRTS ranked first in overall technical and attractiveness ratings However Gart Sports is weak in fundamentals with an EPS rating of only But the oneyear chart looks good SEE qsgrtsdckcpmm Whats also interesting to observe is this sporting goods retailers market capitalization of only million which barely qualifies it as a smallcap stock Can the bullish trend for smallcap
