for the Enron Credit Collapse When Could You Have Known What Could You Have Done IMAGE IMAGE The fall of Enron the fall of the CalPX and the fall of the fi rst giant PGE have each been significant wake up calls to the industry The Power industry is an uncertain and volatile market rife with price regulatory and other market risks To the unprepared it may seem that di saster strikes unexpectedly and without warning In reality disaster is n ever all that sudden although our realization of it may be sudden and as such unprepared Looking closely at the most recent fall that of Enron warning signs have been present for some time indicating that all was not right with one of the worlds leading energy companies The current clamo ring of credit agencies and financial institutions is akin to the reaction a flock of birds has after one of their own has been killed by a predator too little too late The market participants that retain their composur e are those that can foresee events coming There are tools and methodolog ies available to the market savvy that allow for the mitigation of credit and other risks Still application of these tools requires significant kn owledge and skill but more so the rigor policy and corporate resolve to use the tools available Access to a utility specific credit analysis an alytic tool like ZE PowerGroups Credit Risk Manager CRAM application wo uld have provided preemptive warning signals As the share price dropped a score reflecting low solvency would have prompted a reduction of Enron c redit limit ultimately flagging the account early on months prior to Enr ons current situation Each downgrade by an agency would have generated a lower credit limit ultimately flagging the account when it hits the firs t unacceptable level Consistent downgrades would have put them on a cre dit watch list When the financial statement was pulleddeclared inadequa te corporate credit policy could have dictated the cessation of any furth er trading with ENRON without security The demise of Enron was months in the making average stock prices have been falling from the start of Interested parties watched as credit rating agencies such as Moodys Fitch and Standard Poors decreased Enrons credit outlook These declin ing credit ratings signaled the beginning of the end for Enron as corporat e debt was called again and again The asset light corporation was unable to stave off the downward credit spirals that ultimately lead to bankruptc y At its height Enron and its EnronOnline trading site were averaging over billion in trade transactions per day Enron was once the countrys top buyer and seller of natural gas and the No wholesale power market er The company operated a mile gas pipeline system and marketed and traded metals paper coal chemicals and fiberoptic bandwidth Enro ns bankruptcy is recorded as the largest case in history encompassing billion in assets and affecting employees Its shares went from to in a span of months CRAM would not have been able to predi ct a low of share nor could anybody for that matter but the system would have capitalized on all signs and provided the proper warning signa ls The figure below shows an example of how the CRAM rating of Enron base d on a sample credit risk policy has changed over the last year IMAGE What is interesting to Note is that the CRAM system in the last year ha s never rated Enron highly The Table below describes the CRAM scoring and rating system Please note that the table is only a sample as could be de rived for a small public utility CRAM is a tool that enables the developm ent and implementation of a corporate credit policy it is not the policy IMAGE Based on this specific rating system Enron never scored above putting it into an N CRAM rating moderate risk The first CRAM cred it alert would have come right in the beginning of the year in January wh en the rating would have been downgraded to N and a much higher risk of d efault ie market reactive By July and with a CRAM rating of N Enron would have been rated as a high risk with insufficient financial strength Trade with Enron would have been severely curtailed This down grading w ould have called for possible contract adjustments and demand for collater al depending on whether the corporation had safeguards in its credit poli cy and contracting Before December CRAM had rated Enron as an NN or a p arty with which no trade can occur By using the CRAM transactions with Enron would have demanded caution from throughout and there would hav e been severe constraints on contract amount type and duration As can be seen by the scoring table the CRAM would have progressively and aggress ively reduced exposure to Enron over the year to a point where the largest contract would have been small manageable and for short duration The co ntinued downgrades would have placed Enron on the Credit Watch List and tr ansactions would have required manager approval and most likely collateral Having a rigorous credit policy and the means to implement it could ha ve minimized if not avoided any credit risk exposure to Enron and in the best case scenario allowed the corporation to unwind highrisk deals as cr edit strength of the counterparty fell CRAM primarily determines counte rparty credit limits as well as clients own credit transactional limit ations Through a series of ratingagency evaluations user defined criter ia and detailed counterparty financial profiles the system dynamically c reates and tracks counterparty credit and transactional limits to manage and minimize clients credit risk exposure CRAM utilizes these inputs to assign a clientspecific credit rating monetary trade limits and maximum contract lengths for all counterparties These limits are used to ensure corporate credit and risk tolerances are not jeopardized prior to authoriz ation being given to execute a trade As an independent tool the applicat ion immediately enables clients to determine their existing credit risk ex posure and begin ongoing near real time counterparty monitoring and ass essment processes The applications effectiveness is further enhanced whe n integrated with the full suite of ZE PowerTools applications IMAGE ZE PowerGroup offers a variety of services to enhance client credit analy sis and credit mitigation CRAM is only one tool that ZE PowerGroup

Trade Information on a Timely Basis IMAGE IMAGEPrice Views Market Views Credit Views An Unforgiving Ma rket Deciphering and responding to elements driving the changing competitiv e power and natural gas markets is an inordinately complex task The chal lenge has proven to be too difficult for even some of the largest players those which have appeared to be the most stable and capable The plights of Enron the California Power Exchange SDGE and PGE highlight the diff iculties that sophisticated market participants and regulators face when t rying to manage change The Enron collapse in particular should drive ho me the extent of exposure that interconnected counterparties and market pa rticipants face The market is impartial and unforgiving From the biggest to the smallest the public and the private all face similar risks and have similar needs The major ratings agencies and the financial community have begun to focus heavily on the risks and information requirements of the power industry We as active market participants must also be concer ned about these risks taking steps to identify measure and mitigate them as much as possible In most cases the difference between success and fa ilure depends on whether you have access to the right data and are able to use it in the right way in a timely manner Maintaining a competitive a dvantage and surviving the volatile swings of transacting in competitive e nergy markets requires having access to and being able to interpret and r espond to the right data before such information becomes commonly obvious Hindsight is
