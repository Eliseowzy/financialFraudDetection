and Other Contingencies Litigation Enron is a party to various claims and litigation the significant items of which are discussed below Although no assurances can be given Enron believes based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established that the ultimate resolution of such items individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse i mpact on Enrons financial position or results of operations In several parties the Plaintiffs filed suit in Harris County Di strict Court in Houston Texas against Intratex Gas Company Intratex Ho uston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company collectively the Enron Defendants each of which is a whollyowned subsidiary of Enron The Plai ntiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase co ntracts with Intratex many of which have terminated Early in the c ase was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried or otherwise res olved separately In the first matter the Plaintiffs alleged that the En ron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connectio n with the Panhandle program a special marketing program established in the early s This case was tried in October and resulted in a ver dict for the Enron Defendants In the second matter the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certa in gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs gas ratably wi th other producers gas at certain times between and The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims On March the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial courts class certif ication was improper and remanded the case to the trial court The Enron D efendants deny the Plaintiffs claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses including the statute of limitations The Enron Defendants beli eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to vigorou sly contest the claims Although no assurances can be given Enron believe s that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material ad verse effect on its financial position or results of operations On November an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Buildi ng in San Juan Puerto Rico The explosion resulted in fatalities bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property San Juan Gas Company Inc San Juan Gas an Enron affiliate operated a propaneair d istribution system in the vicinity but did not provide service to the buil ding Enron San Juan Gas four affiliates and their insurance carriers wer e named as defendants along with several third parties including The Puer to Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Puerto Rico Telephone Company Heath Consultants Incorporated Humberto Vidal Inc and their insurance carriers in numerous lawsuits filed in US District Court for the District of Pue rto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico These suits seek damages f or wrongful death personal injury business interruption and property dama ge allegedly caused by the explosion After nearly four years without dete rmining the cause of the explosion all parties agreed not to litigate furt her that issue but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to det ermine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and if so the lawful damages attributable to such injury The defendants agre ed on a fund for settlements or final awards Numerous claims have been set tled and ten cases involving plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the U nited States District Court beginning on December No cases have yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court Although no assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or resul ts of operations Trojan Investment Recovery In early Portland General Electric P GE ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating faci lity The Oregon Public Utility Commission OPUC granted PGE through a g eneral rate order recovery of and a return on percent of its remainin g investment in Trojan The OPUCs general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to liti gation in various state courts including rulings by the Oregon Court of Ap peals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUCs order including the Utility Reform ProjectURP and the Citize ns Utility Board CUB In August PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff o f the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGEs recovery of its invest ment in the Trojan plant Under the agreements the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking ele ments of the settlement on September As a result of these approv als PGEs investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to c ustomers either through a return on or a return of that investment Colle ction of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the set tlement agreements or the September OPUC order With the CUBs wi thdrawal the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the lit igation The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a retur n on its investment in Trojan Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions Although no assuranc es can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matte rs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or res ults of operations Other Contingencies Environmental Matters Enron is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations These laws and regulations requ ire expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to r esult in increased operating expenses These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enrons financial position or results of operations Enrons natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater reme diation on a number of their facilities Enron does not expect to incur ma terial expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation Developments in the California Power Market During prices for wh olesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors including higher natural gas prices reduction in a vailable hydroelectric generation resources increased demand overrelianc e on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply California s regulatory regime instituted in permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels The resulting disparity betw een costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of Californias public utilities Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE and Southern California E dison Company SCE to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power cost s and certain obligations related to the difference between third party pow er purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers PGE and S CE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstandi ng obligations including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange the Power Exchange from the California Independent System Operator the Independent System Operator and from qualifying facilities In addition PGE and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary pet ition for bankruptcy Various legislative regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situati on in California have been implemented or are being pursued and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere Additional initi atives are likely at the Federal state and local level but it is not poss ible to predict their outcome at this time Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utiliti es the Power Exchange the Independent System Operator end users of energ y in California and other third parties and is owed amounts by certain of these entities Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its expos ure to developments in the California power market Due to the uncertainti es involved the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adv erse impact on Enrons financial condition or results of operations India Enron indirectly owns of the net voting interest in Dabhol P ower Company Dabhol which owns a megawatt power plant and is constru cting an additional megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasif ication facility collectively Phase II in India Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non recourse to Enron Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State E lectricity Board MSEB the purchaser of power from Dabhol and the Govern ment of Maharashtra GOM and the federal government of India GOI the gu arantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of th e power purchase agreements PPA and the other project documents The con tract disputes relate principally to a the failure by the MSEB to pay cer tain capacity and energy payments under the PPA and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documen ts and b MSEBs statements that MSEB has rescinded the PPA and MSEB is therefore no longer bound by the PPA As a result of such disputes the Ph ase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts for nonpayment There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolv e such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement However Dabhol believes that the MSEBs actio ns are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA and Dabhol intends to pu rsue all available legal remedies under the project documents As a result of these disputes the megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB Further Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II E nron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact on Enrons financial condition or results of ope rations
