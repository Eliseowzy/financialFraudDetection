huge return available to the company that will take the tax risk We just have to find that company Dan Forwarded by Daniel ReckHOUECT on PM Kevin NRON PM To Daniel CT Tim CT cc Stephen H CT Subject The Way Forward Dan in response to your question yesterday it should still be possible to get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank DB had contemplated In that respect last weeks IRS announcement leaves things unchanged Thats the good news However in light of last weeks IRS announcement DB is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming Pacificorps existing letter rulings which they have told us was critical to them It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a nonstarter from their perspective at least based upon the present plan of operations Tim is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their runofmine coal consistently with their existing rulings I doubt it but if not we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to do a coal deal with Pacificorp I believe that Pacificorp still needs to unload their facilities and they may still be able to leverage off of their existing rulings which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS Without a deal with DB what are our options now First it is important to recognize that we still have options The IRS has not killed synfuel There has not been any change in the substantive law Last weeks announcement was just that an announcement of the IRSs point of view The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business which has been an important source of comfort to many investors but not necessarily vital Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having a private letter ruling from the IRS generally in reliance on an opinion of outside counsel We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks like in the absence of getting a new ruling One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorps facilties meaning we would relocate them and continue running runofmine coal the IRS be damned and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than Pacificorp In short we would need companies who are willing to rely on Pacificorps existing rulings period along with an appropriate indemnity It seems to me that if the price is right someone ought to be willing to step up While the risk is now greater the potential returns are potentially mindblowing and an equity player ought to be able to get an opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits notwithstanding the IRS current view of the law It seems to me that this is the only approach that makes sense Alternatively Pacificorps facilities could revert back to being a pure coal fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRSs recent announcement The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that process waste coal fines so such facilities could still qualify for new private letter rulings The IRS announcement defines the term waste coal fines very vaguely not specifying either the coal size or what it is that makes coal fines properly viewed as waste coal fines If you think in lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their announcement I can envision that Enron could synthetically create waste coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility customers to provide for the sale of only coal of inches or greater resulting in a residual category of unwanted coal that we could separately market to synfuel plants as waste coal fines In other words they could be fairly described as waste insofar as another coal customer specifically excluded it from their contract In addition the IRS announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output as some commontators had feared which is a helpful development because the pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity However there are real difficulties with this approach First the relevant language in the IRS announcement defining waste coal fines is not real statutory law It is basically just an IRS policy statement meaning that we cannot bind the IRS to it So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the IRSs choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were statutory law Also Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste fines is fines from true waste ponds Even if the taxpayer can argue over the meaning of the term waste fines the IRS can stick to their understanding of the term at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue a new ruling In short the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly or waste fines incidental to mining operations If you are not going to be able to get a new ruling anyway whats the point of going back to being a coal fine processing facility But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines generally ie not merely waste coal fines as well as runofmine coal Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more restrictive than the ones that they already have That is truly putting value at risk In my view the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing rulings as essentially above market rulings insofar as they go farther than the IRS currently allows giving them a competitive advantage over other synfuel operators who never got a ruling It seems to me that if they can be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk then we may still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal Kevin Liss x

<7997326.1075852335752.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,daniel.reck@enron.com,2001-10-23 15:36:12,freightGreg I was trying to leave you alone through all this reporting nightmare but Shankman said you are looking for a diversion so Ill set up a time with Liz FYI in Chicago we currently have employees and contractors We are budgeted for a big increase in contractors in but in reality that will never happen If volumes actually demand that many customer service reps we would outsource the first call response to a rd party call center and keep Chicago for questions that couldnt be answered simply and for dispatch Also we are working on technology which should increase the dispatcher efficiencies If volumes dont materialize downsizing contractors is easy The budget has the contractors in it as a place holder for costs associated with transaction growth One way or the other we will have to bear the marginal transactional costs On the space issue we do have extra space available but its really close to a free option We decided last spring to sublease out the webmodal space in Lombard and move to the Enron space downtown When we looked at all the support costs and the marginal cost of occupying the extra space downtown it was basically a wash The extra seats are there if we need them Ill explain more when we get together Regards Dan
