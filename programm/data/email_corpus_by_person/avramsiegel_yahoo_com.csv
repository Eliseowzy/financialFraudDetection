recall you saying that you guys were leaving on the st which I hope is the case Anyway hope that this finds you before you depart First if you didnt buy a Plan du Paris map of Paris in English on your

arrondissements map of the subway system etc OK here goes Its been a while and I dont have my Plan with me here in Mexico so Im working from memory Hope that its helpful Once youve bought your Plan you can reference my suggestions and get yourself oriented link the walks together etc For an exotic and cool experience go to the Mosque La Mosquee in French Its in the southeastern part of the city th arrondissement or th Go the cafe in the mosque and have tea Its just very cool La Rue Moufftard sp It starts on the top of the hill where the Pantheon is across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens Its a neat little street that winds down the other side of the hill Go before noon when the market fills the streetyou can buy a few things and picnic in the Luxembourg Garden Speaking of the Luxembourg Gardens its a neat place Id take a walk throughcheck out all of the espailled fruit treestruly a work of art Walk to the other side of the Garden opposite from the Pantheon side and find the St Sulpice church Very cool neighborhood St Germain des Pres neighborhood The church is on a square theres a lot of very nice cafes and restaurants and its the site of the famous Left Bank fashion center While youre over there wander to the Montparnasse neighborhood and stop in at the Rosebud bar Hemmingway and the gang drank there Its small the waiters where little white coats and they play real vinyl records of the best jazz anywhere Best of all its not pretentious Its hip Also there is a cemetery where many famous folks are buried including Serge Gainsbourg and Baudelairecemeteries are of course a big deal in Paris the most notable being the Pere LaChaise Cemetery where Jim Morrison is buried Theyre interesting enough but I dont know if Id go out of my way In the Latin Quarter th arrond check out LEcluse right on the river at the Quai les Grands Augustins just off Boulevard St Michel Little wine bar with tasty things to nibble on Great place to take a breather in the late afternoon somewhat in style Mick Jagger The Picasso museum in the Marais neighborhood is an absolute must And while youre there be sure to cruise the neighborhood Very gentrified these days and its the gay neighborhood but been renovated into a lot of very impressive art galleries and fashion housesvery neat While there in the same neighborhood go to the Place des Vosges Unreal big old square from way back whengreat to look at and theres shops and cafes The Institute du Monde Arab is on the Mitterands seven great projects Architechturally magnificent and the exhibits inside are modest and very impressive Rue de la Roquette is now extremely hipon the east side of the Bastille behind the new opera if you get a chance go an opera therevery populist experience and fun Roquette is where the clubs and the musique are General hipdome and if youre inclined to do some real peoplewatching go to Boulevard St Germain and sit outside at Les Deux Magots or Caf Fleure and watch away Find on your map the church St Eustache Walk around east of it for some very cool neighborhood viewingused to be big wholesale butchers and such extension of Les Halles which is now a big shopping mall but used to be Paris outdoor market From there walk to Place des Victoires or Place des Notre Dame des Victoires I cant remember And look for Gallerie Vivienne tooBelle Epoque little food a shopping corridervery neat And finally while your over there go to the Palais Royale by the Louvre which is where Louis XIV grew up as a boyfantastic courtyard controversial artwork black and white striped columns walk to the opposite end exit the courtyard out the back and continue walking in the neighborhood Isle St Louis the island right across from Isle de la Citewhere Notre Dame is is a must Kittykorner from Notre Dame across the bridge is Brasserie Isle St Louis where you can get a beer and a glass of wine and get in on some great local color Stroll down the main street on the island Isle St Louis en LIsle and right off the street get a scoop of ice cream from Bertillion the renowned icecreamery in Paris You can spend a very nice day at the Rodin museum Breathtaking Sacre Coeur is good for the neighborhood more than for Sacre Coeur but worth going to Check out the artwork and roam around for a nice local bar on the hill Polly Magoo on Rue St Jacque by Shakespeare Co is where Mick Jagger hangs out if youre interested Monets water lilies in the basement of lOrangerie is fairly moving at the east end of Tuilleries Gardenseast of the Louvre Ill leave the museums etc to you Sorry to quick and message
