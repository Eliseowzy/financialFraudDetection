IN THIS WEEKS ISSUE Would Government Oversight Be Charitable Drug Law Reform Up in Smoke Battle Brings Out PorkBarrel Politics Why Freedom Matters More Than Ever Independent Policy Forum WOULD GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT BE CHARITABLE The terrorist attacks of September took not only US government officials by surprise Americas nonprofit charities were totally unprepared to handle the huge outpouring of donations they have received in response to the attacks or to quickly dispense the donated funds to the victims families Of the billion collected in the past two months only million has been distributed This has provoked a tremendous outcry from donors and news commentators If the charities dont act quickly to improve accountability and responsiveness to donor intent the critics say federal and state governments may be justified in stepping in Members of Congress even proposed federal and state oversight of the charities during two hearings on Capitol Hill last week Lack of accountability to donors is not a problem that plagues only charities although in the present case IRS laws may be largely to blame since charities must take the time to ensure that aid recipients are legally qualified to receive charity Americas nonprofit foundations have suffered from poor accountability since long before September according to Randall G Holcombe research fellow at The Independent Institute whose book WRITING OFF IDEAS examines the economic cultural and intellectual implications of taxexempt organizations Many of Americas bestknown nonprofit foundations the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation for example have gone far astray from the intent of their founders These foundations trustees and officers typically promote redistributionist government policies rather than the spirit of freemarket entrepreneurship that Henry Ford John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie believed bestowed upon them their good fortune Increased government scrutiny both for charities and for foundations is tempting But as Holcombe explains it is a temptation we better not succumb to If they are too inflexible the charities or too politically correct the foundations without government oversight just think of how much more so they would be with government oversight as specialinterest groups try to pressure regulators to politicize charitable activities We should hope for better performance from foundation trustees and management writes Holcombe But at this point additional government restrictions would be more likely to harm rather than help promote the public interest For a detailed summary of WRITING OFF IDEAS Taxation Foundations and Philanthropy in America by Randall G Holcombe see tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml To

arrested for marijuana possession If you think that this startling statistic is likely to drop in the near future as law enforcement focuses on antiterrorism think again President Bushs new drug czar John Walters who was confirmed by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week shows every sign of increasing enforcement of the nations drug laws despite large segments of public opinion supporting drug decriminalization and a growing number of judges fed up with the governments counterproductive War on Drugs Even medical marijuana clubs that operate with voter approval can expect a crackdown under Walters Despite the predicted escalation of the drug war domestically the Walters regime may leave its largest imprint on foreign lands where US drug laws reverberate even louder but far out of earshot for most Americans To get a take of Walterss drugwar diplomacy When the Peruvian military shot down an airplane carrying two American missionaries claiming they thought it was carrying drugs Walters must have viewed the missionaries deaths as unfortunate but unavoidable collateral damage He did after all earlier praise the Peruvian militarys practice in violation of international law of shooting down planes thought to be used by drug smugglers So unless Walters does something to force his resignation such as have an affair with an intern American citizens can look forward to increased drug incarcerations drug turf battles drugrelated crime and a foreign policy tainted by a marriage of therapeutic rhetoric and preemptive militarism against possible drug smugglers In other words for the remainder of the Bush administration the prospects for positive druglaw reform have gone up in smoke For more information on drug law reform see the transcript of The Drug War on Trial

IN THIS WEEKS ISSUE Revised Draft No Better Than Original The Second Amendment the Courts and the Professoriate Why Smart Growth Isnt REVISED DRAFT NO BETTER THAN ORIGINAL Although President Bush said he would resist efforts to reinstate conscription its growing popularity among the pundit class is likely to make the draft an important topic in upcoming public debate But dont expect this discussion to exactly parallel the debate that led to its termination in Todays war against terrorism is creating a dynamic that is redrawing the domestic political landscape creating new coalitions potentially strong enough to have the draft reinstated Most of the nations political groups have factions that would like to see some type of involuntary servitude be they anticapitalist progressives who want to see the best of the nations youth derailed from the career fast track nationalistic conservatives who want to mandate patriotism and reinvigorate a strong sense of nationconsciousness or Demopublican moderates such as Secretary of State Colin Powell who want youth to make voluntarism a high priority But just as the war on terrorism is like no other war Bush so the next draft is not your fathers draft Charles Moskos and Paul Glastris writing in the WASHINGTON POST make clear that the new draft will be packaged not as a cheap quick way to enlarge the military but as a new form of governmentassisted public expression of the conscripts values ie a form of choice Draftees will thus have their pick among for example the armed services homeland defense jobs such as airport security and civilian nationalservice programs such as AmeriCorps As Independent Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs says some choice Moskos and Glastriss proposal raises several important questions writes Higgs none of which they see fit to consider Perhaps in a followup article they will tell us Whatever happened to the idea that every person even a young man has inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Whatever happened to the idea that a just government is instituted to secure these rights not to crush them underfoot upon the earliest pretext What exactly do we gain if we

tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml THE SECOND AMENDMENT THE COURTS AND THE PROFESSORIATE The most important firearm case in years United States v Emerson was a solid victory for the rights of gun owners One of the strengths of the decision rendered earlier this year by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was its citation of the vast body of scholarship that supports the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment as well as numerous statements made by Americas founders showing that the right of the people to keep and bear arms was intended to protect an individual right This alone will help ensure that the correct interpretation of the Second Amendment will spread as jurists attorneys and law students study the decisions citations for years to come Critics of the individualrights interpretation however have not relented But neither has Independent Institute research fellow and Second Amendment attorney Stephen Halbrook author of the classic book THAT EVERY MAN BE ARMED The Evolution of a Constitutional Right as he made clear in two recent replies to prominent law school professors According to Prof Michael Dorf of Columbia University Law School despite the Emerson decision the individualrights interpretation of the Second Amendment is as much a fraud on the American public as when exChief Justice Warren Burger passed that judgement nearly twelve years ago Halbrook however explains that the Emerson is the first ever federal appellate opinion to contribute an adequate textual analysis of the Second Amendment Thus the decision observed that throughout the Constitution the people have rights and powers but federal and state governments only have powers or authority never rights Further says Dorf the Second Amendment protects only an armed militia as indicated by the preamble A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state Responds Halbrook But as Emerson explains this preamble announces the objective of securing a free state by a militia which in turn is encouraged by and drawn from the people who exercise the right to keep and bear arms Similarly Halbrook easily dispatches numerous other distortions by Dorf Unlike Dorf constitutional scholars Amar Akhil Yale and Vikram Amar UC Hastings have a generally correct assessment about the Emerson decision but are guilty of committing a few historical oversights For example the Amars state that the Emerson court found only one clear nonmilitary use of the phrase before but they overlook numerous statements by Jefferson Madison and Adams explicitly advocating the protection of a right to keep and bear firearms for selfdefense See Reports of the Death of the Second Amendment Have Been Greatly Exaggerated The Emerson Decision by Stephen P Halbrook at

from the aggravation of traffic congestion and contribute to an improved quality of life in our communities according to proponents of the faddish smart growth movement Are these claims true Would we be better off moving back to the cities and junking our cars According to urban economists Daniel Klein and Randal OToole who discussed these questions in our Oct rd Independent Policy Forum Smarter Urban Growth Markets or Bureaucracy the smart growth movement is smart in name only since many of its policies work against their intended goals Smart growth advocates uphold public rail systems in European cities as models but ignore the fact that with few exceptions American cities lack the population density needed to make rail systems costeffective And with good reason automobiles are more flexible faster affordable safe and comfortable And as cars have improved in quality the US urban public transit market has been shrinking Hence cities that build rail systems display little economic sense but plenty of what Klein called infrastructure envy OToole pointed out that the costs of smart growth are significantly larger than its proponents recognize Drawing largely upon the experience of Portland Oregon OToole showed how smartgrowth policies have led to escalating housing prices tied up the of the state that remains rural open space and contributed to bad traffic congestion and air pollution For the transcript of Smarter Urban Growth Markets or Bureaucracy with Dan Klein and Randal OToole see tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml Also see Curb Rights Eliciting Competition and Entrepreneurship

WEEKS ISSUE Phony Stimulus Package Wont Fix the Economy Crisis and Ratcheting Up Government Growth Depoliticizing the Final Choice PHONY STIMULUS PACKAGE WONT FIX THE ECONOMY Although understandably preoccupied with the war on terrorism the Bush administration needs to give some leadership to the economy This means recognizing its own mistakes writes Independent Institute research fellow Paul Craig Roberts in a recent syndicated column For starters Bush should recognize that his tax cuts which are phasedin and temporary rather than immediate and permanent will do little to stimulate investment Furthermore the porkbarrel spending package is not a stimulus it simply crowds out an equivalent amount of private spending and prevents resources from being used more productively writes Roberts As Roberts says the socalled stimulus package ignores the lessons for stimulating longterm growth taught by supplyside economics twenty years ago The solution to the economys problems is obvious and simple Roberts argues Effective immediately abolish the alternative minimum tax accelerate depreciation on a permanent basis and cut tax rates on personal income See Dont Forget the

tiicontentpubsreviewtirreynhtml CRISIS AND RATCHETING UP GOVERNMENT GROWTH The wasteful pork in the recent spending package and the dubious new antiprivacy powers of the federal government illustrate clearly how government grows during national crises Less obvious however is the fact that when the emergencies subside the new programs are seldom dissolved Often they are transformed into new programs or agencies with new missions ratcheting up governments growth The International Monetary Fund is one of thousands of examples that could illuminate this government pathology explain Independent Institute research fellow Steve Hanke and senior fellow Robert Higgs in a new oped for the FINANCIAL TIMES Formed in as part of the Bretton Woods agreement the IMF was intended to stabilize the global financial system by providing credit to countries experiencing balanceofpayments problems under the postwar peggedexchangerate system But when President Nixon closed the US gold window in effectively ending the Bretton Woods agreement the IMF became a multimillion dollar agency in search of a new mission It soon found one The IMF reinvented itself during the oil shocks of the s and in the s with President Reagans seal of approval by subsidizing loans to developing countries Today the IMF is contemplating ways to financially assist coalition partners in the War against Terrorism and to deny funds to lessthancooperative countries Government programs and institutions arent the only things that get ratchetedup during national crises The ratchet continues to operate on ideology too write Hanke and Higgs A recent poll conducted by THE WASHINGTON POST indicates that percent of Americans think the government is run for the benefit of all the people up from percent last year Only percent agreed that the government is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves the lowest percentage since when percent embraced that view It may be too much to expect a speedy end to the law of the ratchet but it is time to acknowledge what is going on That at least may make it easier to reverse the trend during times of stability See Wake Up To the Law of

LEVIATHAN Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government by Robert Higgs at ltncrisisandleviathanhtml DEPOLITICIZING THE FINAL CHOICE One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state governments and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition cripples human dignity is brewing in Oregon where a federal judge recently issued a court order to block US Attorney General John Ashcroft from interfering with the states physicianassisted suicide law Declaring that physicianassisted suicide was not a legitimate medical purpose for prescribing drugs Ashcroft who earier had promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the states had threatened to have the medical licenses of participating doctors revoked Many civil libertarians understandably see Ashcrofts threat as a direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive to allow government interference between doctor and patient However according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz member Independent Institute Board of Advisors the fundamental problem is that our laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide except as in the case of Oregon when it is physicianassisted and even then only under limited circumstances In other words no matter how painfully one may suffer from a terminal illness ones ultimate choice must be prescribed by a physician Undoubtedly this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of those lawabiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to take its course is too long and too painful Drug and suicide law reform however would help restore genuine dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain Physicianassisted suicide writes Szasz in a new oped is but one of the consequences of our drug laws By expanding their range of lawful options drug and suicide law reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into their own hands without interference from the state It would also help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the Hippocratic Oath The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us Szasz concludes The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over in silence or more often are unrecognized We avoid confronting problems of living as moral problems and choose instead to treat them as medical problems It is not a good choice See Assisted Suicide Is Bootleg Suicide by Thomas Szasz LOS ANGELES TIMES at tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml Also see Beware of Pharmacracy by Thomas

never made it off Capitol Hill Many economists critical of the proposed government spending increases have pointed out that the economy had already started to show signs of recovery anyway Other critics correctly point out that the stimulus had enough pork to keep specialinterest groups hibernating high on the hog till next winter There is however another reason to have frowned at Washingtons stimulus proposals and to rejoice at their demise Government stimulus packages are not as environmentalists might say sustainable They merely crowd out or postpone increases in private investment the fuel of economic recovery And when a government stimulus is financed by inflation it tends to undermine the source of that fuel capital formation This holiday season we can thank Congress for its

Christianity and preChristian celebrations of the winter solstice is also an appropriate time to reflect upon the secular values that have helped Western civilization over the course of two tumultuous millennia Among these values freedom of conscience peace on Earth and goodwill toward men These values transcend any particular religion they are in fact articulated in varying degrees by most of the worlds religions Yet they have found their fullest expression in the West Why Because in Western culture more than in any other the individual counts This empowerment of the individual is unique to Western civilization writes Paul Craig Roberts And it is this individualist precept respect for the dignity and worth of each human life that holds the key to understanding the unique institutions of the West The Wests individualism writes Roberts permits an individual person to put his or her foot down to take a stand on principle to become a reformer and take on injustice It has made the individual a citizen equal in rights to all other citizens protected from tyrannical government by the rule of law and free speech Just as freedom in the West has unleashed in the marketplace the progressive forces of what one economist termed creative destruction so freedom in the West has unleashed a similar phenomenon in the marketplace of ideas This perhaps is the Wests supreme paradox and achievement its tradition of questioning even tradition itself Concludes Roberts Be we religious or be we not our celebration of Christs birthday celebrates a religion that made us masters of our

WEEKS ISSUE In Defense of Free Speech Antitrust Settlement Bodes Well for Consumers How the FDA Helped Retard Child Development IN DEFENSE OF FREE SPEECH The intimidation campaign against New York radio talkshow personality Grandpa Al Lewiss website ISP is by no means unique Recent efforts to suppress the voices of ideological opponents are widespread and not limited to one particular ideology or viewpoint While Grandpa Munster drew ire for his outspoken views in opposition to the US government responses to the Sept th atrocities some on American college campuses have been reprimanded for voicing support for the US military response or even for simply displaying American flags according to Paul Craig Roberts research fellow at The Independent Institute It is permissible to burn the American flag on university campuses But dont try waving one writes Roberts in his syndicated column College administrators on some campuses have ordered the removal of American flags from student dorm rooms and school buses and banned the staff of a university TV station from wearing red white and blue ribbons Some professors have also been demoted or had their websites shutdown At San Diego State University one Arabicspeaking Ethiopian student was put on warning when he chastised three Arab students he heard expressing their delight in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon writes Roberts American colleges and universities were once famous for permitting all forms of speech to be heard in the marketplace of ideas Too often today we see one form of orthodoxy

weeks settlement between Microsoft and the US Justice Department is good news for consumers because it does little to hamper Microsoft according to economist Dominick Armentano a research fellow at The Independent Institute in an oped published in Canadas NATIONAL POST The settlement still to be approved by the federal judge assigned to the case and several state attorneys general would require Microsoft to adopt certain specific operating practices namely to stop engaging in exclusive dealing arrangements with computer makers share its Windows source code with competitors and allow computer makers more freedom to display nonMicrosoft software applications Microsoft however has already nearly abandoned its exclusivity arrangements and moved toward an open source arrangment observes Armentano In short the government got virtually nothing from this legal monstrosity of a lawsuit which is precisely what it deserves Armentano writes Microsoft on the other hand is a clear and decisive winner on the issue that first sparked the lawsuit the tying of its Web browser to its operating system Like the antitrust prosecution of IBM in the s and early s the Microsoft antitrust case was without merit and illustrate the need to fundamentally reform or repeal antitrust policies according to Armentano Antitrust has a long and sorry history of prosecuting aggressively competitive companies that have innovated rapidly and lowered prices to consumers And most antitrust remedies attempt to restrain price competition witness the provision in the Microsoft settlement that requires published rates and uniform discounts or make it easier for less efficient firms to do more business Consumers and businessmen need free open markets and they need protection from force and fraud They dont need antitrust regulation and protectionism that hampers innovation and harms society Armentano concludes See Microsofts Big Win by Dom Armentano THE NATIONAL POST tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml Also

Independent Institute points out the FDA could have safely approved the additives years ago but didnt Britain Japan Israel Belgium the Netherlands and more than other countries have been using DHA and AAenhanced infant formula for years but this did not help speed up the approval of the infant formula additives in the United States Consequently millions of babies have been denied the benefits of more IQ points and approximately one line of better vision on a standard eye chart This horror story is but one example in the long history of FDA overcaution Numerous studies have shown that FDA rules and regulations have resulted in high prices fewer new drugs and long delays in getting new drugs to market writes Tabarrok in a recent oped How can the FDA be reformed so that Americans can enjoy the benefits of pharmaceutical innovation more quickly As a good first step writes Tabarrok the US should establish reciprocity agreements with countries that have a proven record of approving safe drugs including most western European countries Canada Japan and Australia If the US and say Britain had a reciprocity agreement for example then drugs and supplements approved in Britain would gain immediate approval in the US and viceversa Such an arrangement would reduce delay and eliminate duplication and wasted resources See Excess FDA Caution Threatens Health by Alexander Tabarrok

IN THIS WEEKS ISSUE Phony Stimulus Package Wont Fix the Economy Crisis and Ratcheting Up Government Growth Depoliticizing the Final Choice PHONY STIMULUS PACKAGE WONT FIX THE ECONOMY Although understandably preoccupied with the war on terrorism the Bush administration needs to give some leadership to the economy This means recognizing its own mistakes writes Independent Institute research fellow Paul Craig Roberts in a recent syndicated column For starters Bush should recognize that his tax cuts which are phasedin and temporary rather than immediate and permanent will do little to stimulate investment Furthermore the porkbarrel spending package is not a stimulus it simply crowds out an equivalent amount of private spending and prevents resources from being used more productively writes Roberts As Roberts says the socalled stimulus package ignores the lessons for stimulating longterm growth taught by supplyside economics twenty years ago The solution to the economys problems is obvious and simple Roberts argues Effective immediately abolish the alternative minimum tax accelerate depreciation on a permanent basis and cut tax rates on personal income See

illustrate clearly how government grows during national crises Less obvious however is the fact that when the emergencies subside the new programs are seldom dissolved Often they are transformed into new programs or agencies with new missions ratcheting up governments growth The International Monetary Fund is one of thousands of examples that could illuminate this government pathology explain Independent Institute research fellow Steve Hanke and senior fellow Robert Higgs in a new oped for the FINANCIAL TIMES Formed in as part of the Bretton Woods agreement the IMF was intended to stabilize the global financial system by providing credit to countries experiencing balanceofpayments problems under the postwar peggedexchangerate system But when President Nixon closed the US gold window in effectively ending the Bretton Woods agreement the IMF became a multimillion dollar agency in search of a new mission It soon found one The IMF reinvented itself during the oil shocks of the s and in the s with President Reagans seal of approval by subsidizing loans to developing countries Today the IMF is contemplating ways to financially assist coalition partners in the War against Terrorism and to deny funds to lessthancooperative countries Government programs and institutions arent the only things that get ratchetedup during national crises The ratchet continues to operate on ideology too write Hanke and Higgs A recent poll conducted by THE WASHINGTON POST indicates that percent of Americans think the government is run for the benefit of all the people up from percent last year Only percent agreed that the government is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves the lowest percentage since when percent embraced that view It may be too much to expect a speedy end to the law of the ratchet but it is time to acknowledge what is going on That at least may make it easier to reverse the trend during times of stability See Wake Up To the Law of

LEVIATHAN Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government by Robert Higgs at ltncrisisandleviathanhtml DEPOLITICIZING THE FINAL CHOICE One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state governments and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition cripples human dignity is brewing in Oregon where a federal judge recently issued a court order to block US Attorney General John Ashcroft from interfering with the states physicianassisted suicide law Declaring that physicianassisted suicide was not a legitimate medical purpose for prescribing drugs Ashcroft who earier had promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the states had threatened to have the medical licenses of participating doctors revoked Many civil libertarians understandably see Ashcrofts threat as a direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive to allow government interference between doctor and patient However according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz member Independent Institute Board of Advisors the fundamental problem is that our laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide except as in the case of Oregon when it is physicianassisted and even then only under limited circumstances In other words no matter how painfully one may suffer from a terminal illness ones ultimate choice must be prescribed by a physician Undoubtedly this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of those lawabiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to take its course is too long and too painful Drug and suicide law reform however would help restore genuine dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain Physicianassisted suicide writes Szasz in a new oped is but one of the consequences of our drug laws By expanding their range of lawful options drug and suicide law reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into their own hands without interference from the state It would also help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the Hippocratic Oath The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us Szasz concludes The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over in silence or more often are unrecognized We avoid confronting problems of living as moral problems and choose instead to treat them as medical problems It is not a good choice See Assisted Suicide Is Bootleg Suicide by Thomas Szasz LOS ANGELES TIMES at tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml Also see Beware of Pharmacracy by Thomas

Environmental Propaganda Agency William Lloyd Garrison Antislavery Crusader PENTAGON SHOCKED TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK Captain Louis Renault Claude Rainess cheerfully duplicitous character in the film classic Casablanca asserted glibly that he was shocked shocked to learn that gambling was taking place at Ricks Cafe Moments later he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night All this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in military construction The investigation concluded that three senior Army Corps of Engineers officials had just as one whistleblowing Corps economist had claimed engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington Post called a billiondollar construction binge on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers The Pentagon investigators concluded that the agencys aggressive efforts to expand its budget and missions as well as its eagerness to please its corporate customers and congressional patrons have helped create an atmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy the Post reports Even the agencys retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were often corrupt and that several Corps employees cited immense pressure to greenlight questionable projects Bureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy But they are hardly news Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five Year Plans only to implement new equally flawed versions so it seems that every few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own centrally planned fiefdom only to present a new Plan that operates under the same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance With corruption and waste seemingly taken care of the worst porkbarrel spenders in

Robert Higgs see tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY Will the necktoneck presidential race help reduce or intensify pressure for the next president of the United States to score points with statist environmental activists Except on a few controversial issues a strong case can be made that the fortythird President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a close friend of the environment President George W Bush for example would face strong pressure to show that he is bipartisan in his approach to environmental protection whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to win back those who supported Nader and the Greens All the more reason then to call attention to the failures of the current approach to environmental protection especially those emanating from the US Environmental Protection Agency or as economist Craig Marxsen terms it the Environmental Propaganda Agency The EPA sometimes employs the language of costbenefit analysis to illustrate its seemingly tremendous success but it is known to employ it in a highly misleading manner The EPA claimed for example that its Clean Air Act programs produced from to trillion dollars in health benefits at a cost of only billion But reports Marxsen in THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW The EPAs study actually represents a milestone in bureaucratic propaganda Like junk science in the courtroom the study seemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than to come as close as possible to the truth In conclusion writes Marxsen Without the illusory benefit of all the lives saved the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably could have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice The Clean Air Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air pollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the most sensitive person in the population The EPA relentlessly presses forward in its absurd quest like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane determination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it For more information see The Environmental Propaganda Agency by Craig S Marxsen THE

moderation I will not equivocate I will not excuse I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard William Lloyd Garrison THE LIBERATOR January December marks the th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd Garrison a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement As the late historian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book AwardFinalist biography ALL ON FIRE William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery William Lloyd Garrison is an authentic American hero who with a Biblical prophets power and a propagandists skill forced the nation to confront the most crucial moral issue in its history For thirtyfive years he edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston THE LIBERATOR which remains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the service of civic idealism Although Garrison a selfmade man with a scanty formal education considered himself a New England mechanic and lived outside the precincts of the American intelligentsia he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work of challenging orthodoxy questioning public policy and offering a luminous vision of a society transformed He inspired two generations of activists female and male black and white and together they built a social movement which like the civil rights movement of our own day was a collaboration of ordinary people stirred by injustice and committed to each other who achieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong and then ridiculed as impossible Indeed without Garrisons inflammatory but compelling writing speaking and organizing there might have been no effective American antislavery movement at all For more on William Lloyd Garrison read historian Henry Mayers talk from the Independent Policy Forum The Civil War

Environmental Propaganda Agency William Lloyd Garrison Antislavery Crusader PENTAGON SHOCKED TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK Captain Louis Renault Claude Rainess cheerfully duplicitous character in the film classic Casablanca asserted glibly that he was shocked shocked to learn that gambling was taking place at Ricks Cafe Moments later he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night All this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in military construction The investigation concluded that three senior Army Corps of Engineers officials had just as one whistleblowing Corps economist had claimed engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington Post called a billiondollar construction binge on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers The Pentagon investigators concluded that the agencys aggressive efforts to expand its budget and missions as well as its eagerness to please its corporate customers and congressional patrons have helped create an atmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy the Post reports Even the agencys retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were often corrupt and that several Corps employees cited immense pressure to greenlight questionable projects Bureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy But they are hardly news Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five Year Plans only to implement new equally flawed versions so it seems that every few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own centrally planned fiefdom only to present a new Plan that operates under the same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance With corruption and waste seemingly taken care of the worst porkbarrel spenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook only to enjoy like Casablancas Renault and Rick an amicable toast to the beginnings of a beautiful new friendship For the Washington Post series on

score points with statist environmental activists Except on a few controversial issues a strong case can be made that the fortythird President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a close friend of the environment President George W Bush for example would face strong pressure to show that he is bipartisan in his approach to environmental protection whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to win back those who supported Nader and the Greens All the more reason then to call attention to the failures of the current approach to environmental protection especially those emanating from the US Environmental Protection Agency or as economist Craig Marxsen terms it the Environmental Propaganda Agency The EPA sometimes employs the language of costbenefit analysis to illustrate its seemingly tremendous success but it is known to employ it in a highly misleading manner The EPA claimed for example that its Clean Air Act programs produced from to trillion dollars in health benefits at a cost of only billion But reports Marxsen in THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW The EPAs study actually represents a milestone in bureaucratic propaganda Like junk science in the courtroom the study seemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than to come as close as possible to the truth In conclusion writes Marxsen Without the illusory benefit of all the lives saved the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably could have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice The Clean Air Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air pollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the most sensitive person in the population The EPA relentlessly presses forward in its absurd quest like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane determination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it For more information see The Environmental Propaganda Agency by Craig S Marxsen THE

moderation I will not equivocate I will not excuse I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard William Lloyd Garrison THE LIBERATOR January December marks the th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd Garrison a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement As the late historian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book AwardFinalist biography ALL ON FIRE William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery William Lloyd Garrison is an authentic American hero who with a Biblical prophets power and a propagandists skill forced the nation to confront the most crucial moral issue in its history For thirtyfive years he edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston THE LIBERATOR which remains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the service of civic idealism Although Garrison a selfmade man with a scanty formal education considered himself a New England mechanic and lived outside the precincts of the American intelligentsia he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work of challenging orthodoxy questioning public policy and offering a luminous vision of a society transformed He inspired two generations of activists female and male black and white and together they built a social movement which like the civil rights movement of our own day was a collaboration of ordinary people stirred by injustice and committed to each other who achieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong and then ridiculed as impossible Indeed without Garrisons inflammatory but compelling writing speaking and organizing there might have been no effective American antislavery movement at all For more on William Lloyd Garrison read historian Henry Mayers talk from the Independent Policy Forum The Civil War

WEEKS ISSUE The Pearl Harbor Deception Challenging the FTCs Hostility to Mergers Will Encryption Protect Privacy and Make Government Obsolete David Friedman Transcript Now Online THE PEARL HARBOR DECEPTION The creators of Pearl Harbor the new movie debuting Friday that Hollywood insiders are calling Titanic with fighter planes have missed a vital aspect of Pearl Harbor history Although the movies emphasis is on entertainment not historical enlightenment during the films production Jerry Bruckheimer the producer made sure to consult Pearl Harbor survivors historians and government officials But one perspective he never took seriously is one based on secret US documents recently declassified under the Freedom of Information Act Overwhelming evidence contained in the May Freedom of Information Act release writes Robert B Stinnett in the new paperback edition of his book DAY OF DECEIT The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor reveals that by midNovember as Japanese naval forces headed for Hawaii Americas radio cryptographers had solved the principal Japanese naval codes and that Japans top admirals went on the Japanese naval airwaves and in a series of radio messages disclosed that Pearl Harbor was the target of their raid Based on these transmissions President Roosevelt and General George Marshall predicted war with Japan would begin the first week of December We would know even more about what FDR and his chief advisors thought but the Japanese radio messages remain incomplete still cloaked in American censorship By continuing to classify Japanese naval intercepts and their communication decoding data as national defense secrets the National Security Agency NSA has done a disservice to the excellent cryptographers and the radio intelligence obtained by monitor stations operated by the United States and her allies in as well as to history itself Nevertheless concludes Stinnett the major secrets of Pearl Harbor are at last out in the open After years of denial the truth is clear we knew Unfortunately this truth will not be coming soon to a theater near you See Robert B Stinnetts oped December A Setup from the Beginning

in recent years Another antitrust case the Federal Trade Commissions successful challenge to the merger of two officesupply superstores will have farreaching effects even if the Microsoft case is ultimately thrown out on appeal The FTC prevented a proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot by arguing that a merger would raise the price of office supplies citing evidence that officesupply prices were significantly higher in cities with only one company operating officesupply superstores The defense accepted this evidence as true but argued that higher prices were explained by higher costs in onefirm markets What they didnt do according to the judge was to offer a unifying theory to explain why onefirm markets might have higher costs Economist Craig M Newmark offers such a theory based on what economists call indivisibility rents in a new Independent Institute working paper In essence Newmark argues that the whole point of superstores is to have a store large enough to minimize the costs of transportation advertising and the like In markets that can only support one store the market is often too small to minimize these costs Hence the higher prices in these markets This theory presented above in the sketchiest fashion is consistent with other evidence presented by the FTC Markets having only two office supply superstore chains were notably smaller than those with three firms suggesting that indivisibility was a factor Unfortunately the FTC apparently didnt consider indivisibility in its analysis The indivisibility theory implies that the higher prices in onefirm markets are not due to lack of competition the merger should not raise prices Consumers and their representatives then should let the FTC know that a kneejerk hostility to mergers isnt in the public interest Checking for indivisibility should be a staple of FTC analysis See The Positive Correlation of Price and Concentration in Staples Market Power or Indivisibility by Craig M Newmark

GOVERNMENT OBSOLETE David Friedman Transcript Now Online Someone once said that the move toward civilization coincided with the move toward privacy New advances in information technology allow the possibility of greater privacy but they also make it easier for government bureaucrats criminals and other unwanted intruders to snoop into your private life Will privacyenhancing technology outpace privacythreatening technology Will freedom and civilization thereby advance Or will the new technology strengthen the rule of Big Brother Economist and legal scholar David D Friedman addressed these and related issues in his recent Independent Policy Forum talk Will Encryption Protect Privacy and Make Government Obsolete a transcription of which is now available on the Independent Institute website Leery of predicting the future Prof Friedman said that he would not forecast beyond years after that all bets are off For the coming three decades however he predicts that public key encryption a young technology increasingly used in ecommerce is likely to promote privacy unless the government acts immediately to control its use Rather than control what people do with personal information about you public key encryption lets you decide with whom you want to share that information With it we can better ensure that financial information health records and other information will only go to those we deem are on a needtoknow basis Further public key encryption along with email remailers can promote anonymity making it increasingly possible for you to buy and sell over the Internet without the taxman knowing about it And anonymous companies in cyberspace can easily build a solid reputation needed to gain a loyal customer base Thus we may soon have an underground cybereconomy that rivals the size of underground economy in the real world Public key encryption also acts as a virtual Second Amendment according to Friedman Just as the Second Amendment to the US Constitution institutionalized the selfdefense of the citizenry against a federal tyranny so public key encryption will institutionalize the selfdefense of the citizenry against government propaganda

WEEKS ISSUE The Regulatory Trap World Freedom Index Why Are the Public Schools Failing and What Can Be Done Next Independent Policy Forum July THE REGULATORY TRAP Californias energy crisis is often portrayed as a failure of deregulation In reality however the restructuring of the Golden States power industry shortcircuited rather than deregulated the market process Legislation that squeezes all buyers and sellers into a shortterm spot market rather than lets them agree on the terms of their contracts imposes protectionist price floors that then become price ceilings and tilts the playing field against new suppliers and distributors can be considered deregulation only in the sense that Sovietstyle economic planning can be considered economic Had California taken deregulation seriously it is likely that electricity would be more plentiful and cheaper than before as in Pennsylvania where deregulation while still not percent is at least worthy of the title But why didnt California legislators attempt genuine deregulation More broadly why is deregulation so seldom attempted anywhere despite the fact the economists routinely take pains to show how regulation is wasteful Economists often argue that resistance to deregulation stems mostly from the fact that the benefits of deregulation are spread out among potentially millions of people while the benefits of regulation are concentrated the few who benefit find it easier to politick for their cause While this is often a factor there are several other reasons why regulations become entrenched according to economist Fred S McChesney First politicians assume that the public can live with the status quo Second deregulation is likely to be entrusted to the very politicians and bureaucrats who oversaw and politically benefited from the existing regulatory regime Third regulations beneficiaries would expect to be paid off by the deregulations beneficiaries Fourth some of the costs of regulation are sunk eg spent on lobbying and therefore cant be recovered by deregulation Fifth the government may well confiscate the gains of deregulation through taxes What McChensey explains is the existence for a stubborn regulatory lockin which unlike the urban myths of market lockin refuted in Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margoliss persuasive book WINNERS LOSERS AND MICRSOFT does not go wanting for empirical examples As many have noted regulation is much easier to get than to get rid of The predictable path once regulation has been adopted is a series of ratchets upward Here McChesney relies on the notion of a ratchet effect described in detail in Independent Institute senior fellow Robert Higgss book CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN Each new government regulation or program creates a new baseline from which it rarely if ever retreats This description of the regulatory state is apt but let us suggest a more vivid one As in the old Roach Motel TV commercials regulations check in but rarely check out This metaphor at

representing percent of the worlds countries can be considered free The report is overly optimistic however it overstates the freedom and understates the repression in the freer countries according to Paul Craig Roberts research fellow at The Independent Institute in a recent syndicated column Hardly any of the indexs free countries are really free writes Roberts For example both the United States and Great Britain fall in the repressed category of the index with regard to tax burden as do Luxembourg the Netherlands and Australia The share of personal earnings collected as government taxes in the indexs freest countries often rivals the onethird taken from feudal serfs by their lords or the fifty percent taken from th century slaves by their masters How can property rights be secure when taxation can claim a feudal lords or slave masters share of a citizens working time asks Roberts Further property rights are seldom fully secure even in the indexs highestranking countries For example US property owners are at grave risk of many federal state and local laws that permit their property to be seized on the slightest pretext In percent of asset forfeitures no charges are brought against the former owners To overlook this great insecurity of property in the United States is to concoct a fanciful measure of property rights What the index really shows Roberts concludes is that there are virtually no free countries in the world See Freedoms Unheard Call by Paul Craig Roberts at columnistspaulcraigrobertsprintpcrshtml For a detailed critique of earlier indexes of freedom see

WEEKS ISSUE Anthrax Panic Hijacks Pharmaceutical Industry If Environmentalists Owned the Alaskan Oil Fields Growing Recognition of a Growing Government ANTHRAX PANIC HIJACKS PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY The Bush administrations recent success in securing low prices from Bayer AG the German drug manufacturer for Cipro its antianthrax antibiotic will ultimately reduce rather than protect the health of Americans according to a new oped by economists Michael Reksulak and William F Shughart a research fellow at The Independent Institute Bayer agreed to slash its prices to the US only because of strong intimidation by the federal government Some in Congress have called for the US government to override Bayers patent protection for Cipro which expires in unless Bayer reduces the price of Cipro Patent protection is especially important in the pharmaceutical industry because it helps ensure that a company can recover its massive outlays for research and development as well as make up for the delays and uncertainties associated with the FDA approval process But letting the anthrax scare break this link between upfront investments and future profits reduces the expected returns to RD and greatly increases the uncertainty of the whole drug development system Reksulak and Shughart write An increase in the number of companies permitted to produce Cipro now or forced reductions in the antibiotics price means that fewer new drugs will be produced in the next to years than would have otherwise been the case Already willing to sell drugs to governments at steep discounts drug makers now have to worry that they may be bullied into accepting even lower returns or face the loss of patent protection altogether By threatening private property rights and undermining the rule of law the US

THE ALASKAN OIL FIELDS Legislation that would permit oil exploration in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR may soon reach the presidents desk US Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle says he will allow the bill to go to a floor vote when there are senators who support it In response many environmental groups most notably the Audubon Society have renewed their strong opposition to drilling in the ANWR Ironically however if environmentalists owned ANWR they would probably allow drilling using the proceeds to help promote their conservation elsewhere according to Dwight R Lee writing in the fall issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW Consider what an environmental group would do if it owned ANWR and therefore bore the costs as well as enjoyed the benefits of preventing drilling writes Lee In fact the Audubon Society does allow oil drilling on an oil field it owns the acre Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana The willingness of environmental groups such as the Audubon Society to allow drilling for oil on environmentally sensitive land they own suggests strongly that their adamant verbal opposition to drilling in ANWR is a poor reflection of what they would do if they owned even a small fraction of the ANWR territory containing oil If environmentalists owned ANWR they might easily conclude that although ANWR is an environmental treasure other environmental treasures in other parts of the country or the world are more valuable Moreover with just a portion of the petroleum value of the ANWR efforts might be made to reduce the risk to other natural habitats more than compensating for the risks to the Arctic wilderness associated with recovering that value This is not Lee emphasizes a recommendation to give ANWR to environmental groups Rather it is a call to recognize that economic incentives matter even to environmental groups An environmental group that refuses to put its money where its mouth is is free to clamor for locking up resources it bears no direct cost for prohibition One that owns resources however faces the reality that wise resource ownership entails the balancing of priorities Unfortunately it is the former type of environmental

Democrats over the size and scope of the federal government the two parties are more or less united now in the view that a strong federal government with expansive powers is vital for the time being Scholars say the expansion in the size and powers of the federal government in response to the terrorist attacks is similar to what has happened in past wars and crises the article continues We are

said Robert Higgs the author of CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government In that respect this episode mirrors the great national emergencies of our past Mr Higgs said If as President Bush implored the country we must not let the September terrorist attacks change our way of life we must resist the impulses that have enlarged the federal government thus

National Security Crisis Likely to Feed Government Growth How the Feds Misrepresented AntiPrivacy Provisions of Law The Drug War on Trial Independent Policy Forum Transcript Now Available NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS LIKELY TO FEED GOVERNMENT GROWTH Military and economic crises have been the twin engines propelling the growth of American government as politicians have rushed through new spending programs and regulations to show the public that they were doing something When the crises passed however government didnt revert to its precrisis size Instead the expansions created new baselines for further government growth according to Independent Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs in his book CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN This ratchet effect is of special concern in the aftermath of the Sept th attacks as Congress gave the executive branch broad powers intended to fight terrorism and prop up a faltering economy according to Higgs in an interview with REASON Magazine When the government takes largescale unprecedented actions of this sort unanticipated consequences always occur says Higgs Then the government has to expand even further to deal with those consequences The ultimate result will

other things expand government wiretapping and eavesdropping powers Unknown to most Americans however is that Congress had already given law enforcement authorities broad powers to expand electronic surveillance in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA according to political economist Charlotte Twight in the fall issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW Among other powers the CALEA gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation authority to track the physical location of cell phone users and to obtain the content of private communications in a variety of circumstances without a probablecause warrant Yet when testifying to Congress about the proposed CALEA the FBIs thendirector Louis Freeh repeatedly claimed that CALEA would confer no new authority on law enforcement officials provide no information about the physical location of cellular phone calls and not weaken existing privacy protections The CALEA episode argues Twight demonstrates that Congress is no match for crafty machinations of bureaucrats expert in masking their true intentions by hamstringing Congresss ability to understand the meaning of new legislation what Twight calls an example of the manipulation of political transaction costs such as the cost of understanding the details of legislation The confluence of CALEA federally mandated electronic databases of personal information Carnivore Digital Storm Echelon and the like have established a web of federal surveillance never before known in the United States writes Twight One way or another we will soon learn that the

ABOUT IT Despite the vast sums poured into drug interdiction and prosecution Judge Gray explained he observes that drugs are no harder to obtain today than when he was prosecuting drug cases Further drugs today are often more dangerous because antismuggling efforts and antimarijuana laws have led drug dealers to supply drug users with more potent drugs Judge Walker explained that the growing number of judges opposing the Drug War are diverse in their political orientation and career experience But he said the judges cannot be the sole advocates of sensible druglaw reform citizens in every walk of life must become better informed about the Drug Wars tremendous economic social and health costs and voice their objections in public Is serious reform possible on so emotional a topic Yes measured optimism is warranted according to the judges Just as communism in Eastern European collapsed quickly and unexpectedly so may the War on Drugs as Americans learn of better approaches to dealing with drug abuse such as those practiced in Switzerland Judge Gray concluded For a transcript see tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml Also see The American Drug War Anatomy of a Futile and Costly Police

Federal Bureau of Incompetence Integrating Immigrants Happy Birthday Patrick Henry THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INCOMPETENCE The American people justifiably feel sickened by the FBIs mishandling of evidence in the Timothy McVeigh case but they shouldnt be surprised according to economist Bruce Benson senior fellow at The Independent Institute The FBIs failure to divulge reams of evidence to McVeighs lawyers is just the latest bungle in a history stretching back to when President Theodore Roosevelt created its predecessor the Bureau of Investigation writes Benson in a new oped Regrettably blunders and coverups are not confined to the FBI Despite coverup attempts similar scandals involving both state and local prosecutors and police show that misrepresentation and even falsification of forensic evidence occurs regularly At the root of the systemic problems that plague public lawenforcement Benson argues is poor accountability Yet strong accountability and its offshoot innovation is the norm in the private sector This according to Benson explains why governments are increasingly contracting with the private sector for police dispatch investigative services fingerprinting crime labs traffic control data processing prisoner transport and other traditional police functions Between and in fact the number of specialized security firms grew by more than percent while employment by these firms grew by almost percent This trend is explained by the simple fact that in police services as in other services customers tend to get what they pay for For example In the private railroad police employed by major railroads had a clearance rate reported crimes cleared by arrest times greater than the clearance rate for public police In the s a private investigation firm was contracted to look into police corruption in small towns in Ohio and West Virginia Within months the firms efforts led to more than arrests After a drug scandal in the town of Sussex New Jersey replaced its tiny fourofficer police force with private policing firm Contracting out for policing is a common practice in Switzerland and the Bahamas Calls on Congress to once again investigate the FBI miss the mark concludes Benson Changing the political and bureaucratic delivery of policing services requires fundamental reform and the growth of the private security industry strongly suggests how those reforms

schooling according to Alex Tabarrok research director at The Independent Institute In his testimony before the State of Californias Little Hoover Commission Tabarrok argued that private schooling is the most effective way to foster proficiency in the English language the single most important skill for immigrants to learn Californias public high schools Tabarrok noted have appalling student dropout rates percent overall and about percent for immigrants Dropout rates for similar students are much lower in private schools Californias public schools also have little room for educational diversity experimentation or competition In the heated debate over bilingual education no one questioned why politicians bureaucrats and voters should decide a question best left to parents and educators Private education is much better at matching students with teaching styles and curricula best suited to their individual needs Private schools are a benefit to native students as well as immigrants Lower dropout rates and greater college attendance for natives reduces potential conflicts in the labor market between lowskilled natives and immigrants Tabarrok also called for repealing laws and regulations that impede entrepreneurship among immigrants such as city regulations that have eroded jitney services often run by immigrants and other economic outsiders Tabarrok also noted that immigrant integration is not always desirable Immigrants for example often have stronger families high rates of entrepreneurship and lower crime rates than do natives especially for their education and income levels If natives had the same institutionalization rate as immigrants Tabarrok said our jails and prisons would have onethird fewer inmates For Alex Tabarroks Testimony on

to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery Forbid it Almighty God I know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death Patrick Henry b d Memorial Day may get more fanfare but for lovers of liberty Patrick Henrys birthday is even more significant While there is no denying the need for a day of remembrance for the Americans who have died in battle what made their sacrifices meaningful is the principle behind the American Ideal the principle articulated most passionately in Patrick Henrys immortal words give me liberty or give me death Ironic though it may at first seem Henrys fighting words are the words of a peacemaker For the only lasting peace is one that arises from an embrace of the principle of liberty peace and liberty are two sides of the coin of a voluntary society And the sooner that the United States and other governments learn this the less likely that they will add to the list of those we remember on Memorial Day Patrick Henry also reminds us that liberty is not secured overnight A decade after the American Revolution Henry fought hard to secure the Bill of Rights he recognized that an unlimited federal government could be just as tyrannical as the British monarchy Patrick Henry should thus be remembered for both his principles and his realism A heart and mind united Henry was a patriot to whom Americans will always

Californians Need More Electricity Deregulation Not Less Urban Riots and Small Business PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ASSAILS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM The discovery that a Texasbased crime lab technician fabricated phony evidence used by criminal prosecutors to convict innocent people only adds to an already strong case against the American criminal justice system according to Independent Institute Research Fellow Paul Craig Roberts The criminal justice system has lost the ability to screen out unbalanced people who use their offices not to serve justice but to serve bureaucrati c success indicators such as conviction rates propagandistic causes and tort lawyers If truth be known some of the worst criminals in the country are ensconced in the offices of the criminal justice system The

Police Department had framed hundreds of people sent to prison These injustices committed by people whom society trusts to determine gui lt and innocence are not aberrations If the premier crime lab

huge jump in electricity rates in parts of California last summer cause d many to believe that the states deregulation of the electric power industr y was a mistake In response the states Independent System Operator ISO the quasigovernment agency that manages electricity transmission imposed shortterm price ceilings on wholesale electricity rates its renewal of th e price caps last month extending indefinitely appears to be the beginning of electricity reregulation However the ISOs price caps ensure that Californians will face future problems writes Scott Esposito public affairs intern at The Independent Institute in a new oped The ISOs price caps are a case of a remedy that is far worse than the disease writes Esposito By capping the price that generators may sell their electricity at per megawatt hour the ISOs proposal would ma ke California a market that no sane generator would enter Why sell electricit y in California for at most per megawatt hour when you can sell it in New York for up to per megawatt hour Californians would be better served by abolishing the ISO and opening electricity transmission to the free market thereby encouraging the development of new transmission capacity Esposito argues Massive rate hikes leading to August electricity bills in San Diego and extensive blackouts in San Francisco have made utility deregulation lo ok like a mistake However the

academics and celebrities explained away the mob violence by dwelling on the rioters context But the injustices suffered by the mobs victims were completely ignored and some innercity neighborhoods never recovered as evidenced by the hackneyed image of politicians visiting blighted inner cities and promising if elected to do for it what his opponent cannot If political operatives in the current

Environmental Propaganda Agency William Lloyd Garrison Antislavery Crusader PENTAGON SHOCKED TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK Captain Louis Renault Claude Rainess cheerfully duplicitous character in the film classic Casablanca asserted glibly that he was shocked shocked to learn that gambling was taking place at Ricks Cafe Moments later he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night All this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in military construction The investigation concluded that three senior Army Corps of Engineers officials had just as one whistleblowing Corps economist had claimed engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington Post called a billiondollar construction binge on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers The Pentagon investigators concluded that the agencys aggressive efforts to expand its budget and missions as well as its eagerness to please its corporate customers and congressional patrons have helped create an atmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy the Post reports Even the agencys retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were often corrupt and that several Corps employees cited immense pressure to greenlight questionable projects Bureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy But they are hardly news Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five Year Plans only to implement new equally flawed versions so it seems that every few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own centrally planned fiefdom only to present a new Plan that operates under the same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance With corruption and waste seemingly taken care of the worst porkbarrel spenders in

score points with statist environmental activists Except on a few controversial issues a strong case can be made that the fortythird President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a close friend of the environment President George W Bush for example would face strong pressure to show that he is bipartisan in his approach to environmental protection whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to win back those who supported Nader and the Greens All the more reason then to call attention to the failures of the current approach to environmental protection especially those emanating from the US Environmental Protection Agency or as economist Craig Marxsen terms it the Environmental Propaganda Agency The EPA sometimes employs the language of costbenefit analysis to illustrate its seemingly tremendous success but it is known to employ it in a highly misleading manner The EPA claimed for example that its Clean Air Act programs produced from to trillion dollars in health benefits at a cost of only billion But reports Marxsen in THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW The EPAs study actually represents a milestone in bureaucratic propaganda Like junk science in the courtroom the study seemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than to come as close as possible to the truth In conclusion writes Marxsen Without the illusory benefit of all the lives saved the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably could have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice The Clean Air Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air pollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the most sensitive person in the population The EPA relentlessly presses forward in its absurd quest like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane determination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it For more information see The Environmental Propaganda Agency by Craig S Marxsen THE

moderation I will not equivocate I will not excuse I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard William Lloyd Garrison THE LIBERATOR January December marks the th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd Garrison a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement As the late historian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book AwardFinalist biography ALL ON FIRE William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery William Lloyd Garrison is an authentic American hero who with a Biblical prophets power and a propagandists skill forced the nation to confront the most crucial moral issue in its history For thirtyfive years he edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston THE LIBERATOR which remains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the service of civic idealism Although Garrison a selfmade man with a scanty formal education considered himself a New England mechanic and lived outside the precincts of the American intelligentsia he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work of challenging orthodoxy questioning public policy and offering a luminous vision of a society transformed He inspired two generations of activists female and male black and white and together they built a social movement which like the civil rights movement of our own day was a collaboration of ordinary people stirred by injustice and committed to each other who achieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong and then ridiculed as impossible Indeed without Garrisons inflammatory but compelling writing speaking and organizing there might have been no effective American antislavery movement at all For more on William Lloyd Garrison read historian Henry Mayers talk from the Independent Policy Forum The Civil War
