Shanescom DATE Tue Nov RE My Friend Forwarded by Jack PlanzRPGINC on AM I walked into the grocery store not particularly interested in buying groceries I wasnt hungry The pain of losing my husband of years was still too raw And this grocery store held so many sweet memories Rudy often came with me and almost every time hed pretend to go off and look for something special I knew what he was up to Id always spot him walking down the aisle with the three yellow roses in his hands Rudy knew I loved yellow roses With a heart filled with grief I only wanted to buy my few items and leave but even grocery shopping was different since Rudy had passed on Shopping for one took time a little more thought than it had for two Standing by the meat I searched for the perfect small steak and remembered how Rudy had loved his steak Suddenly a woman came beside me She was blond slim and lovely in a soft green pantsuit I watched as she picked up a large pack of Tbones dropped them in her basket hesitated and then put them back She turned to go and once again reached for the pack of steaks She saw me watching her and she smiled My husband loves Tbones but honestly at these prices I dont know I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her pale blue eyes My husband passed away eight days ago I told her Glancing at the package in her hands I fought to control the tremble in my voice Buy him the steaks And cherish every moment you have together She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed the package in her basket and wheeled away I turned and pushed my cart across the length of the store to the dairy products There I stood trying to decide which size milk I should buy A quart I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near the front of the store If nothing else I could always fix myself an ice cream cone I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down the aisle toward the front I saw first the green suit then recognized the pretty lady coming towards me In her arms she carried a package On her face was the brightest smile I had ever seen I would swear a soft halo encircled her blond hair as she kept walking toward me her eyes holding mine As she came closer I saw what she held and tears began misting in my eyes These are for you she said and placed three beautiful long stemmed yellow roses in my arms When you go through the line they will know these are paid for She leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on my cheek then smiled again I wanted to tell her what shed done what the roses meant but still unable to speak I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my vision I looked down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green tissue wrapping and found it almost unreal How did she know Suddenly the answer seemed so clear I wasnt alone Oh Rudy you havent forgotten me have you I whispered with tears in my eyes He was still with me and she was his angel Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you are
