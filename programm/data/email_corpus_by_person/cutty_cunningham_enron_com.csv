you think Pipeline safety act reauthorization F issues after the Senate markup On June the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation unanimously reported S Senator McCainFs bill to amend the Pipeline Safety Act Much of this bill is acceptable and would represent a reasonable and even welcome resolution of issues raised since the petroleum products pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington in June Unfortunately however the treatments accorded five specific issues by the bill are so objectionable that unless changes in these areas can be made passage of the bill must be opposed This said there is good reason to believe that an aggressive effort can be successful in correcting the treatment of these issues by opposing passage of the bill until changes are made The bill and committee report are expected to be filed in the Senate after the July th recess At that time we need to have in place commitments fro m several Senators to withhold consent for consideration of the bill until specific changes are made If the negotiations that could be expected to follow communication of these holds to SenGorton Sen McCain and the Majority Leaders yield an acceptable amended bill we would push hard for passage and enactment of that bill The changes that must be made to the bill in order to support passage are Mandatory reassignment of personnel under section b an operator mus t reassign any employee whose performance of duties affecting safety is under an accident investigation by DOT of the NTSB Failure to comply leads to shutdown of the pipeline There is no discretion The scope of coverage i s determined by investigators and the length of reassignment is the length o f the investigation This provision could force the reassignment after even a small accident of a large number of pipeline employees including management for an indefinite period of time threatening the safe operatio n of the line Counter Must be deleted or substantially modified

advisory councils that would advise the Secretary on a broad range of pipeline safety issues proposals for new pipeline facilities pipeline permitting and standards and other pipelinerelated matters These advisor y councils would be federally funded of unlimited duration and would not be subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act eg balance in composition chair by a federal official restrictions on conflict of interest In effect these councils provide a federallysanctioned platform and financial vehicle to support opposition t o pipelines on a local state and also potentially on a national basis Counter Must be deleted in the present form We would aggressively seek to prevent enactment of the entire bill rather than accept a federal program to subsidize a platform for opposition to pipelines and pipeline projects As an alternative the charter of the existing federal advisory committees one for liquids and one for gas should be expanded to encourag e attention to local concerns Reiterate that federal advisory committees must comply with FACA Reemphasize the industryFs commitment to public right to know but opposition to a proliferation of regulatory or quasiregulatory authorities to which pipelines must respond Review of Operator Pipeline Integrity Programs Section of the bill requires each pipeline operator to solicit and respond to the views of stat e and local officials during development of pipeline integrity plans In addition States with interstate agent status may review these plans at any time and the Secretary must seriously consider the stateFs recommendati ons Counter Must be substantially modified As drafted this is an essentially regulatory provision requiring negotiation between the operator and an
