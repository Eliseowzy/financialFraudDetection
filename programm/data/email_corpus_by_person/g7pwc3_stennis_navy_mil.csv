unfortunately I didnt We just spent a long weeks at sea that was not easy It is more the boredom of routine that slows the time down The team was getting a bit touchy with each other and everyone needed a break We pulled into Bahrain in the Persian Gulf and it was a good time to recharge We all survived the break and are now back out in the Persian Gulf We will in the Persian Gulf until the end of May The ships aircraft fly everyday over Southern Iraq enforcing Operation Southern Watch the NoFly zone The aircraft have been engaged by surfacetoair missiles and antiaircraft artillery The aircraft then bomb them into oblivion with laser guided bombs I have seen the footage and it is pretty devastating Still the Iraqs light up their gun radars though The Cruiser and Destroyers of the Battle Group are on a different mission which is the Maritime Intercept Operation of the UN This is the enforcement of oil embargoes on Iran and Iraq for UN sanctions The ships stop the freighters or tankers and then send in Navy Seals or Marines to search the ship I have seen the footage of this and it is unbelievable the instant coordination that goes on Below is my adventure in Bahrain and some pictures to go with them See you all in the summer After long weeks out to sea the Stennis finally weighed anchor at the port of Bahrain The whole team was very relieved to have a day off after days straight of working hour days Day They called the liberty call at AM which is earlier then they have ever called it I was caught in the shower so I had to rush to finish up My bags had been packed for days so I was able to catch up with the rest of the team in the Hanger Bay They have a new system called a Smart Card system that logs everyone in and out of the ship This always causes a minute delay After this though there are always plenty of boats to take us pier side We hopped on one and rode the miles into the dock area It was a heavily industrious harbor and the water though warm looked a bit polluted Tons of jellyfish were also seen throughout the water We then walked about a halfmile down the pier and into the American Naval Base that was there The gates and barricades to this place were heavier then the White House and more heavily defended For most of the ship they were not granted overnight liberty and so the base would the focus of there relaxation There were bars setup and all sorts of activities planned We caught a cab to our hotel the Le Meridien that was the nicest in Bahrain and had its own private beach The hotel was like an oasis in the desert because it was outside the main city of Manama and surrounded by scrub desert At the gate of the hotel an armed guard with a machine gun searched the trunk of the cab Inside the hotel there were all Saudis It was the end of the Hajj their most religious time of the year and they all come to Bahrain to drink smoke and do other sins against Allah The whole ship was told explicitly to stay out of their way by the XO of the ship Our rooms werent ready so we dumped our bags and went out to the pool caf for some lunch Lunch was a huge buffet spread that had shwarmas Persian rice and all sorts of good Mid East food We ate and drank for a couple of hours I then got my room and changed to go to the beach The beach was manmade and enclosed by a lagoon where I sat in the sun the rest of the afternoon At PM some of us met to go get some drinks before dinner We walked to the Trader Vics next to the hotel and found it open but empty They apparently dont believe in happy hour We had some drinks and ate there At PM we left there to go meet up with some people from the ship at an Irish Pub They had Guinness on tap so I was happy We followed most of the pilots from the Stennis to the Warbler that had a band that rocked until AM We then returned exhausted to the hotel and after making some embarrassing late night calls which of course is daytime in the States to friends I went to sleep Day The second day started much later as I was sleeping spread eagle on my king sized bed and didnt want to leave itever I stumbled to the beach with a headache and sat on the beach for the entire afternoon The weeks at sea had apparently wiped out my tolerance I walked around the lagoon and took it easy Since I realized that most restaurant did not start the food service until PM I decided to eat a late lunch at PM which consisted of the same incredible buffet as the day before We all met up in the club level of the hotel around PM for drinks before we decided to eat I was not feeling to great but decided to join some of the people who were going to the Italian restaurant that was located inside the hotel This was an exceptional place where the food was very good The Veal Milanese rivaled the best I have had in the States I felt much better after that and was willing to join the rest of the group going out to a nightclub The nightclub turned out to be pretty dead and at AM we called it a night Day I woke up around PM and again had to fight to get out of bed I had set my AC to very cold and was buried under many soft blankets I met up with a few people and ate lunch at the caf on the beach We then walked over to the lagoon and sat on the beach over there for the rest of the afternoon The best thing about it was that there was a golfcart that drove around with drinks and snacks for everyone I read my book and dozed most of the afternoon The sun was never particular strong the whole time we were there which I think was do to the amount of dust from the Saudi desert miles across the Persian Gulf It reduces visibility across the entire Gulf and into Iran of us decided to do the tourist thing in Bahrain later in the afternoon The only thing we were told to go see was this new mall that was built To me it was just like seeing any other mall except it was a little smaller then US malls I didnt buy anything but it was interesting to look at prices that were about double US standards You can haggle for any price including a pair of socks but you couldnt get them to US prices Everything on Bahrain is imported because it is an island Upon returning to the hotel around PM we met up with a group that was going to the Lebanese restaurant inside the hotel This was also rated the best in Bahrain It was quite a feast with main courses spread from PM until AM with bellydancers and singers entertaining everyone It was in a huge tent with beautiful Persian carpets everywhere I never ate so much and had a great time I literally rolled into bed Day Our last day since we had to get back on the ship tonight Liberty expired at AM in the morning and it too much of a hassle to try and go in the AM I woke up and spent most of the day doing PwC paperwork by dialing in There were hundreds of junk emails to toss out and maybe real messages over weeks of no connection I had the usual time and expense Nazis screaming at me to sign timesheets After months and multiple explanations they still dont get that I have no connectivity I cant wait to see that appear on my GCF I got most of what I needed done I then needed to get my watch fixed and set out to find an Omega dealer in Bahrain After following at least peoples directions to places they swore were there I gave up and would wait until Dubai Dubai is a larger city and has multiple Omega dealers For our final meal we decided to again stay at the hotel There was an excellent Indian restaurant in the hotel I couldnt tell you the Indian name for the food I ordered but it was curry chicken and a basmati ricelamb combination Again I ate way too much and had to roll out of there We packed up and headed to ship around PM All in all it was great to get away from the ship for a couple of days after the week binge Bahrain doesnt have much to it and is basically supported by all the Saudis who drive across every weekend to party The American base is tiny there I am glad the next stops in the Persian Gulf will be Dubai I was also told that Dubai has better values on gold and rugs From now on all of our atseaperiods will be around two weeks Thank God Trader Vicsjpg Meridien Pooljpg Meridien Frontjpg Bahrain across Bayjpg Indian

built To me it was just like seeing any other mall except it was a little smaller then US malls I didnt buy anything but it was interesting to look at prices that were about double US standards You can haggle for any price including a pair of socks but you couldnt get them to US prices Everything on Bahrain is imported because it is an island Upon returning to the hotel around PM we met up with a group that was going to the Lebanese restaurant inside the hotel This was also rated the best in Bahrain It was quite a feast with main courses spread from PM until AM with bellydancers and singers entertaining everyone It was in a huge tent with beautiful Persian carpets everywhere I never ate so much and had a great time I literally rolled into bed Day Our last day since we had to get back on the ship tonight Liberty expired at AM in the morning and it too much of a hassle to try and go in the AM I woke up and spent most of the day doing PwC paperwork by dialing in There were hundreds of junk emails to toss out and maybe real messages over weeks of no connection I had the usual time and expense Nazis screaming at me to sign timesheets After months and multiple explanations they still dont get that I have no connectivity I cant wait to see that appear on my GCF I got most of what I needed done I then needed to get my watch fixed and set out to find an Omega dealer in Bahrain After following at least peoples directions to places they swore were there I gave up and would wait until Dubai Dubai is a larger city and has multiple Omega dealers For our final meal we decided to again stay at the hotel There was an excellent Indian restaurant in the hotel I couldnt tell you the Indian name for the food I ordered but it was curry chicken and a basmati ricelamb combination Again I ate way too much and had to roll out of there We packed up and headed to ship around PM All in all it was great to get away from the ship for a couple of days after the week binge Bahrain doesnt have much to it and is basically supported by all the Saudis who drive across every weekend to party The American base is tiny there I am glad the next stops in the Persian Gulf will be Dubai I was also told that Dubai has better values on gold and rugs From now on all of our atseaperiods will be around two weeks Thank God Trader Vicsjpg Meridien Pooljpg Meridien Frontjpg Bahrain across Bayjpg Indian
