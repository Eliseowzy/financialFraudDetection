Hirstcom From Eric Hirst Hirstcom Subject New Report on Lessons from California MimeVersion ContentType multipartalternative boundaryALT Dear Colleague The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper The California Electricity Crisis Lessons for Other States which I wrote The paper is available on the Publications page of my website wwwEHirstcom File Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper Here is a summary of the paper California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future That future as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants Although the first two years of restructuring beginning in April seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disaster for Californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilities Part of the fallout from Californias electricity crisis is considerable concerneven oppositionin other states to restructuring the electricity industry Although a few states have decided based on the California experience not to restructure I believe that is the wrong outcome Instead the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work competition is not to blame for Californias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand and prices affect market outcomes Section of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May Section the heart of this paper offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry This section makes several points Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads Ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loads maintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support large regional markets and provide fuel to power plants Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamicpricing and voluntaryloadreduction programs ie couple retail and wholesale markets Create honest retail competition avoid standardoffer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ancillary services and transmission congestion Monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation and vertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission Ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improve reliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options But this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern hightech society electricity is our most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment Also electricity truly is a realtime product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the longterm benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible shortterm problems that may occur They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state Finally competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and pricerisk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers Eric Eric Hirst Consulting in ElectricIndustry Restructuring Capital Circle Oak Ridge TN phone fax Hirstcom File

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Wednesday By Bryan Lee OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow JonesFederal energy regulators said Wednesday they are reconsidering the role of forprofit transmission companies in regional transmission organizations as part of changes eyed to address concerns of unregulated public utilities and state utility regulators In a freewheeling discussion of pending cases involving consolidation of powergrid assets under large RTOs in the Northeast Southeast and Midwest the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it would rethink how much RTO authority it would allow forprofit transmission companies or transcos The revelation came as FERC discussed concerns publicly owned utilities have regarding joining an RTO with a forprofit transco as the primary organizing feature Similar concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators who like public utilities prefer a nonprofit independent system administrator to govern RTO operations The apparent policy retrenchment met with immediate concern both within FERC and without Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt warned that it would be interpreted as the death knell rung for independent standalone transmission companies Former FERC Chairman Elizabeth Moler who now heads the Washington office of Exelon Corp EXC was only slightly less pessimistic I think transcos are on life support said Moler whose company is involved in the Alliance Regional Transmission Organization the most developed transco proposal before FERC Wednesdays FERC discussion marked a potentially significant reversal of former FERC Chairman Curt Heberts key accomplishment at the commission advancing transcos as a viable business model for RTOs To raise capital you have to go to Wall Street and they must have the confidence to invest in those RTO structures Everyone agrees nonprofit systems wont get the capital to build out the grid of tomorrow Hebert said After leaving FERC in August Hebert now heads governmental affairs for Entergy Corp ETR another utility company pursuing spinning off its transmission assets to a forprofit transco At a fundamental level the commission is going back to the drawing board on a key nonprofit versus forprofit debate FERC resolved in its original rules calling for establishment of RTOs FERC Chairman Pat Wood III voiced concern about the rules provisions allowing forprofit transcos to have responsibility for all core functions of an RTO Given the profitdriven agenda of a transco its governing boards decisions may not be coincident with the publicinterest goals of FERC in establishing RTOs Wood said Transcos have some things that scare people off Wood said FERC in its rush to get the transco model out there may not have thought through all that Balancing the interests of those who advocate forprofit and nonprofit approaches to RTO development was a key theme of FERCs discussion Wednesday For several hours the four sitting commissioners probed the results of two orders FERC issued in July directing talks toward establishing single RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast FERC also discussed grid consolidation in the Midwest The nonprofitversusprofit debate contributed to a schism that ultimately resulted in two competing RTO proposals in the Midwest While FERC hasnt acted yet it is contemplating an order that may upset a previously approved settlement allowing the two Midwest entities to remain separate while operating under a single transmissionaccess tariff and rates In the Southeast municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are balking in the face of FERCs directive to form a single RTO based on a forprofit model called GridSouth which has received FERCs approval contingent upon becoming a largersized entity The public utilities and state regulators lean toward a competing RTO proposal advanced by the Southern Co SO which is framed around an independent system administrator rather than a transco Bobbie McCartney the FERC administrative law judge who oversaw the consolidation talks urged FERC to act to break the impasse Now would be an optimum time to look to the commission for guidance she said Addressing the concerns of public power companies is a critical element in the Southeast said Herb Tate the former New Jersey utility regulator hired by FERC as a consultant during the consolidation talks The FERC regulators appeared to be wrestling with how best to craft a hybrid RTO incorporating both nonprofit and forprofit elements They mulled whether the nonprofit model should be dominant while accounting for transcos or whether the transco should be dominant while incorporating features of the nonprofit model Commissioner William Massey who lost the debate in favor of the nonprofit model when FERC first framed its RTO rules called developing a satisfactory hybrid a very important issue as the commission seeks to implement RTOs FERC must divide up or apportion the RTO functions along nonprofit and forprofit lines Massey said We need to make that cut agreed Wood rejecting Breathitts suggestion that withdrawing key RTO functions could mark the end of independent transmission companies Splitting core RTO responsibilities between forprofit and nonprofit entities will leave transcos a very viable business plan Wood said It may not be in the public interest to leave to a profitdriven entity issues such as managing powergrid congestion and reliability calculating available transmission capacity and interconnecting new power plants Wood said Some duties should be dealt with in a more public way Wood said Leaving some of these things under a single entity may not be best for wholesale power markets Wood said But Exelons Moler protested Woods assertions The RTO duties Wood called for withdrawing from transcos are fundamental to having a functional economically viable business she said Its clear based upon the discussion today that the commission is reconsidering whether transcos can be RTOs Moler said At a press conference following Wednesdays FERC meeting Wood agreed that a fully independent transco could have responsibility for all RTO functions But he said Were not really to that world yet The commission could take up the issues again at its next meeting Nov By then the commission directed FERC staff to provide further analysis of the profitversusnonprofit issues and to reassess the active and passive ownership limits for transcos in FERCs original RTO mandate

The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Enron has ample access to cash the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enrons stock plunged on Monday the chief executive Kenneth W Lay strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S Fastow the chief financial officer In addition Mr Fastow while declaring that Enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations declined to answer any questions about it The conference call which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors Within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to But it soon began falling and ended the day down cents at The days low of was the lowest since Jan and was down percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of Until recently most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalancesheet financing One involving partnerships controlled by Mr Fastow led to a billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to SEC inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday One of the companys strongest supporters has been David Fleischer an analyst at Goldman Sachs But he told Mr Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information There is an appearance that you are hiding something he said After the call Mr Fleischer expressed disappointment Theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand he said in an interview They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed he said But he said he was still recommending the stock I dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans he said In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr Fastow But he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy Mr Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called Marlin That company owns onethird of Azurix an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex a British water utility The auditors have determined there is no writedown required he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management a money management firm Mr Grubman said that Marlin owed almost billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake Noting that Enron had paid about million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in Azurix Mr Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares Mr Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details Eventually he cut off Mr Grubman I know youre trying to drive the stock price down and youve done a pretty good job of it Mr Lay said But lets move on to the next question Mr Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had billion in such debt outstanding He said it was backed by billion in bank lines of credit of which billion will expire next May if it is not renewed Mr Lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement The SEC is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin Mr Lay said the company will look into providing such statements

Fort Worth Star Telegram Publication date Arrival time Electricity generators around the country didnt need to read the Bush administrations energy plan to know theres already a strong market for their product Its a bit of frenzy I would say Lane Kadel said of demand for the natural gasfired turbines brokered by his company Utility Warehousecom of Portland Ore The yearold enterprise originally started to help electric utilities buy and sell surplus equipment has seen demand for electricitygenerating machinery move into high voltage territory in recent months With electricity already in short supply in parts of the country headlines of rolling blackouts in California and growth projected to require more power US electricity generators have announced plans for megawatts of new capacity Thats equal to about percent of the nations existing generating capacity So it was no surprise to anybody in the industry that electricity figured prominently Thursday in President Bushs energy plan The plan largely emphasizes the need to add more energy supplies projecting that the nation will need to add megawatts of capacity by In the nation added megawatts of new capacity according to the Energy Department Bushs plan also aims to speed up additions to generating capacity by easing licensing permitting and other regulatory review including rules to encourage more nuclear power plants The Bush plan industry people say apparently contains nothing to discourage the industrys push to add supply If there is we havent seen it said Mark Stultz vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association a group of independent power producers The plans for new capacity that have already been announced represent more than billion in potential investment in new electricity supply Not all the planned capacity will be built at least not right away said Tom Rose vice president of public affairs at TXU in Dallas But a lot will and the projects that are postponed will probably still go through permitting and land acquisition things that dont cost a lot of money Rose said With that groundwork done new capacity could come on line all the faster when the market justifies it he said The emphasis on adding supply doesnt please everyone in the electricity business Jerry Davia president of Orion Energy in Sausalito Calif would rather see the government encourage investment in energy efficiency Davias company consults with companies including San Antoniobased HE Butt Grocery Co to design and finance energysaving systems Theres tons of new energyefficient technology out there all the time he said Theres enough conservation to tackle any problems we have Energy users are probably in the best position to decide which energy efficiencies make sense financially but the government could make the economics more attractive with tax credits and other incentives he said I dont see anything that bodes well in the Bush plan as far as subsidies and credits he said And theres nothing just for California Thats fine with Karl Rabago managing director of the Rocky Mountain Institute a notforprofit organization that advocates efficient use of resources including energy Rabago said he doesnt want energy use subsidized because that shortcircuits the market mechanism that forces users to reduce consumption in response to higher prices At the same time he also doesnt like aspects of the Bush plan that he believes subsidize energy production Jesper Michaelsen sales manager for wind turbine manufacturer NEG Micon USA of Rolling Hills Ill said he was disappointed that Bushs plan doesnt set any specific goals for increasing the amount of power generated from renewable sources Wind and solar sources account for just percent of the nations total electricity market But Allen Barnett who heads solar panel maker AstroPower of Newark Del said hes thankful for any attention at all given the oilandgas backgrounds of many Bush advisers The Bush plan does include tax credits for people who purchase solar panels Its the most we could hope for Barnett said I didnt expect them to abandon their roots The Bush electricity measures that dont deal with adding generating capacity address ways to build a bigger transmission system to carry power from generators to users Two major recommendations include the creation of a national electricity grid and giving federal regulators power to condemn private property for infrastructure improvements such as new electrical transmission lines and natural gas pipelines to deliver fuel to new generators Today the United States has three regional electricity transmission grids Western Eastern and Texas which is mostly on its own grid and unlike energystrapped states such as California has a surplus of electricity Texas is virtually unconnected to the two regional grids and the two regional grids likewise arent efficiently linked Its going to lead to a lot of new investment utility analyst Barry Abramson of the UBS Warburg investment firm said of Bushs proposals Right now the country is full of transmission bottlenecks that make the system less efficient and hinder competition and the delivery of power The Texas Legislature commissioned a study into tying Texas into the national grids and concluded that it would cost million to million TXUs Rose said It is not easy he said It all has to be done at the same time because the amount of electricity moving between grids would quickly overload one or two connecting lines Rose also said many states including Texas already allow governments to condemn private property a process called eminent domain Public transportation projects provide the most common use of eminent domain along with the construction of pipelines Kadel said boosting the nations electricity infrastructure might be just as important as adding generating capacity Right now you dont have any way to move the electricity so prices are high he said

STANDARDS May Utility Environment Report Page Copyright McGrawHill Inc Massachusetts became the first state to issue limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with the recent release of a major new plan that requires older plants to meet tougher standards for several pollutants The new regulations which take effect in June call for the states six oldest power plants which total MW to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by sulfur dioxide by as much as and CO by Power plants also must begin stack testing for mercury in preparation for mercury emissions standards that will begin Oct Issued by the state Dept of Environmental Protection the regulations apply to Sithe Energies Mystic Station in Everett NRG Energys Montaup Station in Somerset PGE National Energy Groups Salem Harbor in Salem and Brayton Point in Somerset Northeast Utilities Mount Tom Station and Mirants Canal Electric in Sandwich Although Massachusetts has emissions trading and averaging rules the new regulations prohibit use of emissions averaging between the plants to meet the standards Local citizens environmental groups and elected officials protested such averaging because they feared that PGE National Energy Group would use reductions from its Salem Mass plant to offset emissions at its Fall River Brayton Point facility creating what they described as a burden of air pollution in Fall River The rules do however allow plants to generate SO early reduction credits by operating below historical average emission rates A generating facility can use the ERCs to meet the new standards but cannot transfer the ERCs to another facility The DEP also will allow transfer of SO allowances under the Federal Acid Rain program The DEP noted that the plants will be emitting at rates lower than what the EPA requires to create allowances Therefore the plants are likely to create a substantial number of unused allowances If the plants transfer the allowances to upwind sources it could harm air quality in Massachusetts The DEP plans to monitor the situation and may limit the ability of the plants to accumulate the allowances if they are having an adverse impact on Massachusetts The rules allow use of offsite reductions and carbon sequestration to comply with the CO cap In the future it also plans to allow CO trading and will set up a Massachusetts Greenhouse Gas Reductions Registry to promote reductions and create consistency in their creation The DEP decided against issuing a standard for fine particulate matter for the time being saying there is currently insufficient technical information to support a standard and that the NOx and SO reductions will automatically reduce PM concentrations While the regulations won praise from several environmental groups the Competitive Power Coalition of New England warned that they may jeopardize reliability increase consumer costs and reduce fuel diversity CPC says that the state went back on its original proposal announced about a year ago which was supported by the plant owners Plant owners offered voluntary emissions reductions with the understanding that if they did the state would not institute new regulations The DEP however said that not all of the power plant owners submitted detailed voluntary plans And further the state agency said that it had made clear that it would incorporate the voluntary proposals in new regulations CPC said that the original proposals also did not include CO or mercury limits and did not prohibit averaging Moreover the state originally agreed to give plant owners several more years to comply setting deadlines of and to meet reductions according to Neal Costello CPC general counsel Instead the final rules call for the plants to achieve the standards between Oct and Oct Plants that repower are given more time than those that install emissions pollution control technologies Specifically plants that repower have until Oct to reduce NOx by lbsMWh using a month rolling average and SO to lbsMWh By they must reduce SO to lbsMWh Plants that do not repower have until Oct to meet the first SO and NOx standards and until Oct to meet the final SO standard For CO plants must limit emissions to lbsMWh by Oct if they install emissions reductions devices and two years later if they repower The DEP said it is giving plants more time if they repower because it will take them longer to complete design permitting and construction Its worth the wait the DEP said because repowering reduces multiple pollutants CPCs Costello said that the regulations will increase power costs at about the same time that the state is scheduled to end discounted utility standard offer service which is taken by about of the states electricity consumers The customers will then buy power at market

Fort Worth StarTelegram Texas FINAL Page Copyright AUSTIN Electric deregulation comes to Texas today but Texans who signed up to switch to a new power company face at least a months delay because of technical problems government and utility officials said Thursday Computers at an organization overseeing the states electric grid still cannot process the tens of thousands of requests to transfer service from one electric company to another officials said Such service transfers are the backbone of the deregulation program under which electric companies compete for customers The state begins phasing in deregulation today with a pilot project allowing customers to pick their provider Full deregulation is scheduled to begin in January Deregulation has been branded a disaster in California but Texas officials say they are being careful not to make the same mistakes Regulators are calling for virtual switching that would allow billing from new providers to start in July about a month late even if the new computers still cannot handle the load officials said Both utility groups and consumer advocates are critical of virtual switching Carol Biedrzycki a consumer advocate who helps oversee the deregulation test project said Id say we have serious problems I didnt think there would be as many technical problems as were having Im not saying theyre doing a bad job but its just much more complicated than anybody thought it would be The states deregulation law opens Texas to full retail competition among electric utilities next year But a less ambitious test project kicks off today in which companies can compete for up to percent of the market and the grid operator can test its new computer systems As part of that kickoff today the grid operator will christen its squarefoot million control center in Austin It also plans to open an squarefoot million facility next year Tom Noel executive director of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas or Ercot which operates the grid expressed optimism Thursday and played down any reported delays in the pilot project He said the council can now manage about switches a day but should be able to process about each day next month But there are aspects of the pilot that will occur later than we thought said Noel We have gone through various mock market drills and in my opinion the system does not work well enough yet to proceed Were going through it in a very deliberate way he said The challenge of managing so many switches over residential customers have requested a change under the pilot has also earned Texas a spot on a monitoring list for summertime electric problems According to a report last month by the North American Electric Reliability Council an industry organization of power grid operators the reliability councils conversion could lead to operational difficulties this summer But Noel played down the potential for difficulties and said the system should be fully operational in time for full competition in January We realize that we need to go through this at a walking pace he said Well do a small number of switches for each of the competitive retailers just to be sure that our system is working as it should The Electric Reliability Council of Texas utilities and the state Public Utility Commission have also begun discussing the implementation of the socalled virtual switch process which would bypass the fully automated system now being used say utility and regulatory officials The proposal has drawn criticism from both utility groups and consumer advocates who say it does nothing to prepare Texas for deregulation because it does not test the system that would operate when the market fully opens next year But business groups and regulators at the PUCs request continue discussing how to implement the virtual switchover TXU spokesman Christopher K Schein characterized the proposal as a sort of trophy switch that allows officials to boast that they have been able to switch customers from one company to another even though the underlying computer systems remain untested Its a system thats difficult to manage and youre focusing companies to detour resources to create a shortterm fix he said Janee Briesemeister a senior policy analyst at Consumers Union said regulators would create a pretend market through virtual switching And thats just adding additional costs onto an already very very expensive operating system she said The pilot is called a pilot for a reason and thats because the purpose is to test the systems necessary to support the new market structure Although electric competitors can serve up to percent of the market under the pilot project beginning today far fewer customers have expressed interest in changing service In the TXU service area residential customers have signed up for a competitors service That represents about percent of the customers eligible for service under the pilot and about percent of all residential customers in the TXU service area

ProQuest Information and Learning All rights reserved Copyright Public Utilities Reports Incorporated Summer Online ease and access are an empty promise in a flawed market CLAMOR OVER THE recent market exit of Utilitycom billed as the worlds first Internet utility was a wakeup call for the energy industry That failure along with the energy debacle in California raises questions about the viability of the Internet as a vehicle for retail energy sales enrollments and fulfillment in particular and of electric and natural gas deregulation in general In the United States though nearly million customers percent of them residential are eligible to choose their electric andor gas supplier more than percent have remained with their incumbent utility distribution companies UDCs Of those who have switched just percent were residential customers and fewer than percent used the Internet for any part of the transaction Another million customers are expected to have choice by Jan Odds are however that switching will remain limited despite widespread access to the Internet and online signups that can make choice a simple matter of point and click The question is why The problem goes beyond the Internet to the very foundations of energy deregulation At the root its a question of customer value Independent power producers energy service providers ESPs and the utilities themselves sold energy restructuring on its promise of lower costs for consumers However the track record of other deregulated industries reveals that the reverse is often trueparticularly for mass market customers Making retail choice meaningful for customers depends on amending the ground rules of deregulation Though many needed initiatives lie in the hands of regulators it may be that the players that can be most influential in spurring action are the utilities and ESPs whose brands and fortunes are at stake during this transition WHY CUSTOMERS ARENT BITING As I see it five fundamental problems are hindering the successful transition to competitive retail energy markets Risky Business During regulation when energy prices were cost based and fixed UDCs generated supply to meet demand up to capacity Now many of the UDCs willingly have sold their generating assets and agreed to share the risk of price fluctuations The result is an outofcontrol wholesale market in which generators maximize profits by manipulating supply to drive up prices UDCs and ESPs forced to buy on the wholesale spot market get killed when their retail price is fixed by contract The result is that few ESPs are willing to risk taking title to wholesale energy for resale Furthermore the California Independent System Operator has evidence that the states energy crisis actually arose not from increased demand but from reduced supply The reason says the ISO is that generating facilities have cut capacity from last years levels for no apparent reason Amidst such speculation mass market customers are reluctant to switch from the safe haven of their incumbent utilities Wheres the Choice Industries such as airlines and telecom demonstrate that deregulation leads to price discrimination with different customers being offered different prices As a result ESPs compete hotly for large customers with large loads that allow them to be creative strategically and still be profitable On the other hand residential and small commercial customers present such thin margins especially with mandated pricetobeat offers and rate reductions from the utility that ESPs cannot serve them profitably without automated enrollment and customer selfservice processes Few ESPs have focused on automating these processes however During the regulated era utilities subsidized the cost of serving these small customers with the revenues earned from large accounts Now it seems no one wants them For example Enron completely abandoned the California residential market just three months after it opened In Pennsylvania ESPs are dumping residential customers back to their incumbent utilities ESPs in Ohio were forced to delay service to enrolled customers when their market support generation agreements with the incumbent utilities were not in place as expected All of this heightens fears among customers that their chosen ESP will not be able to serve them or will vacate the market Because they havent been educated to the contrary they fear they would be left without service or with some cost for switching to a new ESP or back to their utility Online Liquidity Lacking The muchtouted retail auction exchanges are also struggling One reason is that when customers compare bids in todays pricey market to last years contract prices they dont perceive any savings Second many commercial and industrial customers perceive no real price competition among retail suppliers for their contracts on an energy auction exchange They believe they will get more competitive bids by preparing requests for proposal and soliciting bids directly from suppliers Patchwork Regulation Because regulation varies by state and transactions vary by utility it is expensive and complex for ESPs to expand into different markets For example an ESP willing to offer a franchise deal to a national chain say McDonalds restaurants may find it virtually impossible to navigate the regulations and transactional requirements for working with the many utilities in all the states where the chain operates But Is That Rate Better A customer who visits a popular retail energy website such as Essentialcom or Energycom may be presented with a standard offer price from one ESP Is that a good price How does it compare to what he pays now Most massmarket energy customers dont know Add the fact that percent of all Internet shoppers do not complete their purchase transactions and the problem is clear Price discovery must be enhanced and the shopping and enrollment processes need to be simplified to attract novice energy buyers A TODO LIST FOR BUILDING REAL CHOICE The challenges I describe are formidable no one solution will address them all Here are some important actions necessary to help break the logjam Utilities and ESPs in particular can play a critical role in encouraging regulators at the state and federal levels to make needed changes Cap Wholesale Prices Energy companies are at the mercy of federal regulators to dampen wholesale market volatility They and state regulators should continue pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider shortterm regional price caps on wholesale electricity To mitigate gaming of the markets the FERC also should require generators to publish their annual plans for scheduled downtime and force them to explain unplanned downtime Form A MegaExchange To promote liquidity in retail energy exchanges the operators of the various exchanges should consider pooling their resources to develop a universal exchange portalor at least a virtual exchangethat most or all of the largest customers could use That way customers and suppliers could go to one site and see all deals even if the deals were posted regionally behind the scenes Such an exchange would offer various procurement vehicles including auction bidask and standard offer Suppliers also would welcome a single site where they could see all qualified deals Educate the Public Consumer education in deregulating markets clearly needs to go further Regulators in these states could follow a strategy thats been moderately successful in several states collecting money from all participating utilities and ESPs to launch a campaign to increase the publics understanding of retail choice Radio TV and print ads would explain the merits of deregulation demystifying the enrollment process and calming the fears of apprehensive customers Through this type of program for example Pennsylvania regulators saw mass market awareness of retail electric choice soar to percent in just over a year Utilities and ESPs can enhance these public awareness efforts by coordinating their own educational materials with the statewide campaign Redouble Marketing In line with the objectives to increase consumer awareness energy service providers need to do a better job of branding their service communicating their value proposition facilitating price discovery and targeting the actual buyer within commercial organizations This is a job for the professionals ESPs should hire and consult with Madison Avenue talent to develop branding and advertising campaigns ESP websites should allow a prospective customer to enter basic information from their utility bill and calculate both the commodity charge and the distribution charge demonstrating the clear impact of switching on one months bill Accuracy is critical Often the ESPs have difficulty getting this calculation right themselves Standardize Transactions Utilities and ESPs backed by a FERC directive should take the lead in developing national standards for electronic transactions including switching That would ease apprehension among customers make national contracting easier and reduce the investment required by energy suppliers to enter new markets Phase out Standard Offers State regulators should consider speeding the elimination of UDC price to beat and standard offers This price rigging creates a false economy with the customer adds undue price pressure to commodity prices and puts severe earnings pressure on utilities The crisis situation in California has made such potential consequences crystal dear Aggregate the Apathetic Some municipalities have begun aggregating their residents to form residential aggregation pools that are attractive to ESPs and wholesale suppliers If the municipality successfully addresses customer apprehension and allows disinterested customers to opt out these aggregations can be an effective way to force choice in a community at least until the next general election Energy companies and state regulators may be able to encourage aggregations by educating local officials on the benefits of such buying pools and providing materials for marketing to residents Force Choice State regulators can force all customers to choose an ESP andor bar the incumbent utility from acting as an ESP In Texas for example utilities cannot prospect for new energy supply customers outside their territory until at least percent of their franchise customers have chosen an alternative ESP For gas deregulation in Georgia all customers were assigned an ESP in proportion to the market share each ESP garnered in a pilot period Energy companies may influence legislators in deregulating states as well as federal legislators to pursue this approach Consider ReRegulation The FERC should consider guidelines to encourage states with volatile supply networks to reregulate or defer deregulation until the wholesale markets stabilize and the bugs have been ironed out of the deregulation process Simplify Rates State regulators should encourage utilities to simplify their rates for residential and small commercial customers That would allow retail suppliers and customers to more easily understand the rates and potential savings of switching to an ESP Deregulation will succeed only when all stakeholders put the success of the program before partisan interests Without the undivided support of all parties there can be little improvement on the pseudocompetitive mire we see today It just doesnt work Jeff Felton is a consultant based in

ProQuest Information and Learning All rights reserved Copyright Public Utilities Reports Incorporated Summer Online ease and access are an empty promise in a flawed market CLAMOR OVER THE recent market exit of Utilitycom billed as the worlds first Internet utility was a wakeup call for the energy industry That failure along with the energy debacle in California raises questions about the viability of the Internet as a vehicle for retail energy sales enrollments and fulfillment in particular and of electric and natural gas deregulation in general In the United States though nearly million customers percent of them residential are eligible to choose their electric andor gas supplier more than percent have remained with their incumbent utility distribution companies UDCs Of those who have switched just percent were residential customers and fewer than percent used the Internet for any part of the transaction Another million customers are expected to have choice by Jan Odds are however that switching will remain limited despite widespread access to the Internet and online signups that can make choice a simple matter of point and click The question is why The problem goes beyond the Internet to the very foundations of energy deregulation At the root its a question of customer value Independent power producers energy service providers ESPs and the utilities themselves sold energy restructuring on its promise of lower costs for consumers However the track record of other deregulated industries reveals that the reverse is often trueparticularly for mass market customers Making retail choice meaningful for customers depends on amending the ground rules of deregulation Though many needed initiatives lie in the hands of regulators it may be that the players that can be most influential in spurring action are the utilities and ESPs whose brands and fortunes are at stake during this transition WHY CUSTOMERS ARENT BITING As I see it five fundamental problems are hindering the successful transition to competitive retail energy markets Risky Business During regulation when energy prices were cost based and fixed UDCs generated supply to meet demand up to capacity Now many of the UDCs willingly have sold their generating assets and agreed to share the risk of price fluctuations The result is an outofcontrol wholesale market in which generators maximize profits by manipulating supply to drive up prices UDCs and ESPs forced to buy on the wholesale spot market get killed when their retail price is fixed by contract The result is that few ESPs are willing to risk taking title to wholesale energy for resale Furthermore the California Independent System Operator has evidence that the states energy crisis actually arose not from increased demand but from reduced supply The reason says the ISO is that generating facilities have cut capacity from last years levels for no apparent reason Amidst such speculation mass market customers are reluctant to switch from the safe haven of their incumbent utilities Wheres the Choice Industries such as airlines and telecom demonstrate that deregulation leads to price discrimination with different customers being offered different prices As a result ESPs compete hotly for large customers with large loads that allow them to be creative strategically and still be profitable On the other hand residential and small commercial customers present such thin margins especially with mandated pricetobeat offers and rate reductions from the utility that ESPs cannot serve them profitably without automated enrollment and customer selfservice processes Few ESPs have focused on automating these processes however During the regulated era utilities subsidized the cost of serving these small customers with the revenues earned from large accounts Now it seems no one wants them For example Enron completely abandoned the California residential market just three months after it opened In Pennsylvania ESPs are dumping residential customers back to their incumbent utilities ESPs in Ohio were forced to delay service to enrolled customers when their market support generation agreements with the incumbent utilities were not in place as expected All of this heightens fears among customers that their chosen ESP will not be able to serve them or will vacate the market Because they havent been educated to the contrary they fear they would be left without service or with some cost for switching to a new ESP or back to their utility Online Liquidity Lacking The muchtouted retail auction exchanges are also struggling One reason is that when customers compare bids in todays pricey market to last years contract prices they dont perceive any savings Second many commercial and industrial customers perceive no real price competition among retail suppliers for their contracts on an energy auction exchange They believe they will get more competitive bids by preparing requests for proposal and soliciting bids directly from suppliers Patchwork Regulation Because regulation varies by state and transactions vary by utility it is expensive and complex for ESPs to expand into different markets For example an ESP willing to offer a franchise deal to a national chain say McDonalds restaurants may find it virtually impossible to navigate the regulations and transactional requirements for working with the many utilities in all the states where the chain operates But Is That Rate Better A customer who visits a popular retail energy website such as Essentialcom or Energycom may be presented with a standard offer price from one ESP Is that a good price How does it compare to what he pays now Most massmarket energy customers dont know Add the fact that percent of all Internet shoppers do not complete their purchase transactions and the problem is clear Price discovery must be enhanced and the shopping and enrollment processes need to be simplified to attract novice energy buyers A TODO LIST FOR BUILDING REAL CHOICE The challenges I describe are formidable no one solution will address them all Here are some important actions necessary to help break the logjam Utilities and ESPs in particular can play a critical role in encouraging regulators at the state and federal levels to make needed changes Cap Wholesale Prices Energy companies are at the mercy of federal regulators to dampen wholesale market volatility They and state regulators should continue pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider shortterm regional price caps on wholesale electricity To mitigate gaming of the markets the FERC also should require generators to publish their annual plans for scheduled downtime and force them to explain unplanned downtime Form A MegaExchange To promote liquidity in retail energy exchanges the operators of the various exchanges should consider pooling their resources to develop a universal exchange portalor at least a virtual exchangethat most or all of the largest customers could use That way customers and suppliers could go to one site and see all deals even if the deals were posted regionally behind the scenes Such an exchange would offer various procurement vehicles including auction bidask and standard offer Suppliers also would welcome a single site where they could see all qualified deals Educate the Public Consumer education in deregulating markets clearly needs to go further Regulators in these states could follow a strategy thats been moderately successful in several states collecting money from all participating utilities and ESPs to launch a campaign to increase the publics understanding of retail choice Radio TV and print ads would explain the merits of deregulation demystifying the enrollment process and calming the fears of apprehensive customers Through this type of program for example Pennsylvania regulators saw mass market awareness of retail electric choice soar to percent in just over a year Utilities and ESPs can enhance these public awareness efforts by coordinating their own educational materials with the statewide campaign Redouble Marketing In line with the objectives to increase consumer awareness energy service providers need to do a better job of branding their service communicating their value proposition facilitating price discovery and targeting the actual buyer within commercial organizations This is a job for the professionals ESPs should hire and consult with Madison Avenue talent to develop branding and advertising campaigns ESP websites should allow a prospective customer to enter basic information from their utility bill and calculate both the commodity charge and the distribution charge demonstrating the clear impact of switching on one months bill Accuracy is critical Often the ESPs have difficulty getting this calculation right themselves Standardize Transactions Utilities and ESPs backed by a FERC directive should take the lead in developing national standards for electronic transactions including switching That would ease apprehension among customers make national contracting easier and reduce the investment required by energy suppliers to enter new markets Phase out Standard Offers State regulators should consider speeding the elimination of UDC price to beat and standard offers This price rigging creates a false economy with the customer adds undue price pressure to commodity prices and puts severe earnings pressure on utilities The crisis situation in California has made such potential consequences crystal dear Aggregate the Apathetic Some municipalities have begun aggregating their residents to form residential aggregation pools that are attractive to ESPs and wholesale suppliers If the municipality successfully addresses customer apprehension and allows disinterested customers to opt out these aggregations can be an effective way to force choice in a community at least until the next general election Energy companies and state regulators may be able to encourage aggregations by educating local officials on the benefits of such buying pools and providing materials for marketing to residents Force Choice State regulators can force all customers to choose an ESP andor bar the incumbent utility from acting as an ESP In Texas for example utilities cannot prospect for new energy supply customers outside their territory until at least percent of their franchise customers have chosen an alternative ESP For gas deregulation in Georgia all customers were assigned an ESP in proportion to the market share each ESP garnered in a pilot period Energy companies may influence legislators in deregulating states as well as federal legislators to pursue this approach Consider ReRegulation The FERC should consider guidelines to encourage states with volatile supply networks to reregulate or defer deregulation until the wholesale markets stabilize and the bugs have been ironed out of the deregulation process Simplify Rates State regulators should encourage utilities to simplify their rates for residential and small commercial customers That would allow retail suppliers and customers to more easily understand the rates and potential savings of switching to an ESP Deregulation will succeed only when all stakeholders put the success of the program before partisan interests Without the undivided support of all parties there can be little improvement on the pseudocompetitive mire we see today It just doesnt work Jeff Felton is a consultant based in

Fort Worth StarTelegram Texas FINAL Page Copyright AUSTIN Electric deregulation comes to Texas today but Texans who signed up to switch to a new power company face at least a months delay because of technical problems government and utility officials said Thursday Computers at an organization overseeing the states electric grid still cannot process the tens of thousands of requests to transfer service from one electric company to another officials said Such service transfers are the backbone of the deregulation program under which electric companies compete for customers The state begins phasing in deregulation today with a pilot project allowing customers to pick their provider Full deregulation is scheduled to begin in January Deregulation has been branded a disaster in California but Texas officials say they are being careful not to make the same mistakes Regulators are calling for virtual switching that would allow billing from new providers to start in July about a month late even if the new computers still cannot handle the load officials said Both utility groups and consumer advocates are critical of virtual switching Carol Biedrzycki a consumer advocate who helps oversee the deregulation test project said Id say we have serious problems I didnt think there would be as many technical problems as were having Im not saying theyre doing a bad job but its just much more complicated than anybody thought it would be The states deregulation law opens Texas to full retail competition among electric utilities next year But a less ambitious test project kicks off today in which companies can compete for up to percent of the market and the grid operator can test its new computer systems As part of that kickoff today the grid operator will christen its squarefoot million control center in Austin It also plans to open an squarefoot million facility next year Tom Noel executive director of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas or Ercot which operates the grid expressed optimism Thursday and played down any reported delays in the pilot project He said the council can now manage about switches a day but should be able to process about each day next month But there are aspects of the pilot that will occur later than we thought said Noel We have gone through various mock market drills and in my opinion the system does not work well enough yet to proceed Were going through it in a very deliberate way he said The challenge of managing so many switches over residential customers have requested a change under the pilot has also earned Texas a spot on a monitoring list for summertime electric problems According to a report last month by the North American Electric Reliability Council an industry organization of power grid operators the reliability councils conversion could lead to operational difficulties this summer But Noel played down the potential for difficulties and said the system should be fully operational in time for full competition in January We realize that we need to go through this at a walking pace he said Well do a small number of switches for each of the competitive retailers just to be sure that our system is working as it should The Electric Reliability Council of Texas utilities and the state Public Utility Commission have also begun discussing the implementation of the socalled virtual switch process which would bypass the fully automated system now being used say utility and regulatory officials The proposal has drawn criticism from both utility groups and consumer advocates who say it does nothing to prepare Texas for deregulation because it does not test the system that would operate when the market fully opens next year But business groups and regulators at the PUCs request continue discussing how to implement the virtual switchover TXU spokesman Christopher K Schein characterized the proposal as a sort of trophy switch that allows officials to boast that they have been able to switch customers from one company to another even though the underlying computer systems remain untested Its a system thats difficult to manage and youre focusing companies to detour resources to create a shortterm fix he said Janee Briesemeister a senior policy analyst at Consumers Union said regulators would create a pretend market through virtual switching And thats just adding additional costs onto an already very very expensive operating system she said The pilot is called a pilot for a reason and thats because the purpose is to test the systems necessary to support the new market structure Although electric competitors can serve up to percent of the market under the pilot project beginning today far fewer customers have expressed interest in changing service In the TXU service area residential customers have signed up for a competitors service That represents about percent of the customers eligible for service under the pilot and about percent of all residential customers in the TXU service area

STANDARDS May Utility Environment Report Page Copyright McGrawHill Inc Massachusetts became the first state to issue limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with the recent release of a major new plan that requires older plants to meet tougher standards for several pollutants The new regulations which take effect in June call for the states six oldest power plants which total MW to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by sulfur dioxide by as much as and CO by Power plants also must begin stack testing for mercury in preparation for mercury emissions standards that will begin Oct Issued by the state Dept of Environmental Protection the regulations apply to Sithe Energies Mystic Station in Everett NRG Energys Montaup Station in Somerset PGE National Energy Groups Salem Harbor in Salem and Brayton Point in Somerset Northeast Utilities Mount Tom Station and Mirants Canal Electric in Sandwich Although Massachusetts has emissions trading and averaging rules the new regulations prohibit use of emissions averaging between the plants to meet the standards Local citizens environmental groups and elected officials protested such averaging because they feared that PGE National Energy Group would use reductions from its Salem Mass plant to offset emissions at its Fall River Brayton Point facility creating what they described as a burden of air pollution in Fall River The rules do however allow plants to generate SO early reduction credits by operating below historical average emission rates A generating facility can use the ERCs to meet the new standards but cannot transfer the ERCs to another facility The DEP also will allow transfer of SO allowances under the Federal Acid Rain program The DEP noted that the plants will be emitting at rates lower than what the EPA requires to create allowances Therefore the plants are likely to create a substantial number of unused allowances If the plants transfer the allowances to upwind sources it could harm air quality in Massachusetts The DEP plans to monitor the situation and may limit the ability of the plants to accumulate the allowances if they are having an adverse impact on Massachusetts The rules allow use of offsite reductions and carbon sequestration to comply with the CO cap In the future it also plans to allow CO trading and will set up a Massachusetts Greenhouse Gas Reductions Registry to promote reductions and create consistency in their creation The DEP decided against issuing a standard for fine particulate matter for the time being saying there is currently insufficient technical information to support a standard and that the NOx and SO reductions will automatically reduce PM concentrations While the regulations won praise from several environmental groups the Competitive Power Coalition of New England warned that they may jeopardize reliability increase consumer costs and reduce fuel diversity CPC says that the state went back on its original proposal announced about a year ago which was supported by the plant owners Plant owners offered voluntary emissions reductions with the understanding that if they did the state would not institute new regulations The DEP however said that not all of the power plant owners submitted detailed voluntary plans And further the state agency said that it had made clear that it would incorporate the voluntary proposals in new regulations CPC said that the original proposals also did not include CO or mercury limits and did not prohibit averaging Moreover the state originally agreed to give plant owners several more years to comply setting deadlines of and to meet reductions according to Neal Costello CPC general counsel Instead the final rules call for the plants to achieve the standards between Oct and Oct Plants that repower are given more time than those that install emissions pollution control technologies Specifically plants that repower have until Oct to reduce NOx by lbsMWh using a month rolling average and SO to lbsMWh By they must reduce SO to lbsMWh Plants that do not repower have until Oct to meet the first SO and NOx standards and until Oct to meet the final SO standard For CO plants must limit emissions to lbsMWh by Oct if they install emissions reductions devices and two years later if they repower The DEP said it is giving plants more time if they repower because it will take them longer to complete design permitting and construction Its worth the wait the DEP said because repowering reduces multiple pollutants CPCs Costello said that the regulations will increase power costs at about the same time that the state is scheduled to end discounted utility standard offer service which is taken by about of the states electricity consumers The customers will then buy power at market prices which are likely to rise as the generators pass on the cost of the environmental upgrades Power plant owners have also said that the tight time frames could jeopardize system reliability because it may force plants offline simultaneously However the DEP argued that the region will not be short of supply because MW in new capacity will come on line by

Fort Worth Star Telegram Publication date Arrival time Electricity generators around the country didnt need to read the Bush administrations energy plan to know theres already a strong market for their product Its a bit of frenzy I would say Lane Kadel said of demand for the natural gasfired turbines brokered by his company Utility Warehousecom of Portland Ore The yearold enterprise originally started to help electric utilities buy and sell surplus equipment has seen demand for electricitygenerating machinery move into high voltage territory in recent months With electricity already in short supply in parts of the country headlines of rolling blackouts in California and growth projected to require more power US electricity generators have announced plans for megawatts of new capacity Thats equal to about percent of the nations existing generating capacity So it was no surprise to anybody in the industry that electricity figured prominently Thursday in President Bushs energy plan The plan largely emphasizes the need to add more energy supplies projecting that the nation will need to add megawatts of capacity by In the nation added megawatts of new capacity according to the Energy Department Bushs plan also aims to speed up additions to generating capacity by easing licensing permitting and other regulatory review including rules to encourage more nuclear power plants The Bush plan industry people say apparently contains nothing to discourage the industrys push to add supply If there is we havent seen it said Mark Stultz vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association a group of independent power producers The plans for new capacity that have already been announced represent more than billion in potential investment in new electricity supply Not all the planned capacity will be built at least not right away said Tom Rose vice president of public affairs at TXU in Dallas But a lot will and the projects that are postponed will probably still go through permitting and land acquisition things that dont cost a lot of money Rose said With that groundwork done new capacity could come on line all the faster when the market justifies it he said The emphasis on adding supply doesnt please everyone in the electricity business Jerry Davia president of Orion Energy in Sausalito Calif would rather see the government encourage investment in energy efficiency Davias company consults with companies including San Antoniobased HE Butt Grocery Co to design and finance energysaving systems Theres tons of new energyefficient technology out there all the time he said Theres enough conservation to tackle any problems we have Energy users are probably in the best position to decide which energy efficiencies make sense financially but the government could make the economics more attractive with tax credits and other incentives he said I dont see anything that bodes well in the Bush plan as far as subsidies and credits he said And theres nothing just for California Thats fine with Karl Rabago managing director of the Rocky Mountain Institute a notforprofit organization that advocates efficient use of resources including energy Rabago said he doesnt want energy use subsidized because that shortcircuits the market mechanism that forces users to reduce consumption in response to higher prices At the same time he also doesnt like aspects of the Bush plan that he believes subsidize energy production Jesper Michaelsen sales manager for wind turbine manufacturer NEG Micon USA of Rolling Hills Ill said he was disappointed that Bushs plan doesnt set any specific goals for increasing the amount of power generated from renewable sources Wind and solar sources account for just percent of the nations total electricity market But Allen Barnett who heads solar panel maker AstroPower of Newark Del said hes thankful for any attention at all given the oilandgas backgrounds of many Bush advisers The Bush plan does include tax credits for people who purchase solar panels Its the most we could hope for Barnett said I didnt expect them to abandon their roots The Bush electricity measures that dont deal with adding generating capacity address ways to build a bigger transmission system to carry power from generators to users Two major recommendations include the creation of a national electricity grid and giving federal regulators power to condemn private property for infrastructure improvements such as new electrical transmission lines and natural gas pipelines to deliver fuel to new generators Today the United States has three regional electricity transmission grids Western Eastern and Texas which is mostly on its own grid and unlike energystrapped states such as California has a surplus of electricity Texas is virtually unconnected to the two regional grids and the two regional grids likewise arent efficiently linked Its going to lead to a lot of new investment utility analyst Barry Abramson of the UBS Warburg investment firm said of Bushs proposals Right now the country is full of transmission bottlenecks that make the system less efficient and hinder competition and the delivery of power The Texas Legislature commissioned a study into tying Texas into the national grids and concluded that it would cost million to million TXUs Rose said It is not easy he said It all has to be done at the same time because the amount of electricity moving between grids would quickly overload one or two connecting lines Rose also said many states including Texas already allow governments to condemn private property a process called eminent domain Public transportation projects provide the most common use of eminent domain along with the construction of pipelines Kadel said boosting the nations electricity infrastructure might be just as important as adding generating capacity Right now you dont have any way to move the electricity so prices are high he said
