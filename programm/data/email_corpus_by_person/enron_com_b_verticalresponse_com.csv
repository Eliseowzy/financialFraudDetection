How many email addresses do you have Based on the number of readers telling us about their new email addresses wed guess most of you and your contacts have more than one Now ACT does allow you to enter multiple email addresses for a contact in the email field but the process to use an email other than the default is cumbersome Those of you experienced with adding or defining fields in ACT have

Synchronization by Douglas Wolf One of the challenges that face ACT users is mobility If you are a salesperson working at an office and you would also like to be diligently working at home in the evening or on weekends you have to setup some sort of synchronization process The question is which process will work best to accomplish the synchronization easily and reliably If you have a laptop computer that you can bring to the office and connect to the network or directly to a desktop computer the best way is database to database synchronization This version of synchronization works between two databases only That means you cannot sync database A with database B and database C The process is to sync between the laptop and the network before leaving for home and then synch again when returning to the office So you have to understand that you have databases to keep up to date the one on your laptop computer and the office database There are quite a few steps required in order to do this so please click on the link below so you can print out the entire article with step by step instructions For the complete article on Database to Database Synchronization by Douglas Wolf

and have not been edited Enjoy Clearing Many Alarms at Once by Rose D in Seattle WA I tried this today and since it worked I thought Id tell you We set alarms on our task listwhich contains dozens of call to make a day The alarms pop up sometimes at a time Today on the display of ringing alarms I clicked select all and then go to A Look Up was created of the contacts with alarms ringing I then clicked Clear Alarm and the alarms on all these tasks were cleared This saves a lot of steps Looking Up Contacts Chronologically by Douglas B in Miami FL Ive found that the easiest way to look someone up is by their last nameAlt LL Have you ever tried to find a contact when you cant recall their name How about when you also cant remember which day you met Years ago I would log everyone I met into a notebook so I had a chronological list of the people Id met Its amazing but ACT does not allow you to create a chronological sort sorting on the create date field is prohibited Heres a useful workaround for this deficiency Create a new field mine is named create date b Set the field as required and date format then make sure it is a tab stop Every time you create a new record you will be forced to enter the date in your new create date b field This is a minor inconvenience when you consider that you will now be able to sort lookups by create date b Just tap F right click on the column label and tap add columns to view to add the new field to your list view Now tapping at the top of this column will sort your contacts by create date This may improve your followup by allowing you to see your contacts in the order they were created It will also allow you to figure out the name of that guy you met last week If you have your own ACT Tricks for us to include next month let us know by
