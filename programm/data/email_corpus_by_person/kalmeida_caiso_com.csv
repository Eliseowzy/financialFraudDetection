following quoted response that I found I will get further clarification In its November Order FERC outlined a series of flaws in the California markets and proposed a number of measured designed to reform the market One of such proposals what that the ISO modify its single price auction so that bids above MWh could not set the market clearing price that is paid to all bidders and imposing certain reporting and monitoring requirements for transactions and bids above the MWh breakpoint Pursuant to FERCs November Order the ISO filed Amendment with FERC on December which was approved on the same day On December FERC issued an Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets and further clarified its December Order Pursuant to Amendment effective December FERC authorized the ISO to set a soft bid cap for the purchase of realtime energy The order specified that although the ISO would pay those entities bidding above the soft cap as bid all bids above the breakpoint would be are subject to market refund following FERCs review of the bid data in order to ensure just and reasonable rates Effective December FERCs order authorized the ISO to assess the costs of realtime purchases above the soft cap and allocate to SCs which underschedule load the difference between the interval MCP and the bid price above the soft cap bid prices to SCs which underschedule load The ISO created CT to accomplish this allocation Please see the following excerpt from the FERC December order Docket No EL et al On December the ISO filed Tariff Amendment No in Docket No ER seeking expedited consideration of tariff revisions to address emergency reliability conditions The filing sought three modification of the ISOs tariff immediate implementation of an interim price mitigation proposal based on the breakpoint concept that was proposed in the November Order at MWh to encourage greater participation of generators in its markets provision of penalties on generators that fail to respond to dispatch instructions during a system emergency to become effective December and allocation of the costs of obtaining additional energy to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISOs realtime Imbalance Energy market as an incentive to loads to purchase energy in the forward markets The ISO requested an effective date of December for the third modification The commission approved the tariff revisions in an order issued December with the effective dates requested by the ISO After an extensive review the ISO has concluded that the charges for purchases above the soft cap break point currently set at mwh although high are consistent with the filing approved by FERC FERC continues to review the just and reasonableness of all bids dispatched in our realtime market that are above the breakpoint and will order market refund if the dispatched bid price is not found to be just and reasonable The ISO continues to review this issue and is considering alternative allocation methods which would continue to be consistent with the tariff Keoni Almeida California Independent System Operator phone pager alpha page email mailto Original Message From
