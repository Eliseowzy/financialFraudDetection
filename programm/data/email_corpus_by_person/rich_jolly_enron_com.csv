understandinterpret the Gallup contract we can completely avoid electrical power demand charges approximately per month if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period If we can not shut down the unit we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day PM Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day Through access to TriStates history data I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be I can look at the current days usage and estimate if todays peak will be higher than the higher of my estimated peak or the actual peak so far this month If so the Probability today is a peak will be near indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today The Probability now is peak approached when an actual peak is underway The TriState Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway Note that it is impossible to predict with accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak If the first day of the month has an estimated peak and last years peak for the same month was It appears possible that this will be a power peak day Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was Now on the second day of the month the estimated peak is not likely to be a power peak day The third day has an estimated peak of a possible power peak day If the actual for the third day is it now becomes the new peak for the month If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below they are not likely to be power peaks and unit turndown is not required The point is to completely avoid demand charges we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month and also on the third day The utility integrates their peak over a minute period thus the minimum time the unit could be down Im guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month So far this month I guessed a power peak on starting at and ending at The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was starting at lasting to Im sorry for any confusion I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators If there are any additional questions do not hesitate to call me at

Todd Schoolcraft Darrell Subject Re FW Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points Rich Rick Operations the Gas Controllers didnt know about this till yesterday when alarms started to appear in Houston Im not sure what is expected from operations In the last paragraph of Garys letter he indicates shutting down for minutes times a month Is that what he is saying Let us know what you find out Thanks

Points We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us by Gary Choquettes Peak Power Predictor His message below describes their function better than I would Ive listed the points below with their descriptions alarm values and comment Although these points are listed with the other AnalogDiscrete points they are not coming from the field RTU They will act like normal points so its easy to put them together For those using the intranet Adhoc reports they will show up on that The key is that the Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in CC and the Analogs end in SC We also try to include the CLC in the description to depict that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems Register Description Alarm Value Garys Comments GALPCC TriState Data Old site Unavail CLC Normal Alarm can not retrieve data from TriStates site GALPCC TriState Calc OffLine Data Error CLC Normal Alarm utility is offline or error in the data GALPCC TriState Power Peak In Progress CLC Normal Peak a power peak is currently in progress GALPSC Probability Today is Peak CLC HI HIHI A number between and indicating that today is likely to be a power peak day GALPSC Probability Now is Peak CLC HI HIHI A number between and indicating that a power peak is active now GALPSC Peak Time hourmin CLC Please let me know if you have any questions Thanks Angela Sayegh

Subject Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Ive a working prototype of a peak power predictor for Gallup This utility downloads actual power load conditions from an FTP site It also downloads predicted temperatures for Albuquerque Denver Fort Collins and Colorado Springs Using a combination of neural nets and rolling average time bins I am able to estimate the peak TriState demand for the day and hourly profiles for their load This utility will upload to Gas Control using the following registers Note the Probability Today is Peak can possibly be used to reduce interruptible volumes at nomination time if there is a high probability that today is a peak Currently the peak is integrated over a minute period This means that the unit must be completely shutoff for at least minutes in order to completely avoid a power peak Because we may hit multiple new peaks during the month I estimate we will have around indicated peaks per month Gary Choquette
