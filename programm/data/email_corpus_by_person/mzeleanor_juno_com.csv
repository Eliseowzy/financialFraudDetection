we hope this was recommended by a friend The Motley Fool does not verify the senders email address Thank you Foolcom Annuities Annuities Whats to Like retirementannuitiesannuitieshtm Annuities Whats to Like As we so often do lets start with some Foolish conclusions on annuities so those who absolutely dont want to read all about them have a quick exit strategy and then explain what they actually are Its no secret that within the confines of Fooldom were not enamored with taxdeferred annuities TDAs We do not find ourselves waxing eloquent sending chocolates or writing Foolish love poems to annuities as we sometimes do to individual stocks The reasons for this are that annuities by and large are too expensive offer mediocre insurance coverage restrict the owners investment choices to soso hohum quasimutual fund subaccounts do as advertised provide for taxdeferred investment growth yet that growth is taxed at ordinary income tax rates on withdrawal lack liquidity We strongly believe that Foolish investors can generally do far better for themselves elsewhere Indeed unless you simply havent been keeping up with the stories of how brokers are getting rich with big commissions and feel a bizarre need to help out the brokerage community you should maintain a strong bias against annuities They are desirable only if ever for those who Have contributed the maximum to their k plans and IRAs and desire further tax deferral on investment gains Prefer investing in mutual funds as opposed to individual securities Will keep the annuity for at least to years Are in a or higher income tax bracket today but expect to be in a lower income tax bracket in retirement Dont need the annuity proceeds prior to age Are unconcerned that heirs must pay ordinary income taxes on any appreciation Desire a guaranteed income for life in retirement If you meet all of those conditions then an annuity may be quite appropriate but thats a pretty select group of people Nevertheless annuities are promoted and sold by brokers and insurance agents like theyre the some kind of panacea for your retirement Is that right The Basics Lets back up for a moment and now that were in the middle of things restart from the beginning What after all is a taxdeferred annuity Regardless of who sells it to you broker k plan Martian a TDA is a contract between you and an insurance company In exchange for getting your hardearned cash today the insurance company agrees to pay you an income for a specified period or for your life Those payments may start at some date in the future or they may start on the day you buy the contract If the payments are delayed until the future you have whats called a deferred annuity If the payments start immediately you have an immediate annuity You pay for an immediate annuity with a lump sum of cash on the day you buy it You pay for a deferred annuity either with a single lumpsum payment or with a series of payments made over a number of years Your investment in the annuity will earn a return and those earnings will grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments Be aware though that unless you purchase an annuity within an IRA you will receive no tax deduction for any investment you make in a TDA just a tax deferral on your annuity investment earnings The Types Taxdeferred annuities come in three flavors fixed variable and equityindex Fixed Annuities As the name implies a fixed annuity provides a lockedin guaranteed rate of return on the investment and a fixed stable income in its payout phase A fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income but this steady return can and will be eroded by inflation Options are available at a price always at a price to have your annuity payments increase by to each year should you so desire When used the payments under that feature would initially be lower than a fixed payment but over the years the payments will steadily increase at the specified rate For those expecting to live many years the added cost of this feature might be worth the price but expect to pay dearly for this option Variable Annuities Probably the most popular form of annuity these days a variable annuity allows the purchaser to decide how to invest the money within a range of mutual fund lookalike investment options offered by the insurance company These investments are called subaccounts They often carry the same name and are operated by the same investment managers as publicly offered mutual funds and they will typically offer a selection of stock bond and money market subaccount investments Nevertheless they are not the same funds because by law they cannot be While these subaccounts may invest much like a mutual fund subaccounts almost certainly will have a different and higher expense structure and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund Thus like a mutual fund and unlike the fixed annuity the returns of the variable annuity are not stable and will vary along with the markets While this variability does carry downside risk it nevertheless affords the annuity buyer the ability to participate in the potentially greater returns of the stock market As the stock market rises so does income derived from an investment in a stock subaccount Conversely as the market declines so will income Still over the longterm a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should provide a much better opportunity for inflationprotected income than a fixed annuity Equityindex Annuity A recent innovation in the insurance industry an equityindex annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock index that provides the opportunity to earn returns better than those in a traditional fixed annuity but less than those of a direct investment in the market itself In this contract the insurance company invests in a mix of bonds and stock options designed to give a targeted participation rate explained below on the return of a particular index eg the SP Index While the purchaser has no choice in the investment itself he or she is able to participate to a degree in stock market gains during a rising market If stocks fall then the contract guarantees a minimum return typically Because of that guarantee the equityindex annuity has less downward volatility than the variable annuity Theres no such thing as a free lunch however so the equityindex annuity will also limit the maximum returns of a rising market as compensation for that guarantee Most equityindex annuities use something called a participation rate to limit returns For instance the insurance company may declare a participation rate of some companies are as low as which means the annuity would be credited with only of the gain experienced by the equity index for that year If the index gained then the gain in the annuity would be for the year And thats not the only way these annuities limit the return Most will also tie equityindex returns to those deriving from market price changes only and exclude any return due to the payment of dividends As an example in the total return ie capital gains and dividends for the SP Index as reported by Ibbotson Associates was while that for just capital gains ie market price was An equityindexed annuity tied to the SP Index would typically use the smaller return Couple that with a participation rate of and the return in the index annuity becomes just some below the total return of the market Hows that for a doublewhammy Its Your Choice For retirees an annuity offers the assurance of a stream of income for life or for a specific period of time For those who fear the potential loss of all their money because of poor investment choices that guarantee is important As Fools we recognize that this fear factor is real and does enter into many peoples investment decisions Accordingly we fault no one who chooses lower risk approaches and thats especially true of those who are retired But as Fools we do urge those interested in annuities to recognize their costs their investment limitations and their limited potential for passing on wealth to heirs If after evaluating all those factors an annuity still appears appropriate then as Fools we also urge the purchase of a lowcost annuity such as one offered by Vanguard T Rowe Price Fidelity AnnuityNetcom or in some states TIAACREF Why pay commissions and high expenses when you dont have to That enriches the fat cats at your expense and no Fool wants to do that Keep the money in your pocket instead Annuities market themselves on the basis of their ability to avoid taxation on investment growth through taxdeferral While it is true that taxes on earnings are deferred within an annuity this may not be achieved in a way that is quite as useful as it sounds Read about the real pros and cons of annuity taxdeferral next Next Annuity Taxation The Motley Fool is dedicated to Educating Amusing and Enriching all visitors to their website at

pitcher is beautiful and the colors are perfect as you know The shape reminds me very much of one that Mother had at home When Janet saw it the first thing she said was that the shape was reminiscent of earlier days I really like it Thank you so much Dad went out and bought a rose that matched the one on the card almost perfectly Unfortunately the real one only lasted one day before it drooped Our trip to MD was quick but nice Our flights were uneventfulthe best kind Tim and Elena were at National Airport to meet us They came on the Metro so we were able to scope that out in case we take it from their house to the airport some morning in the future Since Comair has discontinued their Weekender Program we will have to take regular flights and can go on Fri night and fly into National The Metro doesnt go all the way to Dulles Elena has grown inches since Christmas according to Sharon It wasnt immediately apparent to us but she does communicate better each time we see her and she amuses herself better this time than when we were there in October They are in the process of deciding whether to adopt a baby boy from Russia I have about herbs in the back yard waiting to be planted I am quite frustrated because I havent had time to do it It is time to put the flowers in as well and I dont have them purchased yet The man finished with our deck yesterday so I can put the planters on the deck now too anytime This week I wish I werent working This happens to me nearly every year There is a big push after May the frost date and I cant work fast enough I cant exactly put my finger on what I have been doing to take up the time except that there are three birthdays to shop for and two parties for which I at least bake cakes Emilys dinner was at their house Nicks was here last Monday He wanted goldenrod eggs so that was simple I hadnt make them in years and years One thing that has taken time is Dr and dentist appointments I had my six month dentist checkup and decided that I might as well have a tooth extracted that has been giving me trouble The dentist says it cant be saved The endodontist was not able to clear out one of the roots because it was calcified and the root looks questionable I have an appointment for the extraction sometime in June Then later I will have a bridge put in on that side The day after Easter I awoke with my left eyelid drooping more than usual It has been quite uncomfortable ever since some days aching all day It doesnt quite interfere with my vision but is certainly not normal I saw our ophthalmologist two weeks ago and a specialist this past week He has scheduled a CT scan for Tuesday He thinks is it may be a result of the thyroid Graves Disease I had in The scan is to rule out anything else If it is from the thyroid he says it may eventually correct itself but may take one or two YEARS I am grateful these things are not really serious problems We learned this week that a good friend from church our piano tuner has Alzheimers Disease That was a real shocker Did we tell you that our minister is retiring He is moving most of his household this weekend He isnt leaving till the end of June but his sons were free this weekend to help him move so Dad arranged for six or seven men to help them load the rental truck yesterday and another man from the church who drives for Krogers drove the truck to Lancaster Ohio where they have bought a house Dad took a load in our van and helped them unload both van and truck in Lancaster He had to detour to our car dealer because the sliding door window of the van fell out when he closed it at the parsonage They just put it back in with duct tape and referred him to a glass place tomorrow Yesterday afternoon I helped prepare serve and clean up after a wedding reception at the church One of our most active members has been a widow for years Her husband died when their children were small and she raised them alone She was remarried yesterday to the husband of her cousin who died last year I am happy for her Each of them has sold their house and together they have bought a cottage at Otterbein Retirement Center in Lebanonjust up the road a piece She is I dont know how old he iscomparable I believe Dad preached in church today and I played the organlike old times I wish you could have heard our bell choir arrangement of Dry Bones It was amusing and a lot of fun to play It almost reminded us of the old Spike Jones Band arrangements Dad tied it in with his sermon and the scripture from Elijah The new minister that has been assigned to our church is a womana first for our church That will be interesting Her husband is also ordained and will be serving a church in Clevesthe next community down the road from Saylor Park where Eden Chapel is located They will be living in our parsonage so he will have quite a commute This is a second career for each of them She has been serving churches for years Well I really have been rambling on I hope you

commissions and feel a bizarre need to help out the brokerage community you should maintain a strong bias against annuities They are desirable only if ever for those who Have contributed the maximum to their k plans and IRAs and desire further tax deferral on investment gains Prefer investing in mutual funds as opposed to individual securities Will keep the annuity for at least to years Are in a or higher income tax bracket today but expect to be in a lower income tax bracket in retirement Dont need the annuity proceeds prior to age Are unconcerned that heirs must pay ordinary income taxes on any appreciation Desire a guaranteed income for life in retirement If you meet all of those conditions then an annuity may be quite appropriate but thats a pretty select group of people Nevertheless annuities are promoted and sold by brokers and insurance agents like theyre the some kind of panacea for your retirement Is that right The Basics Lets back up for a moment and now that were in the middle of things restart from the beginning What after all is a taxdeferred annuity Regardless of who sells it to you broker k plan Martian a TDA is a contract between you and an insurance company In exchange for getting your hardearned cash today the insurance company agrees to pay you an income for a specified period or for your life Those payments may start at some date in the future or they may start on the day you buy the contract If the payments are delayed until the future you have whats called a deferred annuity If the payments start immediately you have an immediate annuity You pay for an immediate annuity with a lump sum of cash on the day you buy it You pay for a deferred annuity either with a single lumpsum payment or with a series of payments made over a number of years Your investment in the annuity will earn a return and those earnings will grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments Be aware though that unless you purchase an annuity within an IRA you will receive no tax deduction for any investment you make in a TDA just a tax deferral on your annuity investment earnings The Types Taxdeferred annuities come in three flavors fixed variable and equityindex Fixed Annuities As the name implies a fixed annuity provides a lockedin guaranteed rate of return on the investment and a fixed stable income in its payout phase A fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income but this steady return can and will be eroded by inflation Options are available at a price always at a price to have your annuity payments increase by to each year should you so desire When used the payments under that feature would initially be lower than a fixed payment but over the years the payments will steadily increase at the specified rate For those expecting to live many years the added cost of this feature might be worth the price but expect to pay dearly for this option Variable Annuities Probably the most popular form of annuity these days a variable annuity allows the purchaser to decide how to invest the money within a range of mutual fund lookalike investment options offered by the insurance company These investments are called subaccounts They often carry the same name and are operated by the same investment managers as publicly offered mutual funds and they will typically offer a selection of stock bond and money market subaccount investments Nevertheless they are not the same funds because by law they cannot be While these subaccounts may invest much like a mutual fund subaccounts almost certainly will have a different and higher expense structure and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund Thus like a mutual fund and unlike the fixed annuity the returns of the variable annuity are not stable and will vary along with the markets While this variability does carry downside risk it nevertheless affords the annuity buyer the ability to participate in the potentially greater returns of the stock market As the stock market rises so does income derived from an investment in a stock subaccount Conversely as the market declines so will income Still over the longterm a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should provide a much better opportunity for inflationprotected income than a fixed annuity Equityindex Annuity A recent innovation in the insurance industry an equityindex annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock index that provides the opportunity to earn returns better than those in a traditional fixed annuity but less than those of a direct investment in the market itself In this contract the insurance company invests in a mix of bonds and stock options designed to give a targeted participation rate explained below on the return of a particular index eg the SP Index While the purchaser has no choice in the investment itself he or she is able to participate to a degree in stock market gains during a rising market If stocks fall then the contract guarantees a minimum return typically Because of that guarantee the equityindex annuity has less downward volatility than the variable annuity Theres no such thing as a free lunch however so the equityindex annuity will also limit the maximum returns of a rising market as compensation for that guarantee Most equityindex annuities use something called a participation rate to limit returns For instance the insurance company may declare a participation rate of some companies are as low as which means the annuity would be credited with only of the gain experienced by the equity index for that year If the index gained then the gain in the annuity would be for the year And thats not the only way these annuities limit the return Most will also tie equityindex returns to those deriving from market price changes only and exclude any return due to the payment of dividends As an example in the total return ie capital gains and dividends for the SP Index as reported by Ibbotson Associates was while that for just capital gains ie market price was An equityindexed annuity tied to the SP Index would typically use the smaller return Couple that with a participation rate of and the return in the index annuity becomes just some below the total return of the market Hows that for a doublewhammy Its Your Choice For retirees an annuity offers the assurance of a stream of income for life or for a specific period of time For those who fear the potential loss of all their money because of poor investment choices that guarantee is important As Fools we recognize that this fear factor is real and does enter into many peoples investment decisions Accordingly we fault no one who chooses lower risk approaches and thats especially true of those who are retired But as Fools we do urge those interested in annuities to recognize their costs their investment limitations and their limited potential for passing on wealth to heirs If after evaluating all those factors an annuity still appears appropriate then as Fools we also urge the purchase of a lowcost annuity such as one offered by Vanguard T Rowe Price Fidelity AnnuityNetcom or in some states TIAACREF Why pay commissions and high expenses when you dont have to That enriches the fat cats at your expense and no Fool wants to do that Keep the money in your pocket instead Annuities market themselves on the basis of their

pitcher is beautiful and the colors are perfect as you know The shape reminds me very much of one that Mother had at home When Janet saw it the first thing she said was that the shape was reminiscent of earlier days I really like it Thank you so much Dad went out and bought a rose that matched the one on the card almost perfectly Unfortunately the real one only lasted one day before it drooped Our trip to MD was quick but nice Our flights were uneventfulthe best kind Tim and Elena were at National Airport to meet us They came on the Metro so we were able to scope that out in case we take it from their house to the airport some morning in the future Since Comair has discontinued their Weekender Program we will have to take regular flights and can go on Fri night and fly into National The Metro doesnt go all the way to Dulles Elena has grown inches since Christmas according to Sharon It wasnt immediately apparent to us but she does communicate better each time we see her and she amuses herself better this time than when we were there in October They are in the process of deciding whether to adopt a baby boy from Russia I have about herbs in the back yard waiting to be planted I am quite frustrated because I havent had time to do it It is time to put the flowers in as well and I dont have them purchased yet The man finished with our deck yesterday so I can put the planters on the deck now too anytime This week I wish I werent working This happens to me nearly every year There is a big push after May the frost date and I cant work fast enough I cant exactly put my finger on what I have been doing to take up the time except that there are three birthdays to shop for and two parties for which I at least bake cakes Emilys dinner was at their house Nicks was here last Monday He wanted goldenrod eggs so that was simple I hadnt make them in years and years One thing that has taken time is Dr and dentist appointments I had my six month dentist checkup and decided that I might as well have a tooth extracted that has been giving me trouble The dentist says it cant be saved The endodontist was not able to clear out one of the roots because it was calcified and the root looks questionable I have an appointment for the extraction sometime in June Then later I will have a bridge put in on that side The day after Easter I awoke with my left eyelid drooping more than usual It has been quite uncomfortable ever since some days aching all day It doesnt quite interfere with my vision but is certainly not normal I saw our ophthalmologist two weeks ago and a specialist this past week He has scheduled a CT scan for Tuesday He thinks is it may be a result of the thyroid Graves Disease I had in The scan is to rule out anything else If it is from the thyroid he says it may eventually correct itself but may take one or two YEARS I am grateful these things are not really serious problems We learned this week that a good friend from church our piano tuner has Alzheimers Disease That was a real shocker Did we tell you that our minister is retiring He is moving most of his household this weekend He isnt leaving till the end of June but his sons were free this weekend to help him move so Dad arranged for six or seven men to help them load the rental truck yesterday and another man from the church who drives for Krogers drove the truck to Lancaster Ohio where they have bought a house Dad took a load in our van and helped them unload both van and truck in Lancaster He had to detour to our car dealer because the sliding door window of the van fell out when he closed it at the parsonage They just put it back in with duct tape and referred him to a glass place tomorrow Yesterday afternoon I helped prepare serve and clean up after a wedding reception at the church One of our most active members has been a widow for years Her husband died when their children were small and she raised them alone She was remarried yesterday to the husband of her cousin who died last year I am happy for her Each of them has sold their house and together they have bought a cottage at Otterbein Retirement Center in Lebanonjust up the road a piece She is I dont know how old he iscomparable I believe Dad preached in church today and I played the organlike old times I wish you could have heard our bell choir arrangement of Dry Bones It was amusing and a lot of fun to play It almost reminded us of the old Spike Jones Band arrangements Dad tied it in with his sermon and the scripture from Elijah The new minister that has been assigned to our church is a womana first for our church That will be interesting Her husband is also ordained and will be serving a church in Clevesthe next community down the road from Saylor Park where Eden Chapel is located They will be living in our parsonage so he will have quite a commute This is a second career for each of them She has been serving churches for years Well I really have been rambling on I hope you
