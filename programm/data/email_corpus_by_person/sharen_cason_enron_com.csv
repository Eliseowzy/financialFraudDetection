<10436645.1075841866838.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sharen.cason@enron.com,2001-01-31 01:14:00,contacts Cc Currently we do not confirm west deals that flow days or less so we have not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry However starting February we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west using the same criteria we do in the east that is deals days or less are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing else on a letter requiring a signature Hourly deals will not be confirmed So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are entering deals The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact name It stops the whole process We are not going to be able to put names in every time they do not If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list put the correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day If you can help us out with this maybe we wont have to keep asking you for contacts Thanks
