agreed that it would not be prudent for individual pipelines representatives to attend the coalition meetings Sunday Monday The tone of the meeting announcements made it clear that this grass roots group is not receptive towards receiving information on pipeline safety records Terry Boss of INGAA attended the meeting Included in the audience were the parents of the Bellinghamvictims and members of Safe Bellingham and the speeches were not surprisingly politica l in tone the inadequacy of OPS and the need for funds for state safety measures OPS should be restructured FERC should be restructured the EIS process is a joke Here are samples of some newspaper articles that INGAA forwarded Just because we didnt take an active role in the Coalition meeting doesnt mean we arent moving forward at developing our legislative Enron recommended INGAA strategy Dave Phil Jeff and I met on Monday Jeff reports that while pipeline oversight legislation is unlikely this year we will absolutely have to deal with the appropriations issue added user fees Jeff is outlining a compromise position that he thinks could be politically feasible something along the lines that we can live with add ed user fees directed towards one call and public education programs Well g et this outline out shortly I want to get it in Bob Hills hands before the INGAA Board meeting Pipeline officials hear hard questions SUMMIT Parents of Wade King Stephen Tsiorvas speak to panel Stephen Power The Bellingham Herald WASHINGTON DC The nations top pipeline regulator and a White House environmental aide came under sharp questioning Monday when the parents of two children killed in a Bellingham pipeline blast confronted them at a conference of safety activists With more than four dozen audience members watching one of the parents Frank King handed a picture of his yearold son Wade to White House aide Gabrielle Tenzer and asked her to deliver it to President Clinton Ask him what he would have done if Chelsea had been standing by that creek King said referring to Whatcom Creek where his son was playing last June when the explosion occurred in the pipeline of Olympic Pipe Line Co Another parent Katherine Dalen drew applause when she stood and told federal pipeline regulator Richard Felder that the concept of safety means something different to me than it does to you She later handed Tenzer a funeral program with the picture of her yearold son Stephen Tsiorvas who died along with Wade and yearold Liam Wood The tense exchanges occurred on the second day of the National Pipeline Safety Reform Conference a gathering of environmentalists local governmen t leaders and citizens who want tougher regulations on underground fuel pipelines Administration officials who attended the conference Monday Tenzer Felder and Assistant Attorney General Lois Schiffer outlined their efforts to prevent pipeline accidents and told participants that the federal Transportation Department planned to propose safety reforms But audience members chortled at some of the panelists remarks and expressed frustration with the performance of the US Office of Pipeline Safety the federal agency that regulates the nations pipelines Were really chagrined that there was no one here from the administration the past two days taking notes said Susan Harper executive director of Cascade Columbia Alliance a Seattle group that helped block Olympic Pipe Lines proposed crossCascades fuel pipeline in Washington last year Tha t was a big oversight on your part As part of the US Transportation Department the Office of Pipeline Safet y regulates more than miles of hazardous liquid lines and more than million miles of natural gas lines throughout the country But with on ly inspectors to cover more than million miles of pipe nationwide criti cs have questioned the agencys effectiveness The agency has also drawn attention for sharply limiting the role states ca n play in policing interstate pipelines a trend that delights oil and gas interests but worries some local governments Felder said his agency has allowed Olympic Pipe Line to continue operating because the company has performed appropriate testing of its lines But h e acknowledged the agency wouldnt know the cause of the Bellingham accident until the National Transportation Safety Board completes its probe The boards investigation has stalled in recent months because some Olympic employees have refused to cooperate fearing their testimony could be used by prosecutors in a potential criminal case Wed also like to know more about how the Bellingham accident occurred In the end we will have some of these answers said Felder who is th e pipeline offices associate administrator But he said the less information we have the more cautious we are and the more conservative we are Felders comments drew an angry response from Frank King who waved a newspaper clipping about a daycare center in his state that was shut down immediately when a child in its custody died of undetermined causes I find it outrageous King said This is the only time Ive ever seen where one person is allowed to continue operating after murdering three children Felder said he is encouraging states to focus on intrastate lines such as natural gas lines that heat homes The vast majority of pipeline accidents about percent involve such intrastate systems according to federal records He also said most accidents occur as a result of third parties such as construction crews that dig without checking for fuel lines Were very interested in state input he said But youve got to look at where the risks are They arent in the big lines Theyre in the small lines Tenzer did not respond directly to King when he approached her but told a reporter afterward that she would make sure Clinton received the picture She declined to answer when a reporter asked her for the White Houses vie w of the Office of Pipeline Safetys performance Reach Stephen Power at or call Pipeline Reform Summit in Washington DC Industry lobbyist takes notes for OPS GOVERNMENT Official shrugs off potential conflict of interest Khurram Saeed The Bellingham Herald WASHINGTON DC Just when it looked like it couldnt get any worse for the federal Office of Pipeline Safety it did The head of OPS told a reporter Monday that a lobbyist for a natural gas association had been taking notes about pipeline safety reform on OPS behalf for the past two days at a national pipeline conference OPS the agency responsible for overseeing the nations interstate pipelines has been at the center of fierce criticism by pipeline activist s over the years for being too close to the fuel industry That cozy relationship has put corporate profits above public safety pipeline reformers contend Some conference speakers laughed out loud and shook their heads in disbelie f when told that Richard Felder was relying on the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America for information about the conference Its perfect said Virginia attorney Jim Pates an outspoken and longtime critic of OPS It reflects not only the closeness of the relationship but the insensitivity of how it appears to the public Felder dismissed any potential for conflict of interest even though his agency monitors companies that belong to the gas association He said he knew half of the people in the room and was familiar with their concern s thus the notes wouldnt tell him something he didnt already know Im not worried about getting the issues because theres a roomful of people wholl send them to me Felder said after speaking at the conference Earlier in the day several speakers publicly questioned why OPS hadnt sen t a representative such as a note taker or public relations person to the meeting that covered such topics as improving pipeline safety standards protecting whistleblowers and granting more authority to local governments Its a professional organization that should be listening to us said Susan Harper head of a Puget Sound environmental group that fought Olympi c Pipe Line Cos proposed Cascade pipeline Whether they like us or not they should be here Terry Boss vice president of safety and operations for the natural gas association said he was taking notes on his organizations behalf and offered to share them with OPS Im just doing a favor Boss said Would it be better for OPS to have someone here or for OPS not to have someone here Frank King whose yearold son was killed in last Junes Bellingham pipeline explosion said it was ironic that officials from the agency that needs to learn about pipeline safety the most werent there in person for the twoday conference Their arrogance is evident everywhere we go he said Its perfect It reflects not only the closeness of the relationship but the insensitivity of how it appears to the public Chances dim this year for pipeline laws POLITICS Keep pushing pipeline activists at conference are told Khurram Saeed The Bellingham Herald WASHINGTON DC Two congressional bills seeking to reform the nations pipeline industry might not become law until next year two Washington sta te pipeline reformers said Monday In itself the announcement wasnt all that surprising given that change comes slowly here particularly for industries with powerful connections and lots of money to spend on lobbying What was unexpected was the concession from pipeline reformers who have stated in the past that the current political climate an election year with lingering shockwaves from the Bellingham tragedy and pending reauthorization of the federal Office of Pipeline Safety was ideal for immediate change Two proposed laws Senate Bill introduced by Sen Patty Murray DWash and House Bill brought forward by Rep Jack Metcalf RLangl ey would impose strict standards on pipeline operators Both bills are sti ll in committee The committee chair must support the bill to send it for a full vote That s not likely to happen this session considering there are bills ahead of Murrays bill in the Senate Commerce Committee And Metcalf said he is having a hard time getting colleagues interested in buried pipelines The phrase out of sight out of mind certainly applies when pipelines are concerned he told conference attendees in a speech Even if we dont get a bill out this year we need to keep working on this said Carl Weimer executive director of SAFE Bellingham a local pipeline activist group that has gained national stature David Bricklin the Seattle attorney who has represented several cities including Bellingham against Olympic Pipe Line Co said the delay could b e a blessing in disguise Sometimes in a rush to get any bill through you settle for less than if you waited a little bit longer he said Although people attending the national pipeline conference here agree eithe r bill would be an improvement they are proposing several changes The pipeline reformers want to amend the two congressional bills in order to Broaden a states power so OPS could reject safety regulations and environmental protection programs only if they compromise safety Mandate use of leakdetection devices Require waterpressure testing of pipelines every five years Require use of failsafe pipeline devices that dont rely on comput ers or human intervention Upgrade safety management rules Create pipeline oversight committees made up of citizens and local elected officials Rick Kessler an aide to Rep John Dingell DMich long a champion of pipeline reform said the national pipeline coalition has provided an impetus never before seen in Washington DC Momentum for the bills wont wane if activists remain vigilant he said Dont stop pushing Kessler said Once you do therell be a void on one side There are people here fulltime paid to keep pushing on the other side Weimer said pipeline reformers need to come up with the cash to hire their own lobbyist to track pipeline happenings in the nations capital When we all go away we need someone here in DC to tell us whats going on he said The Associated Press contributed to this article

agreed that it would not be prudent for individual pipelines representatives to attend the coalition meetings Sunday Monday The tone of the meeting announcements made it clear that this grass roots group is not receptive towards receiving information on pipeline safety records Terry Boss of INGAA attended the meeting Included in the audience were the parents of the Bellinghamvictims and members of Safe Bellingham and the speeches were not surprisingly politica l in tone the inadequacy of OPS and the need for funds for state safety measures OPS should be restructured FERC should be restructured the EIS process is a joke Here are samples of some newspaper articles that INGAA forwarded Just because we didnt take an active role in the Coalition meeting doesnt mean we arent moving forward at developing our legislative Enron recommended INGAA strategy Dave Phil Jeff and I met on Monday Jeff reports that while pipeline oversight legislation is unlikely this year we will absolutely have to deal with the appropriations issue added user fees Jeff is outlining a compromise position that he thinks could be politically feasible something along the lines that we can live with add ed user fees directed towards one call and public education programs Well g et this outline out shortly I want to get it in Bob Hills hands before the INGAA Board meeting Pipeline officials hear hard questions SUMMIT Parents of Wade King Stephen Tsiorvas speak to panel Stephen Power The Bellingham Herald WASHINGTON DC The nations top pipeline regulator and a White House environmental aide came under sharp questioning Monday when the parents of two children killed in a Bellingham pipeline blast confronted them at a conference of safety activists With more than four dozen audience members watching one of the parents Frank King handed a picture of his yearold son Wade to White House aide Gabrielle Tenzer and asked her to deliver it to President Clinton Ask him what he would have done if Chelsea had been standing by that creek King said referring to Whatcom Creek where his son was playing last June when the explosion occurred in the pipeline of Olympic Pipe Line Co Another parent Katherine Dalen drew applause when she stood and told federal pipeline regulator Richard Felder that the concept of safety means something different to me than it does to you She later handed Tenzer a funeral program with the picture of her yearold son Stephen Tsiorvas who died along with Wade and yearold Liam Wood The tense exchanges occurred on the second day of the National Pipeline Safety Reform Conference a gathering of environmentalists local governmen t leaders and citizens who want tougher regulations on underground fuel pipelines Administration officials who attended the conference Monday Tenzer Felder and Assistant Attorney General Lois Schiffer outlined their efforts to prevent pipeline accidents and told participants that the federal Transportation Department planned to propose safety reforms But audience members chortled at some of the panelists remarks and expressed frustration with the performance of the US Office of Pipeline Safety the federal agency that regulates the nations pipelines Were really chagrined that there was no one here from the administration the past two days taking notes said Susan Harper executive director of Cascade Columbia Alliance a Seattle group that helped block Olympic Pipe Lines proposed crossCascades fuel pipeline in Washington last year Tha t was a big oversight on your part As part of the US Transportation Department the Office of Pipeline Safet y regulates more than miles of hazardous liquid lines and more than million miles of natural gas lines throughout the country But with on ly inspectors to cover more than million miles of pipe nationwide criti cs have questioned the agencys effectiveness The agency has also drawn attention for sharply limiting the role states ca n play in policing interstate pipelines a trend that delights oil and gas interests but worries some local governments Felder said his agency has allowed Olympic Pipe Line to continue operating because the company has performed appropriate testing of its lines But h e acknowledged the agency wouldnt know the cause of the Bellingham accident until the National Transportation Safety Board completes its probe The boards investigation has stalled in recent months because some Olympic employees have refused to cooperate fearing their testimony could be used by prosecutors in a potential criminal case Wed also like to know more about how the Bellingham accident occurred In the end we will have some of these answers said Felder who is th e pipeline offices associate administrator But he said the less information we have the more cautious we are and the more conservative we are Felders comments drew an angry response from Frank King who waved a newspaper clipping about a daycare center in his state that was shut down immediately when a child in its custody died of undetermined causes I find it outrageous King said This is the only time Ive ever seen where one person is allowed to continue operating after murdering three children Felder said he is encouraging states to focus on intrastate lines such as natural gas lines that heat homes The vast majority of pipeline accidents about percent involve such intrastate systems according to federal records He also said most accidents occur as a result of third parties such as construction crews that dig without checking for fuel lines Were very interested in state input he said But youve got to look at where the risks are They arent in the big lines Theyre in the small lines Tenzer did not respond directly to King when he approached her but told a reporter afterward that she would make sure Clinton received the picture She declined to answer when a reporter asked her for the White Houses vie w of the Office of Pipeline Safetys performance Reach Stephen Power at or call Pipeline Reform Summit in Washington DC Industry lobbyist takes notes for OPS GOVERNMENT Official shrugs off potential conflict of interest Khurram Saeed The Bellingham Herald WASHINGTON DC Just when it looked like it couldnt get any worse for the federal Office of Pipeline Safety it did The head of OPS told a reporter Monday that a lobbyist for a natural gas association had been taking notes about pipeline safety reform on OPS behalf for the past two days at a national pipeline conference OPS the agency responsible for overseeing the nations interstate pipelines has been at the center of fierce criticism by pipeline activist s over the years for being too close to the fuel industry That cozy relationship has put corporate profits above public safety pipeline reformers contend Some conference speakers laughed out loud and shook their heads in disbelie f when told that Richard Felder was relying on the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America for information about the conference Its perfect said Virginia attorney Jim Pates an outspoken and longtime critic of OPS It reflects not only the closeness of the relationship but the insensitivity of how it appears to the public Felder dismissed any potential for conflict of interest even though his agency monitors companies that belong to the gas association He said he knew half of the people in the room and was familiar with their concern s thus the notes wouldnt tell him something he didnt already know Im not worried about getting the issues because theres a roomful of people wholl send them to me Felder said after speaking at the conference Earlier in the day several speakers publicly questioned why OPS hadnt sen t a representative such as a note taker or public relations person to the meeting that covered such topics as improving pipeline safety standards protecting whistleblowers and granting more authority to local governments Its a professional organization that should be listening to us said Susan Harper head of a Puget Sound environmental group that fought Olympi c Pipe Line Cos proposed Cascade pipeline Whether they like us or not they should be here Terry Boss vice president of safety and operations for the natural gas association said he was taking notes on his organizations behalf and offered to share them with OPS Im just doing a favor Boss said Would it be better for OPS to have someone here or for OPS not to have someone here Frank King whose yearold son was killed in last Junes Bellingham pipeline explosion said it was ironic that officials from the agency that needs to learn about pipeline safety the most werent there in person for the twoday conference Their arrogance is evident everywhere we go he said Its perfect It reflects not only the closeness of the relationship but the insensitivity of how it appears to the public Chances dim this year for pipeline laws POLITICS Keep pushing pipeline activists at conference are told Khurram Saeed The Bellingham Herald WASHINGTON DC Two congressional bills seeking to reform the nations pipeline industry might not become law until next year two Washington sta te pipeline reformers said Monday In itself the announcement wasnt all that surprising given that change comes slowly here particularly for industries with powerful connections and lots of money to spend on lobbying What was unexpected was the concession from pipeline reformers who have stated in the past that the current political climate an election year with lingering shockwaves from the Bellingham tragedy and pending reauthorization of the federal Office of Pipeline Safety was ideal for immediate change Two proposed laws Senate Bill introduced by Sen Patty Murray DWash and House Bill brought forward by Rep Jack Metcalf RLangl ey would impose strict standards on pipeline operators Both bills are sti ll in committee The committee chair must support the bill to send it for a full vote That s not likely to happen this session considering there are bills ahead of Murrays bill in the Senate Commerce Committee And Metcalf said he is having a hard time getting colleagues interested in buried pipelines The phrase out of sight out of mind certainly applies when pipelines are concerned he told conference attendees in a speech Even if we dont get a bill out this year we need to keep working on this said Carl Weimer executive director of SAFE Bellingham a local pipeline activist group that has gained national stature David Bricklin the Seattle attorney who has represented several cities including Bellingham against Olympic Pipe Line Co said the delay could b e a blessing in disguise Sometimes in a rush to get any bill through you settle for less than if you waited a little bit longer he said Although people attending the national pipeline conference here agree eithe r bill would be an improvement they are proposing several changes The pipeline reformers want to amend the two congressional bills in order to Broaden a states power so OPS could reject safety regulations and environmental protection programs only if they compromise safety Mandate use of leakdetection devices Require waterpressure testing of pipelines every five years Require use of failsafe pipeline devices that dont rely on comput ers or human intervention Upgrade safety management rules Create pipeline oversight committees made up of citizens and local elected officials Rick Kessler an aide to Rep John Dingell DMich long a champion of pipeline reform said the national pipeline coalition has provided an impetus never before seen in Washington DC Momentum for the bills wont wane if activists remain vigilant he said Dont stop pushing Kessler said Once you do therell be a void on one side There are people here fulltime paid to keep pushing on the other side Weimer said pipeline reformers need to come up with the cash to hire their own lobbyist to track pipeline happenings in the nations capital When we all go away we need someone here in DC to tell us whats going on he said The Associated Press contributed to this article

and the CEO is gone What went wrong by Mimi Swartz magissuesauthorsmimiswartzphp THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTONS DOWNTOWN feels like th e international headquarters of the best and the brightest The lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the oldfashioned oil c ompanies like Shell and Texaco nearby Enron in contrast throbs with mod ernity The people

of the tech industrythe guys wear khakis polo shirts and Banana Repu blic buttondowns Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin g intently like winners Enron is nothing if not energetic A Big Brother size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva tors while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe ople entering from the garage A sculpture of the corporate symbol an E ti pped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi s a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe inated Multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratula ting Enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between e levator banks declares Enrons simple if grandiose goal From the Worlds Leading Energy Company to The Worlds Leading Company For a while that future seemed guaranteed as Enron transformed itself fro m a stodgy troubled pipeline company in to a trading colossus in It was a Wall Street darling with a stock price that increased per cent in that sixteenyear period with revenues that increased from bil lion to billion The very mention of the company in energy circles th roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a report from Global Change Associates a firm that provides ma rket intelligence to the energy business This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling a visionary determine d to transform American business Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b y thenCEO Ken Lay Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers Instead it evolved into a co mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water If you had a risky drilling venture E nron would fund it for a piece of the action If you wanted your megacorpor ations energy needs analyzed and streamlined Enron could do the job If y ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs Enron was there to build and build Basically if an idea was new and potentiallyand fantasticallylucrative Enron wanted the first cra ck And with each success Enron became ever more certain of its destiny T he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the hightech wo rld and in February of this year Skilling reaped his reward when he succe eded Lay as chief executive officer Enron says Skilling was a great mar riage of the risktaking mentality of the oil patch with the risktaking me ntality of the financial markets The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en d of the twentieth century Like the hightech companies it emulated Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and in turn the Americ an economy Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but t he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacentthose wh o could see the future versus those who could not The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital With the best and the brightest a company couldnt possibly go wrong Or could it Today Enrons stock trades at around down from a high of in January The press cast Enron as the archvillain of Californias ene rgy crisis last spring and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market A longtroubled power plant pro ject in India threatened the companys global ambitions Telecommunications in which Enron was heavily invested imploded Wall Street analysts who o nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices Some of the cha nge in Enrons fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer tain times that has afflicted all of American business But the culture tha t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame ENRON JEFF SKILLING SAYS HAD a totally different way of thinking about b usinesswe got it At Enron in fact you either got it or you were gone it was as simple as black and white It is not coincidental then that th e color scheme of Skillings River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed Here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahoga ny floors Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets Billowy sofas set off the jetblack baby grand In the entry white orchids cascade from a b lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white mar ble There is only one offcolor note After almost twenty years Jeff Skil ling is no longer associated with Enron having resigned abruptly after jus t six months as CEO Once Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch Gene ral Electrics masterful CEO as one of Worth magazines best CEOs in Ame rica anointed in and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc hained adventure junkets in which a friend told BusinessWeek someone cou ld actually get killed Today he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr istmas morning I had no idea what Id let go of Skilling says of all th e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron From a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons Skilling clarifies The demands o f working for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances Divorc ed he lived in a squarefoot house without a microwave or a dishwash er He almost missed his brothers wedding Learning a foreign languageI never learned a foreign language he exclaims He never once took his youn gest son to school Im interested in the kids You dont do kids in fifte enminute scheduling Travel You cant go to Africa for a week and get a nything out of it Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs Im not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEOs job he says finally Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it s pragmatic edge It would have been easy to stay he says But that wou ld not have been good for me Hes a smallish ruddyfaced man who keeps himself at fighting weight hand some in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assi duously stolid gaze But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dullwitted utility company executives is now targeted at r eporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time His shrug stretches the lim its of his shimmering blue buttondown and his matching blue eyes look put upon Im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understa nding this PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni neties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfo lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building From nine t o five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the prist ine silver skyscraper to smoke They perched on the chrome banisters or lur ked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad They always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed Whatever people knew about Enron in tho se days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with th at scene Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past What macho engineer would have put up with s uch humiliation But this company was a child of another time that period in the mideighti es when chaos enveloped the gas business Federal deregulation of natural g as turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies freque ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a v olatile freeforall The situation was compounded five years later by fede ral deregulation of the pipeline business So it happened that a gentlemanl y gas pipeline company Houston Natural Gas HNG found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation Oscar Wyatts less than gentlemanly firm HNG wa s then run by Lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and Transc o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy His doc toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V ietnam War Lay who was from Missouri and never succumbedat least outwar dlyto Texas brashness had done well enough Thanks to canny expansions H NGs pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat e of Texas HNG fended off Coastal but to protect the company from other takeover atte mpts Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth one of the largest pipeline companies i n the country at the time Then a funny thing happened HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to comea lot like Coastal What the Nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being call ed the merger back in Houston and before long following some particular ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston the companys center of gr avity started shifting toward Texas and shortly after that Ken Lay was ru nning a new company called Enron Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with Enron at tha t time He never fought change He embraced change Lay had won but what exactly did that mean Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines Without new ideasfor that matter a whole new business planthe company could be finished before it really even got s tarted LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES Jeff Skilling ha d spent a lot of time in the Midwest and he was selfmadeat fourteen he h ad been the chief production director at a startup TV station in Aurora I llinois His mother would drop him off there every day after school I l iked being successful when I was working and I was smart he told Busines sWeek earlier this year But unlike many of his Enron colleagues Skilling wasnt deliberate and softspoken and happy to go home at five oclock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than w hat he would come to call intellectual capital He loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people He graduated from Southern Meth odist University went into bankingassets and liability managementand too k on Harvard Business School where he graduated in the top percent of hi s class Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped up path to American success He joined Manhattans McKinsey and Company as a business consultant and that is where Ken Lay found him in It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked While everyone else was worr ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he al one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses And so in a world w here credit was nearly impossible to come by Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers Enron would not be a broker but a banker It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved And Enron would make money on transactions much like an inv estment bank would Skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling The n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about Enron exec utives He had a onepage presentation Almost to a person Skilling says they thought it was stupid Almost After Skilling left the meeting dej ected he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized Lay listened and th en said Lets go The Gas Bank was not an overnight success For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze ns of colleagues who had assisted him In fact he had come upon one of tho se divides that seem to define his life I believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way Skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right Fairly soon after launching the company sold million worth of gas in a week True to Skillings character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new He says the joke around Enron was that if a companys CEO was under fifty We were in And he was in too In Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation a new division created just fo r him In that company closed a deal that earned million in profit After that says Skilling we never looked back Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldnt work unless it ha d a trading component Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w ould make the project go But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin ate it The company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the b est access to supplies That in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play With so many customers in its pocket Enron could b etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m ake trades for its own benefitEnron could in effect bet on which way the p rice of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but wi th startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m ade He created within Enron a new culture to match its new trading busin ess The idea was to build a knowledgebased business which demanded a s kill set not exactly prized by Enrons employees from the old HNG days Mos t were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most o f them men of coursethe kind of people youd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government But now the company needed b older people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make moneylots of moneyfor themselves and for the company Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains The peo ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had na rrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people He wanted the s martest people from schools like Harvard Stanford and maybe Rice And be cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big gest and best investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B oston In addition to being smart Enron people were also supposed to be a ggressive You were right for Enron if you didnt want to wait until you w ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization You could see what he was looking for on Super Saturdays at the Houston h eadquarters eight fiftyminute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee nthe company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day They were scored from to on their smarts their problemsolving a bility their passion for hard work and what at Enron was called a sense of urgency People who scored less than were scratched The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired These were t he types that automatically turned down the companys first offer knowing Enron would come back with more The starting salary was around Ma ybe it wasnt a fortuneyetbut the signing bonus about was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof ts being renovated close to downtown Enron people didnt live in farflun g suburbs Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office For the lucky winners Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifteda ndtalented program New associates learned the latest techniques for struc turing energy deals and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g lobe The hours were long but every possible need was taken care of A com pany concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning th e house planning a vacation Of course a lot of people who worked for Enr on never got to take vacationsthey were too busy making moneybut they cou ld use the company gym and the companys personal trainers If they were ov erweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join Enrons Wellness Progra m Massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until t en at night They were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time They really thought about th e psychology and what it took to keep these people going Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firmsanalysts associates directors and managing directorsbut everyone knew that thos e titles didnt really matter Money did Instead of competitive salaries a nd decent bonuses Enron offered competitive salaries and meritbased bonus eswith no cap If you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says Ken Rice who stayed with Enron for years un til resigning recently as the head of the companys faltering broadband div ision Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a million bonus And the more you produced the closer you got to Jeff Real hot dogs join ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia Land Cruiser racing in Australia or of froad motorcycling in a recreation of the Baja race ending at a sp ectacular Mexican villa Every time hed speak Id believe everything he d say one loyalist says And why not By Enron had become North Americas largest naturalgas m erchant controlling percent of the market But at a company where the b uzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop Skilling and Lay belie ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv ice at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for Enron they bega n barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power compa ny presidents who with their multimilliondollar salaries and monopoly se rvice areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who wer e somewhat more receptive thanks in part to Enrons generous lobbying effo rts But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling In Ken Lay m ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company By then the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity The divisio n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from billion to billion Mr Skillings experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the New York Times noted Everyone would certainly have thought so Enron and Skill ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran sforming another FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within sang the New York Times in In the staid world of regulated utilitie s and energy companies Enron Corp is that gatecrashing Elvis crowed For tune in Wall Street was demanding techsize growth on a tech timetabl e and Enron in obliged with second quarter earnings of million up percent from the previous year That year the company seemed to dis cover a market a minute Under Skilling Enron was trading coal paper ste el and even weather No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client People drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedg e against the usual winter downturn But most exciting to the financial world was Enrons entry into hightech c ommunications Because of the companys marketing dominance EnronOnline be came another overnight success handling billion in commodity trades o nline in Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi d price and the asking price Then there was the broadband business To Enr on trading excess capacity in large highspeed fiberoptic networks empt y lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from tradi ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines So Enron created a market for wha t the industry calls bandwidth Soon after it also announced a twentyyear deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes Enron looked like a company that couldnt lose Its strat egy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commo dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market BusinessWeek insis ted There was however another reason Enron did so well in such a short time the companys hardnosed approach toward its customers The old notion of c ustomer service was based on the long haulyou had to nurse and coddle cust omers to keep them But Enron had new markets and new ideascustomers had t o come to it Over time the company stopping referring to its business cli ents as customers and began calling them counterparties Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable Gains were m aximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated So if you wanted to launch a highrisk ventur e quicklysuch as Zilkha Energys new hightech approach to drilling for oi lyou got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un derwrite the project if it ever would But because Enron invented its mark ets and subsequently dominated them Enron could set the terms of its deals from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene d at all While many businesses used what was known in the industry as marktomarke t accounting for instance Enron used it on an unprecedented scale The c ompany priced their deals at current market valuebut it was always Enrons idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt ge t deals And while oldfashioned companies spread their profits out like an nuities over a period of years Enron took most of its profit upfront How ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year If a few analysts thought there mig ht be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting inves tors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in As the mark et fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a projec t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent going to be high enough Enron is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee Winning the highest possible profits for the comp any could even extend to Enrons attitude toward charity When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission a literacy group called on Enron for a c ontribution it was suggested that he start raising money for Enrons compe ting literacy charity Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron he says As Enron became more and more successful the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side The competition turned inward As one member of the En ron family put it It became a company full of mercenaries The change st arted at the bottom As Enrons domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away New associates were treated much like t he commodities the company traded Global Changes Enron spies reported ove rhearing orders like I need a smart persongo buy me one or Buy me an in telligent slave quick Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl e sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on selfpa rody A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months It was to o disruptive People couldnt get their work done And of course Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension The Performance Review Committee which had initially been installed by S killing in the Capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking s ystem in the country Employees were rated on a scale of one to five and t hose with fives were usually gone within six months The PRCs nickname qu ickly became rank and yank It was a point of pride that Skillings divi sion replaced percent of its workforce every year As one Skilling assoc iate put it Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store Skillings approach to businessget in and get outhad become Enro ns attitude toward its workers In time it would become many workers att itude toward the company Teamwork never that valuable in a trading cultur e went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus If protocol required an Enr on higherup to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World he might helpor he might not depending on whether another potentially m ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s ight of the future says one former employee Anyone who couldnt close de als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores as were the higheru ps who had backed them Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase No old tapes became a n Enron clich People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former Enron executive In such a hothouse paranoia flowered New contracts contained highly restr ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company Email was monitored A former executive routinely carried two laptops on e for the company and one for himself People may have been rich at Enron but they werent necessarily happy One recruiter described the culture thi s way They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y ou bleed to death BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the worlds leading energy company into the worlds leading company he had to make one more change J ust as he had done ten years before Skilling had to purge the company of i ts remaining old order Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea lt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who d ealt with intangible assets Pipelines power plantsthey may have been Enr ons pride but Skilling wanted them gone Expensive longterm building pr ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm ous returns on investment capital and Skilling knew it It wasnt the tim e for longterm approaches an Enron executive says of Wall Streets mood It was the technology era To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past Skilling had to take on Rebe cca Mark long considered his rival for the CEOs job Mark was for many ye ars the poster child for the Enron way Young attractive aggressiveher n ickname was Mark the Sharkshe came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th e requisite Harvard MBA Mark was largely responsible for the success of En ron International the assetheavy side of the company where she developed billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for percent o f Enrons profits in For this she reaped breathtaking compensationon e Enron executive estimated millionand adoring press clips including two appearances on Fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo rate America But then Mark ran into trouble with a gasfired power plant in Dabhol Indi a one of the largest ever constructed She had played the game the Enron w ay Taking Enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes p ercent instead of the usual and hung in through lawsuits and three c hanges in government But the time and expense needed to make India and oth er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enrons goals and Skillings impatience with Mark grew Forcing Mark out however was no easy matter Key executives left divisio ns were dismantled but she remained The truth was Enron didnt mind firin g lowerlevel employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relen tless people it tended to promote The company preferred humiliationkeepin g a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title One particularly d ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis A company a s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a publicrelations disa ster So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar k her own company Despite Skillings contempt for assetheavy businesses Enron spent more than billion to buy a runofthemill British water uti lity that could serve as Enrons entry into the emerging world of water pri vatization Mark was put in charge of making Enron yes the worlds greate st water company Azurix as the new business was called looked like anoth er sure thing Its IPO in raised million But Mark had to succeed on Enrons increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities Water is not li ke gas or electricityowners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money The company stumbled layoffs commenced an d confidence evaporated By August the stock price which had started out at had fallen to Marks resignation followed and Azurix much diminished was folded into Enron I think its best for Rebecca to start afresh Lay who had been a mentor to Mark told the Wall Street Journal Or as one critic put it They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business As drew to a close Skilling was in total command In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable The best time for the succession to occur is wh en the company is doing well he told the press Enron is doing extremely well now In February Jeff Skilling took over the CEOs job ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED Enrons domination of the electric power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac le Both PBSs Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron portraying t he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington L ay and Enrons political action committee are the top contributors to Georg e W Bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo od or electricity Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the companys jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif ornia as both tried to buy power online The Times reported that Lay had t ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d eregulation The bad press was to say the least ironic Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence Wall Street was discovering its we aknesses By late March the stock price had slid to a share from in January Within Enron the assetbased divisions took the rap for the decline The India plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within Enrons management team But the California situa tion was more visible and therefore more damaging despite Enrons claim th at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us says Mark Palmer a vice president for corpo rate communications We were a Texas company There was a Texan in the Whi te House California was a state that didnt put him in office and his big gest contributor was a Texas energy company Performance is going to take c are of our stock price The truth will take care of Gray Davis Californi a utilities still owe Enron million another reason stockholders might be panicky But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skillings al l too apparent lack of contrition Facing down his critics he cracked a jo ke comparing California with the Titanic At least the Titanic went down with its lights on But the biggest problem was Enrons telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize highspeed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiberoptic cable would grow from billi on in to billion by but then the tech bubble burst So too d id the muchhyped moviesondemand deal with Blockbuster For the first tim e in its confoundingly successful life Enron had nothing new to take to ma rket Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enrons most important cheerleaders t he stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant D uring the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who chal lenged Enrons financial reporting an asshole When the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profit s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse ts Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enrons accounting Skilling pr omised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner Th ere wasnt any positive news Carol Coale of Prudential Financial says n ow Basically he talked me out of a downgrade The business press so generous in the past turned surly Fortune had aske d in March whether Enron was overpriced Start with a pretty straightforw ard question How exactly does Enron make its money The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray ed in the media as a fire sale Skilling had sold million worth Ken L ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount Then the Wall Street Jour nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with in the company It was essentially risk management against Enrons possibl e failures Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th e stock price By late August it had fallen below Enron so institutio nally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine When Wall Stre et is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting says Carol Coale When a company falls out of favor all these issues ca rry more weight This fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started e xperiencing an attack of conscience Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th eir ways It just created an attitude one executive still at Enron says If senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard Th ere was a real culture of Were above everyone else Loyalty had never been prized at Enron so there was no reason to expect it now An oldfashioned slowmoving company like Exxon could demand hardshi p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road But as one Houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit h someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporati on thats better suited for good times than bad As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too As the sto ck price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration Then after a trip to visit the families of three employe es killed at a plant in England he had an epiphany Life was short for hi m Enron was over Ever stoic Ken Lay returned to the CEOs office named a new president arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler Enron in the future Trading anything and everything was out The company Lay says will still innovate but innovat e much closer to our core As for the culture Things like the Performanc e Review Committee I think we could have applied better By trying to cate gorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a mo rale problem That Skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence Despite Skillings lengthy tenure wi th Enron hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always belie ved in cutting losses and moving on But now that he was abandoning them wh en the company was in trouble it was different Even Jeffs biggest detra ctors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back Look he s ays with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron Were my int erests aligned with the shareholders Absolutely Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims elf back into the world of ideas His eyes flash as he talks about new tech nologies The first wave never gets it right he says The standalone d otcoms didnt work but the technological applications will create a secon d wave that will change the world Houston he promises will become the w orlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it In f act he is already shopping for office space This is the second wave and Enrons got it he says almost breathless There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g et it

Inc All Rights Reserved Enrons Bonds Tell the Tale Stay Away By Herb Greenberg mailto Senior Columnist RealMoneycom PM EDT URL prmoneyherbonthestreetrmhtml Updated from pm EDT If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap check out its bonds Bond analysts almost always know best because theyre looking at the guts of a company the ability of a company to service its debt If it cant service the debt stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid Which brings us to Enron ENENYSE news commentary The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple Low fellas is relative to reality Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because as he says accounting irregularities sell Good point Now lets back that up with the bond markets view which can be seen in the socalled swap spread which is bondtraderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper or swaps Its a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk Tuesday that spread on Enrons fiveyear notes was basis points or about percentage points Today its points or percentage points As one bond trader told me today anybody would be crazy to pay that much Another bond trader told another friend the same thing Why As of June Enron had cash of just million and debt of nearly billion And this observation Those fiveyear notes currently yield more than Thats a junkbond yield for what is still rated as an investmentgrade debt anything more than is considered ultrahigh risk So while you can make thats still not enough where the accounting is questionable one bond trader says Youre not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default You have to worry about your recovery value Not the kind of riskreward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about billion with a capital B Speaking of bonds and stocks Even with its stock at about Global Crossing GXNYSE news commentary still has a market cap that exceeds billion But while its stock

commentary with a market cap of million and debt that trades at cents Where are opportunistic bond investors who should be hopping on such cheap debt especially bank debt which is at the top of the gettingpaidback food chain Theyre nowhere to be seen for the same reasons theyre not jumping to buy Enrons bonds Too much risk because when companies like those go bad their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading Try telling that to hopespringseternal stock investors Providian pratfalls Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared The item noted how institutional bond investors who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy socalled credit defaultprotection insurance couldnt find any at any price for Providian PVNNYSE news commentary The insurance is sold by investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade If nobodyll take the other side of the trade or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so investors should beware Which brings us back to Enron It is possible to buy credit insurance but at more than a whopping basis points over LIBOR Hardly a vote of confidence Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on Enron By James J Cramer mailto RealMoneycom AM EDT URL prmoneyjamesjcramerhtml Accounting irregularities sell Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine always in view They have never let me down When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant CDNYSE news commentary initially or when because of my fourmonth holding period I couldnt sell Qwest QNYSE news commentary Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron ENENYSE news commentary telling you to sell it The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is I still cant see why you have to tempt fate and own this one The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound that it has a great core business is just hokum Who the heck knows Who has any idea of what this company can really earn Who knows what it did earn All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron noted Republicangiving company for alleged fraud When that happens when that shoe drops wherever Enron is then maybe it is worth some scrutiny But I bet I still wont like it Enrons Excuses Sound Familiar By James J Cramer mailto RealMoneycom PM EDT URL prmoneyjamesjcramerhtml If you disclose something that is wrong and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed is it therefore right Thats what Enron ENENYSE news commentary is asking us to believe By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals they have simply compounded the error Next they will tell us that Janus the largest shareholder knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises What they are doing at Enron is well positively here we go s In the s you had all of these savingsandloan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher Nope What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble The government ended up going after them too for abetting the travesties Enron didnt use taxpayers money so it is arguably not as clearcut But the more we probe this Enron the more we check it out the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didnt leave because the stock got hammered or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish but because of this nasty unseemly situation We dont want an SEC probe here We want a Justice Department probe This isnt about unclear disclosure This could end up being about fraud In the meantime I wouldnt touch this stock with a foot pole This ones gonna get real nasty before it gets nice If it ever does FOOL ON THE HILL Enrons Disdain for Investors The Motley Foolcom While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFOs past partnerships a smaller and more obvious omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarters conference call and press release something we dont like but is prevalent it also doesnt release its balance sheet The company must think were idiots Theyre wrong By Tom Jacobs Aboutstafftomjhtm TMF Tom October Enrons NYSE ENE uberdataaspsymbolsENE troubles just dont stop On Monday the company announced corppressroomreleaseseneLJMfinalltrhtml that the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC had requested information on certain related party transactions specialsspehtm That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow There has been a flurry a hailstorm of financial media attention to this There are only three possibilities and none is palatable The companys board allowed this deal in order to using corporate speak incentivize the CFO and it was not legal It was legal but unethical or Enron has been less than forthcoming perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark The accounting machinations involve mindnumbing terms and obfuscation making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide The New York Times Floyd Norris calls them some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the companys SEC filings accounting texts my highspeed Web connection and some beer that of Shakespeares King Lear that way madness lies On the one hand I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting reading financial statements and finding trouble To read what this is all about check the Certain Transactions section of the companys latest proxy statement secsecaspdatecurrTickerenesymbolseneguidBDFDDDDBDFEDBDDFAFD I fully intend to do that someday For now though all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent Whats worse though is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials That really cheeses me off The quarterly call and press release parade Most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination that allegedly state their latest quarters numbers and talk about the business Sometimes when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure Specialssphtm Reg FD analysts dont get a secret call with the real numbers at another time than the public We like that Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers portfoliosrulemakerrulemakerhtm and EBITDA portfoliosrulemakerrulemakerhtm both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of bullfeathers It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic The PR department carefully dresses them with spin leaving the details for the fine print Headline Earnings up Revenues down Headline Revenues up Earnings down The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness newsfothfothhtm At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business but the financials are not helpful Why Hiding the cash flow statement Because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash right Well not quite You really need the cash flow statement the best measure of how the companys business actually performs Even then you may need to make further adjustments portfoliosrulemakerrulemakerhtm Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time Check the companies you own If they dont release cash flow statements with their earnings or at least prior to SEC filings you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so Encourage your fellow investors to do so too and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya They will maintain that the numbers arent ready at earnings time Tell them to wait until they are The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline and wouldnt we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture Or hey why not do two releases one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enrons only sin it wouldnt be that big a deal It has plenty of company But this preHalloween specialssphtm scary tale gets worse Unfortunately for Enron investors the company does the hidethecashflowstatement gig one better Hiding the balance sheet For at least the last three quarters that I checked Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time Thats right Not just the cash flow statement but the balance sheet too All they release is the income statement though in truth it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses But why fail to release the balance sheet The only conclusion can be that management doesnt want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people wont bother to read When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release Skilling reportedly called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners Off his meds that day Or a symptom of the companys attitude towards shareholders Looks like the latter Skillings gone but the practice hasnt changed Its about management We dont depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases A publicly traded companys financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes Data page No investor should be buying or holding stock in companies if they dont read their filings carefully Its hard enough to discern whats going on in a business without doing so and even in those filings such as with options grants to management the real meat is buried in footnotes Not reading Qs and Ks is like getting married without dating or buying a car by paint color only What Enrons failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are subpar It says management is willing to hold these events but itll be darned if itll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than managements spin In Enrons case its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change Does that make Enrons earnings releases circuses Draw your own conclusion Is management listening Perhaps It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday TMF community member emschulze took notes Messageaspmid On call analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given companys previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance response was that balance sheet doesnt normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in Q to be filed by Nov CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future implying that investors wont have to wait all the way until Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet Thats a good sign But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time Enron should be in the doghouse Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because todays income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together whats the problem Shareholders should demand no less When a company trumpets an income statement as Enron has no one should be surprised when smoke appears And perhaps much more Tom Jacobs TMF Tom would like to improve his own cash flow statement At press time he owned no shares of

like bonds Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve said Minow who said the service will be called Board Analyst Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site thecorporatelibrarycom Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year she said Only directors of US companies will initially be evaluated NonUS directors may be added later Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights They formerly managed the Washingtonbased shareholder activist Lens Fund which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buyside said industry spokespersons Theres been growing interest within our membership in board membership in general and individual directors in particular I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors said Ann Yerger spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors which represents Americas large pension funds The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors But examples of lax board oversight still abound One example would be Enron Corp whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the companys chief financial officer Minow said Where was the Enron board in all of this she asked Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these That apparently didnt happen here Taking the corporate governance argument a step further Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company This isnt just a corporate governance thing This is part of investment analysis she said Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks Whether they will begin to examine directors as well remained an open question Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction said Peter Gleason vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors which represents more than corporate directors Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank selfevaluation high on their list of concerns More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing Gleason said Copyright

High Guys Im a little no a lot concerned about this guy whos coming in Thursday Hes expecting to learn about the general operation of a big pipeline I havent set anything up for him with anyone from ENA because I cant see a fit with what he wants to see I dont know why Jim would have given them my name John Buchanan told me that his presentation was going to take no more than a hour and a half He didnt know if Lynn Blair had anything else scheduled Please tell me yall have some other contacts arranged Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Monday July PM To Huertas Alfredo Shapiro Richard Cc Cantrell Rebecca W Subject RE st Italian visitor Mauro Formaggio Alfredo I would think that it would be best to talk with Joe Hartsoe in our DC office Enrons PL chief FERC regulatory guy and either Becky Cantrell or Leslie Lawner from a shippers perspective Joe is in Houston every once in a while You may want to contact him directly Becky works from Houston Leslie has to come in from New Mexico Jim Original Message From Alfredo Huertasrubio Sent Tuesday July PM To Richard Shapiro Cc James D Steffes Subject st Italian visitor Mauro Formaggio Rick as I mentioned to you last week I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer The first one is Mauro Formaggio Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline despatching operation commercial scheduling of transmission nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities Please see this email below He has not yet decided the dates but he is aiming at last week of August for days I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this and I would coordinate Formaggios meeting Alfredo Im scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA in the month of August The aspects Im considering are how OBAs are organized and how they are applied the operation of hubs the balancing penalties the trading of capacity the general operation of a big pipeline the general operation of a state pipeline and of a LDC the operation of a shipper Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your american colleagues on any of these items In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader in Atlanta on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper on many pipelines and storages and to another major shipper and producer in Houston on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities as well as on the access practice A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework To my opinion Northern would be all right It should act as a model to what could also be arranged with time by big transmission operators in our country It could refer to the dispatching operation and to the commercial scheduling of transmission to the nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities If possible two days would be a proper duration I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person so there would be no need of formal presentations The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right In the past when I was in Snam I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa So I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system Last time was some years ago when I visited Transcanada in Calgary for a week focusing on nomination and balancing Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years there were EL Paso PGE Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me As for the period it would be in the second half of August because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do here in Milano Thank you and best regards Mauro Dear Alfredo Im finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte on TPA practice there Among of meetings Im going to arrange it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline Northern seems to me a good example Would you envisage it as a possible example for me I would discuss the organization of dispatching see the nomination and balancing operation the allocation of measurement and other major aspects of TPA implementation including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines for transmission and storage Im considering the end of August for such a visit Owing to the extent of the subjects maybe two days would be appropriate Thank you and best regards Mauro

Commission meeting yesterday chaired by Pat Wood consisted of discuss ions on FERCs Administrative Issues Strategic and Business Plan Priorities for the strategic plan for through were outlined yeste rday and include a promoting secure highquality environmentally responsi ble energy infrastructure with consistent policies b encouraging competit ive markets in lieu of traditional regulation c protection of marketscus tomers through fair market oversight and d efficiently running FERC In r eaching these goals FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impe diments to market investment encouraging use of new technology continuing to advance competitive markets addressing landowner safety and environme ntal concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as c ost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders Shortly Staff wil l be recommending a twelvemonth plan as part of the overall strategic plan Infrastructure Adequacy There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the US beginning in November in the West in December or early spring a meeting w ill be held in the northeast and later in for the Midwest and south T he intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion California Infrastructure Update Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for takeaway capaci ty was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity The Cali fornia Energy Commission released a report on September that agrees that more expansion in California is needed Constraint Study FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be completed by November Staff cited constraints in central New York state and California Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or recommendations It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the r esulting costs to consumers RTO FERC is imposing additional incentives to encourage the formation or join ing in RTOs The Midwest Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered a t a FERC meeting in October There will be a series of meetings in RTO wee k to focus on congestion management cost recovery marketing monitoring transmission planning reliability standards and transmission rights A NOP R is expected to be issued on market design and structure Marketing Affiliate NOPR RM The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both n atural gas pipelines and electric utilities Under the proposal transmissi on providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondis criminatory basis The rules would be codified in a new section of the reg ulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all ener gy affiliates The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusi on of Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs from the definition of ene rgy affiliates The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of th e rule to public utilities native load merchant functions Option A Status Quo the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merc hant function Option B The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and wou ld prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of th e utility After extensive discussion the NOPR was approved with additional langu age added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may no t be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties and the States Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the definition of energy affiliate and whether there are any energytype affi liates that would be exempt Staff responded that the emphasis is on broade ning the definition to include all energy affiliates and no energytype m arketing affiliates would be exempt except RTOs The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certai n information to all energy affiliates The rules do not directly govern energy affiliates but they govern the disclosure of information and the s eparation of transmission employees officers and directors from other busi nesses Under the

Subject RE Settlement Offer Heres what Id like to do on thiswell just take out the word interactive in describing the open season were proposing to use for operational capacity I think Staff will come back and ask for an interactive process but we can address that issue when and if we get to the next step Again this initial offer is mostly designed to simply get the process rolling and to flush Staff out on whether they are serious or not We wont start putting meaning into the very broad concepts in the outline unless Staff comes back with a serious interest in settling Thanks df Original

Maria Cc Rob Kilmer Subject RE Settlement Offer I think I need to clarify something I believe EOL can develop a format similar to our original IOS which would allow interactive bidding That is what we

Boland Meiburger ENRON Charlie Moore Robin Nuschler Porter Gregory J Pavlou Maria Cc Rob Kilmer Subject RE Settlement Offer But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual partys economics Or does FERC not see that as a driver values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage Original Message From Miller Mary Kay Sent Tuesday September AM To McCarty Danny Hartsoe Joe Fossum Drew Harris Steven Gallagher Boland Meiburger ENRON Charlie Moore Robin Nuschler Porter Gregory J Pavlou Maria Cc Rob Kilmer Subject RE Settlement Offer I agree it uses an interactive tool ie hottap but I feel what FERC wants is interactive bidding on the posted

Steven Gallagher Boland Meiburger ENRON Charlie Moore Robin Nuschler Porter Gregory J Pavlou Maria Miller Mary Kay Hartsoe Joe Cc Rob Kilmer McCarty Danny Subject RE Settlement Offer Steve do you see a problem with using EOL as the IOS process for the operational capacity deals I dont propose that we get into this level of detail with Staff at this time but if they like the overall proposal at some point well need to let them know that what we mean by IOS is the EOL process I dont see why wed have to design a new IOS from scratch if EOL works fine Is anyone nervous that the idea of using EOL as part of our capacity posting and sales process will make it harder to sell a settlement to the Indicated Shippers Original Message From Harris Steven Sent Monday September PM To Gallagher

because of uncertainties about the companys extremely complex financi al structure Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastowrelated dealings Worries and rumors about Enrons financial strength could be found in the s tock market yesterday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible death spiral in which increasing c redit concerns

Enron board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy The company said that Mr Fastow had taken a leave of absence but it also named his successor Jeffrey McMahon the head of Enrons

he was referring to a separate billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings document and were angered wh en they later learned about it On Tuesday when both Mr Fastow and Mr Lay discussed the company with ana lysts on the conference call neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr Fastow Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiry in declining to discuss the detai ls of the transactions The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year but Enrons disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n ot lead to reported losses but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement That is one of the issues the SEC whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company is expected t o address Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of f its balance sheet but left the company

Only directors of US companies will initially be evaluated NonUS directors may be added lat er Ms Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corpo rate governance and shareholder

there wou ld be interest in more information on individual directors said Ann Yerge r spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors which represents Americas large pension funds The corporate governance movement since i ts beginnings in the s has focused on making directors more accountabl e and responsible Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more

argued that effective board membership is more th an a theoretical question It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company This isnt just a corporate governance thing This is part of investment analysis she said Institu tional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stoc ks Whether they will begin to examine directors as

Enron Corp trying to halt a freefall in its stock pri ce and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street named a new chief financi al officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow who has been linked to tr ansactions now under investigation by government regulators The company which is the nations largest energy trader said Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon who has been running an Enron unit and is the companys former treasurer in a bid to restore credibility with investorsFastows departure follows the August resignation of chief executive Jeff Skilling who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after ju st six months on the job Wednesdays change came after Enrons stock fell to its lowest point in six years to cap off a billion p lunge in market value since the company announced a third quarter loss last week and wrote down shareholder equity by billion in a move related t o the questionable transactions Wall Streets anxieties about Enron sprea d to the

conflict of interest Wall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it of not being forthcoming about the matter a problem Enron chief executive Ken Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO he said in a statemen t McMahon who was treasurer from to before becoming chief exec utive officer of Enrons Industrial Markets group has a deep and thorough understanding of Enron and the confidence of the investment world Lay sa id The Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke u p about the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangemen ts made by Fastow The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it which led McMahon to ask for a job change Fastow has denied any wr ongdoing but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues bec ause of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company As recently as a year ago Enron had a stellar image as a cor porate innovator with a Midas touch Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a hightech money mac hine creating new Internetbased trading markets in a wide range of commodi ties But some of its new businesses faded a large investment in an India n power plant went sour the California power crises spooked investors and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation There also was grousing from investors that Enrons earnings statements h ad become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility Analysts said th e replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron but no t a panacea for its credibility problems The problems investors are havi ng with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnersh ip arrangements Changing the CFO by itself doesnt really address those co ncerns said Mike Heim at AG Edwards I dont think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships he said I still have a lot of questions Andre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastows departure was not unexpected but not that helpful Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that cle ars up

Houstonbased energy behemoth had everything mon ey power glitz smarts new ideas and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo st important company in the world Now its stock is down wall street is be arish and the CEO is gone What went wrong by Mimi Swartz magissuesauthorsmimiswartzphp THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTONS DOWNTOWN feels like th e international headquarters of the best and the brightest The lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the oldfashioned oil c ompanies like Shell and Texaco nearby Enron in contrast throbs with mod ernity The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white b rown Asian Middle Eastern European African as well as Americanborn T hey are young mostly under and dressed in the aggressively casual unif orm of the tech industrythe guys wear khakis polo shirts and Banana Repu blic buttondowns Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin g intently like winners Enron is nothing if not energetic A Big Brother size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva tors while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe ople entering from the garage A sculpture of the corporate symbol an E ti pped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi s a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe inated Multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratula ting Enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between e levator banks declares Enrons simple if grandiose goal From the Worlds Leading Energy Company to The Worlds Leading Company For a while that future seemed guaranteed as Enron transformed itself fro m a stodgy troubled pipeline company in to a trading colossus in It was a Wall Street darling with a stock price that increased per cent in that sixteenyear period with revenues that increased from bil lion to billion The very mention of the company in energy circles th roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a report from Global Change Associates a firm that provides ma rket intelligence to the energy business This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling a visionary determine d to transform American business Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b y thenCEO Ken Lay Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers Instead it evolved into a co mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water If you had a risky drilling venture E nron would fund it for a piece of the action If you wanted your megacorpor ations energy needs analyzed and streamlined Enron could do the job If y ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs Enron was there to build and build Basically if an idea was new and potentiallyand fantasticallylucrative Enron wanted the first cra ck And with each success Enron became ever more certain of its destiny T he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the hightech wo rld and in February of this year Skilling reaped his reward when he succe eded Lay as chief executive officer Enron says Skilling was a great mar riage of the risktaking mentality of the oil patch with the risktaking me ntality of the financial markets The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en d of the twentieth century Like the hightech companies it emulated Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and in turn the Americ an economy Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but t he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacentthose wh o could see the future versus those who could not The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital With the best and the brightest a company couldnt possibly go wrong Or could it Today Enrons stock trades at around down from a high of in January The press cast Enron as the archvillain of Californias ene rgy crisis last spring and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market A longtroubled power plant pro ject in India threatened the companys global ambitions Telecommunications in which Enron was heavily invested imploded Wall Street analysts who o nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices Some of the cha nge in Enrons fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer tain times that has afflicted all of American business But the culture tha t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame ENRON JEFF SKILLING SAYS HAD a totally different way of thinking about b usinesswe got it At Enron in fact you either got it or you were gone it was as simple as black and white It is not coincidental then that th e color scheme of Skillings River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed Here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahoga ny floors Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets Billowy sofas set off the jetblack baby grand In the entry white orchids cascade from a b lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white mar ble There is only one offcolor note After almost twenty years Jeff Skil ling is no longer associated with Enron having resigned abruptly after jus t six months as CEO Once Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch Gene ral Electrics masterful CEO as one of Worth magazines best CEOs in Ame rica anointed in and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc hained adventure junkets in which a friend told BusinessWeek someone cou ld actually get killed Today he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr istmas morning I had no idea what Id let go of Skilling says of all th e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron From a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons Skilling clarifies The demands o f working for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances Divorc ed he lived in a squarefoot house without a microwave or a dishwash er He almost missed his brothers wedding Learning a foreign languageI never learned a foreign language he exclaims He never once took his youn gest son to school Im interested in the kids You dont do kids in fifte enminute scheduling Travel You cant go to Africa for a week and get a nything out of it Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs Im not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEOs job he says finally Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it s pragmatic edge It would have been easy to stay he says But that wou ld not have been good for me Hes a smallish ruddyfaced man who keeps himself at fighting weight hand some in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assi duously stolid gaze But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dullwitted utility company executives is now targeted at r eporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time His shrug stretches the lim its of his shimmering blue buttondown and his matching blue eyes look put upon Im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understa nding this PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni neties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfo lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building From nine t o five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the prist ine silver skyscraper to smoke They perched on the chrome banisters or lur ked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad They always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed Whatever people knew about Enron in tho se days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with th at scene Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past What macho engineer would have put up with s uch humiliation But this company was a child of another time that period in the mideighti es when chaos enveloped the gas business Federal deregulation of natural g as turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies freque ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a v olatile freeforall The situation was compounded five years later by fede ral deregulation of the pipeline business So it happened that a gentlemanl y gas pipeline company Houston Natural Gas HNG found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation Oscar Wyatts less than gentlemanly firm HNG wa s then run by Lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and Transc o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy His doc toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V ietnam War Lay who was from Missouri and never succumbedat least outwar dlyto Texas brashness had done well enough Thanks to canny expansions H NGs pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat e of Texas HNG fended off Coastal but to protect the company from other takeover atte mpts Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth one of the largest pipeline companies i n the country at the time Then a funny thing happened HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to comea lot like Coastal What the Nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being call ed the merger back in Houston and before long following some particular ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston the companys center of gr avity started shifting toward Texas and shortly after that Ken Lay was ru nning a new company called Enron Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with Enron at tha t time He never fought change He embraced change Lay had won but what exactly did that mean Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines Without new ideasfor that matter a whole new business planthe company could be finished before it really even got s tarted LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES Jeff Skilling ha d spent a lot of time in the Midwest and he was selfmadeat fourteen he h ad been the chief production director at a startup TV station in Aurora I llinois His mother would drop him off there every day after school I l iked being successful when I was working and I was smart he told Busines sWeek earlier this year But unlike many of his Enron colleagues Skilling wasnt deliberate and softspoken and happy to go home at five oclock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than w hat he would come to call intellectual capital He loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people He graduated from Southern Meth odist University went into bankingassets and liability managementand too k on Harvard Business School where he graduated in the top percent of hi s class Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped up path to American success He joined Manhattans McKinsey and Company as a business consultant and that is where Ken Lay found him in It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked While everyone else was worr ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he al one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses And so in a world w here credit was nearly impossible to come by Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers Enron would not be a broker but a banker It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved And Enron would make money on transactions much like an inv estment bank would Skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling The n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about Enron exec utives He had a onepage presentation Almost to a person Skilling says they thought it was stupid Almost After Skilling left the meeting dej ected he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized Lay listened and th en said Lets go The Gas Bank was not an overnight success For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze ns of colleagues who had assisted him In fact he had come upon one of tho se divides that seem to define his life I believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way Skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right Fairly soon after launching the company sold million worth of gas in a week True to Skillings character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new He says the joke around Enron was that if a companys CEO was under fifty We were in And he was in too In Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation a new division created just fo r him In that company closed a deal that earned million in profit After that says Skilling we never looked back Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldnt work unless it ha d a trading component Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w ould make the project go But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin ate it The company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the b est access to supplies That in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play With so many customers in its pocket Enron could b etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m ake trades for its own benefitEnron could in effect bet on which way the p rice of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but wi th startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m ade He created within Enron a new culture to match its new trading busin ess The idea was to build a knowledgebased business which demanded a s kill set not exactly prized by Enrons employees from the old HNG days Mos t were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most o f them men of coursethe kind of people youd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government But now the company needed b older people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make moneylots of moneyfor themselves and for the company Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains The peo ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had na rrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people He wanted the s martest people from schools like Harvard Stanford and maybe Rice And be cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big gest and best investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B oston In addition to being smart Enron people were also supposed to be a ggressive You were right for Enron if you didnt want to wait until you w ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization You could see what he was looking for on Super Saturdays at the Houston h eadquarters eight fiftyminute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee nthe company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day They were scored from to on their smarts their problemsolving a bility their passion for hard work and what at Enron was called a sense of urgency People who scored less than were scratched The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired These were t he types that automatically turned down the companys first offer knowing Enron would come back with more The starting salary was around Ma ybe it wasnt a fortuneyetbut the signing bonus about was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof ts being renovated close to downtown Enron people didnt live in farflun g suburbs Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office For the lucky winners Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifteda ndtalented program New associates learned the latest techniques for struc turing energy deals and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g lobe The hours were long but every possible need was taken care of A com pany concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning th e house planning a vacation Of course a lot of people who worked for Enr on never got to take vacationsthey were too busy making moneybut they cou ld use the company gym and the companys personal trainers If they were ov erweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join Enrons Wellness Progra m Massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until t en at night They were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time They really thought about th e psychology and what it took to keep these people going Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firmsanalysts associates directors and managing directorsbut everyone knew that thos e titles didnt really matter Money did Instead of competitive salaries a nd decent bonuses Enron offered competitive salaries and meritbased bonus eswith no cap If you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says Ken Rice who stayed with Enron for years un til resigning recently as the head of the companys faltering broadband div ision Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a million bonus And the more you produced the closer you got to Jeff Real hot dogs join ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia Land Cruiser racing in Australia or of froad motorcycling in a recreation of the Baja race ending at a sp ectacular Mexican villa Every time hed speak Id believe everything he d say one loyalist says And why not By Enron had become North Americas largest naturalgas m erchant controlling percent of the market But at a company where the b uzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop Skilling and Lay belie ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv ice at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for Enron they bega n barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power compa ny presidents who with their multimilliondollar salaries and monopoly se rvice areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who wer e somewhat more receptive thanks in part to Enrons generous lobbying effo rts But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling In Ken Lay m ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company By then the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity The divisio n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from billion to billion Mr Skillings experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the New York Times noted Everyone would certainly have thought so Enron and Skill ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran sforming another FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within sang the New York Times in In the staid world of regulated utilitie s and energy companies Enron Corp is that gatecrashing Elvis crowed For tune in Wall Street was demanding techsize growth on a tech timetabl e and Enron in obliged with second quarter earnings of million up percent from the previous year That year the company seemed to dis cover a market a minute Under Skilling Enron was trading coal paper ste el and even weather No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client People drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedg e against the usual winter downturn But most exciting to the financial world was Enrons entry into hightech c ommunications Because of the companys marketing dominance EnronOnline be came another overnight success handling billion in commodity trades o nline in Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi d price and the asking price Then there was the broadband business To Enr on trading excess capacity in large highspeed fiberoptic networks empt y lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from tradi ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines So Enron created a market for wha t the industry calls bandwidth Soon after it also announced a twentyyear deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes Enron looked like a company that couldnt lose Its strat egy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commo dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market BusinessWeek insis ted There was however another reason Enron did so well in such a short time the companys hardnosed approach toward its customers The old notion of c ustomer service was based on the long haulyou had to nurse and coddle cust omers to keep them But Enron had new markets and new ideascustomers had t o come to it Over time the company stopping referring to its business cli ents as customers and began calling them counterparties Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable Gains were m aximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated So if you wanted to launch a highrisk ventur e quicklysuch as Zilkha Energys new hightech approach to drilling for oi lyou got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un derwrite the project if it ever would But because Enron invented its mark ets and subsequently dominated them Enron could set the terms of its deals from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene d at all While many businesses used what was known in the industry as marktomarke t accounting for instance Enron used it on an unprecedented scale The c ompany priced their deals at current market valuebut it was always Enrons idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt ge t deals And while oldfashioned companies spread their profits out like an nuities over a period of years Enron took most of its profit upfront How ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year If a few analysts thought there mig ht be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting inves tors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in As the mark et fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a projec t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent going to be high enough Enron is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee Winning the highest possible profits for the comp any could even extend to Enrons attitude toward charity When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission a literacy group called on Enron for a c ontribution it was suggested that he start raising money for Enrons compe ting literacy charity Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron he says As Enron became more and more successful the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side The competition turned inward As one member of the En ron family put it It became a company full of mercenaries The change st arted at the bottom As Enrons domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away New associates were treated much like t he commodities the company traded Global Changes Enron spies reported ove rhearing orders like I need a smart persongo buy me one or Buy me an in telligent slave quick Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl e sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on selfpa rody A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months It was to o disruptive People couldnt get their work done And of course Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension The Performance Review Committee which had initially been installed by S killing in the Capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking s ystem in the country Employees were rated on a scale of one to five and t hose with fives were usually gone within six months The PRCs nickname qu ickly became rank and yank It was a point of pride that Skillings divi sion replaced percent of its workforce every year As one Skilling assoc iate put it Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store Skillings approach to businessget in and get outhad become Enro ns attitude toward its workers In time it would become many workers att itude toward the company Teamwork never that valuable in a trading cultur e went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus If protocol required an Enr on higherup to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World he might helpor he might not depending on whether another potentially m ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s ight of the future says one former employee Anyone who couldnt close de als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores as were the higheru ps who had backed them Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase No old tapes became a n Enron clich People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former Enron executive In such a hothouse paranoia flowered New contracts contained highly restr ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company Email was monitored A former executive routinely carried two laptops on e for the company and one for himself People may have been rich at Enron but they werent necessarily happy One recruiter described the culture thi s way They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y ou bleed to death BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the worlds leading energy company into the worlds leading company he had to make one more change J ust as he had done ten years before Skilling had to purge the company of i ts remaining old order Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea lt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who d ealt with intangible assets Pipelines power plantsthey may have been Enr ons pride but Skilling wanted them gone Expensive longterm building pr ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm ous returns on investment capital and Skilling knew it It wasnt the tim e for longterm approaches an Enron executive says of Wall Streets mood It was the technology era To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past Skilling had to take on Rebe cca Mark long considered his rival for the CEOs job Mark was for many ye ars the poster child for the Enron way Young attractive aggressiveher n ickname was Mark the Sharkshe came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th e requisite Harvard MBA Mark was largely responsible for the success of En ron International the assetheavy side of the company where she developed billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for percent o f Enrons profits in For this she reaped breathtaking compensationon e Enron executive estimated millionand adoring press clips including two appearances on Fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo rate America But then Mark ran into trouble with a gasfired power plant in Dabhol Indi a one of the largest ever constructed She had played the game the Enron w ay Taking Enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes p ercent instead of the usual and hung in through lawsuits and three c hanges in government But the time and expense needed to make India and oth er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enrons goals and Skillings impatience with Mark grew Forcing Mark out however was no easy matter Key executives left divisio ns were dismantled but she remained The truth was Enron didnt mind firin g lowerlevel employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relen tless people it tended to promote The company preferred humiliationkeepin g a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title One particularly d ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis A company a s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a publicrelations disa ster So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar k her own company Despite Skillings contempt for assetheavy businesses Enron spent more than billion to buy a runofthemill British water uti lity that could serve as Enrons entry into the emerging world of water pri vatization Mark was put in charge of making Enron yes the worlds greate st water company Azurix as the new business was called looked like anoth er sure thing Its IPO in raised million But Mark had to succeed on Enrons increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities Water is not li ke gas or electricityowners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money The company stumbled layoffs commenced an d confidence evaporated By August the stock price which had started out at had fallen to Marks resignation followed and Azurix much diminished was folded into Enron I think its best for Rebecca to start afresh Lay who had been a mentor to Mark told the Wall Street Journal Or as one critic put it They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business As drew to a close Skilling was in total command In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable The best time for the succession to occur is wh en the company is doing well he told the press Enron is doing extremely well now In February Jeff Skilling took over the CEOs job ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED Enrons domination of the electric power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac le Both PBSs Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron portraying t he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington L ay and Enrons political action committee are the top contributors to Georg e W Bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo od or electricity Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the companys jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif ornia as both tried to buy power online The Times reported that Lay had t ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d eregulation The bad press was to say the least ironic Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence Wall Street was discovering its we aknesses By late March the stock price had slid to a share from in January Within Enron the assetbased divisions took the rap for the decline The India plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within Enrons management team But the California situa tion was more visible and therefore more damaging despite Enrons claim th at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us says Mark Palmer a vice president for corpo rate communications We were a Texas company There was a Texan in the Whi te House California was a state that didnt put him in office and his big gest contributor was a Texas energy company Performance is going to take c are of our stock price The truth will take care of Gray Davis Californi a utilities still owe Enron million another reason stockholders might be panicky But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skillings al l too apparent lack of contrition Facing down his critics he cracked a jo ke comparing California with the Titanic At least the Titanic went down with its lights on But the biggest problem was Enrons telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize highspeed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiberoptic cable would grow from billi on in to billion by but then the tech bubble burst So too d id the muchhyped moviesondemand deal with Blockbuster For the first tim e in its confoundingly successful life Enron had nothing new to take to ma rket Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enrons most important cheerleaders t he stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant D uring the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who chal lenged Enrons financial reporting an asshole When the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profit s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse ts Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enrons accounting Skilling pr omised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner Th ere wasnt any positive news Carol Coale of Prudential Financial says n ow Basically he talked me out of a downgrade The business press so generous in the past turned surly Fortune had aske d in March whether Enron was overpriced Start with a pretty straightforw ard question How exactly does Enron make its money The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray ed in the media as a fire sale Skilling had sold million worth Ken L ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount Then the Wall Street Jour nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with in the company It was essentially risk management against Enrons possibl e failures Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th e stock price By late August it had fallen below Enron so institutio nally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine When Wall Stre et is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting says Carol Coale When a company falls out of favor all these issues ca rry more weight This fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started e xperiencing an attack of conscience Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th eir ways It just created an attitude one executive still at Enron says If senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard Th ere was a real culture of Were above everyone else Loyalty had never been prized at Enron so there was no reason to expect it now An oldfashioned slowmoving company like Exxon could demand hardshi p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road But as one Houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit h someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporati on thats better suited for good times than bad As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too As the sto ck price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration Then after a trip to visit the families of three employe es killed at a plant in England he had an epiphany Life was short for hi m Enron was over Ever stoic Ken Lay returned to the CEOs office named a new president arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler Enron in the future Trading anything and everything was out The company Lay says will still innovate but innovat e much closer to our core As for the culture Things like the Performanc e Review Committee I think we could have applied better By trying to cate gorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a mo rale problem That Skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence Despite Skillings lengthy tenure wi th Enron hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always belie ved in cutting losses and moving on But now that he was abandoning them wh en the company was in trouble it was different Even Jeffs biggest detra ctors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back Look he s ays with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron Were my int erests aligned with the shareholders Absolutely Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims elf back into the world of ideas His eyes flash as he talks about new tech nologies The first wave never gets it right he says The standalone d otcoms didnt work but the technological applications will create a secon d wave that will change the world Houston he promises will become the w orlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it In f act he is already shopping for office space This is the second wave and Enrons got it he says almost breathless There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g et it

Morris Whelan Mr James G Whitehead Mr John P Willis Mr James S Wyatt Ms Karen L Ziegenfus Subject Closing of ENNEC Department Importance High Dear Alumns Im sorry to have to convey the bad news that the Penn State administration has decided to close the Department of Energy Environmental and Mineral Economics effective July This decision stems primarily from massive budget cuts confronting the University in light of a significant decrease in state appropriations and of a continuation of increasing costs of higher education Also despite acknowledged progress in Department accomplishments we are still lagging other EMS departments in major areas such as student credit hours and external funding Finally it is easier to close a small Department and one that is sometimes and erroneously viewed as duplicating educational efforts in the economics area than it is to close a larger and more unique department in the College Fortunately the University is formulating a plan with many positive aspects for our faculty staff students and with respect to coverage of our fields of expertise Tenured faculty will be shifting their appointments to other units in the College Meteorology Geography and elsewhere at Penn State Business Ag Econ The staff has been promised at least equivalent opportunities in EMS Continuing students will be provided the necessary courses over the next two years to graduate New educational initiatives in Environmental Risk Management and in Energy Business and new research initiatives associated with Penn States new Environmental Consortium will also serve to continue our intellectual tradition Still there is no way of getting around the news that a wonderful educational entity that has been home to so many wonderful people and has contributed so much to education the State of Pennsylvania and the larger world community will soon cease to exist Please know that our Department has worked valiantly for many years to amass accomplishments that would stave off such a decision As Head of the Department over the past fourteen years however I feel that I bear the ultimate responsibility for this outcome I only wish that I could have done more I regret that I have not kept in better touch with many of our alumns Recently and facilitated by the ease of using email we had planned to start a semiannual Alumni Newsletter The current situation actually makes this even more imperativethe Department may no longer exist but our Alumni Association can prosper indefinitely if we participate actively in it Let me encourage you to spread the word about our situation to alumns who have not received this communication and to ask them to send me their email addresses for future communications A degree from Penn States Mineral Economics Department or the revamped Department of Energy Environmental and Mineral Economics has served our alumns especially well over the past five decades There is no reason that it should not continue to do so Thanks

of ShortTerm Natural Docket No RM Gas Transportation Services Regulation of Interstate Natural Docket No RM Gas Transportation Services MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES Pursuant to the March Notice of Petition in the abovereferenced proceedings and Rules and of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions Commission regulations CFR and the Enron Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March Petition of the American Gas Association AGA Petition I All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to Shelley A Corman Vice President Government Affairs and Public Relations Enron Transportation Services Company Smith Street PO Box Houston TX Phone Email Nancy E Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager Government Affairs Washington DC Phone Email II MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act In some cases these pipelines are whollyowned subsidiaries in other cases Enron is a part owner These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party Thus the Enron Interstate Pipelines participation is in the public interest III COMMENTS The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein Like INGAA the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition First the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No proceedings or GISB compliance filings Second the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the farreaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates Rather than repeat those concerns again here we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights For the reasons set forth in both INGAAs response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition December To Gas Industry Standards Board From Pipeline Segment Re Business Practices Subcommittee Priority Action Items and and R At the scheduled December GISB Executive Committee meeting the agenda includes a discussion and vote on Recommendations and Proposed Standards This agenda item contains certain BPS proposals related to implementation of Order No requirements and related standards such as R Among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current GISB restrictions against partialday recalls Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the farreaching impact of flowing day recalls There are significant operational concerns with these standards We are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow particularly during critical periods We are concerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid The proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid Given these operational concerns we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards While we understand that this work is in response to R we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No Order No requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day Further most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability In the spirit of compromise we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases However under these revised standards all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported Nonetheless throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards In this area we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls it still preserves the application of the fullday contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers Flowing day recalls though are a separate issue Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems overruns imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards Any move from daily increments of service to partialday increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system including firm services interruptible services and balancing and operational provisions Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation April Mr David Boergers Secretary Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Office of the Secretary Room A East Washington D C Re Docket No RM Docket No RM Dear Mr

Message Date Tue Oct From Subject Re Accomodations in Kaz In adopta wrote A new thread on accomodations in Kazakhstan was proposed by one of our newer PAKK members Shes traveling soon and wondered what the options are for accomodations She specifically asked about the pros and cons of staying with a local host family versus renting an apartment or staying in a hotel If youve already traveled to Kaz please share your experiences with the list We stayed in a hotel during our stay in our sons adoption city and then had an apartment during our stay in Almaty We personally loved having an apartment it was our time with our son we were able to start being a family and doing family things playing cooking cleaning etc Our life began together immediately I think and I dont know since we didnt do this if you were with a host family it would put a different twist on the situation Not saying good or bad just different Kind of like when you visit someone and stay at their house vs renting a hotel room You can be more open when you are with your own family Best wishes on your adoption journey Cyndi Message Date Tue Oct From Subject Re Re HIV Testing and Russia I find all of this

a small apartment adjacent to their own apartment It was a wonderful way to get our new son used to family life as well as have Russian speakers nearby to ease the transition to living with Englishonly speakers The particular family we stayed with consisted of a grandmother retired schoolteacher who was there ALL the time Babushka cooked all our meals as well and she and I became close friends even though she spoke only Russian and I only English The father was an engineer by training but was currently doing much of the document running necessary for the adoptions processed by our facilitator The mother was an earnosethroat doctor and there were children year old boy who spoke wonderful English and acted as our translator for a fee of course and his year old sister I would encourage anyone who has the option of staying with a family to do so It helps to see how families live over there as well as observe first hand how food is served They eat the same sorts of food we see all the time here but serve it differently That knowledge alone was wonderful to have when our son first came back I fixed the food in the manner he was accustomed to seeing it served He now eats the way we do big plates and cooked in our way and hes been back since March this year Lynn McCarthy Nontext portions of this message have been removed Message Date Tue Oct GMT From Subject Taraz Hello Has anyone on this list adopted or in the process of adopting from Taraz I would really like some information about it Please feel free to respond privately if necessary Thanks Message Date Tue Oct From Stephen Smith Subject Hi Everyone The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities Of course thats cuz we havent had one here in a week But it is so typical for our kids to be set off by something that seems so simple and then they end up hating themselves I call it a hate fest and being self abusive Karly has told me during her tantrums that she is going to run away or kill herself and she hits herself too How Kaz of heryet her therapist says shes processing everything well and doesnt need to be seen every week But it still is a worry for the future Heres a question If the kids are tantrumming and abusing themselves doesnt that show guilt and self hatred Even though Kira doesnt feel bad about drinking the soda doesnt she feel bad for doing a wrong thing Is the problem that she doesnt feel bad for hurting and disappointing the family Is this just misplaced guilt Here is an idea and it is just an idea about the conscience thing The current behavioral theory with normal children is to discipline and consequence inappropriate behaviors without expressing anger so kids dont feel shame or guilt So would a way of teaching guilt include the parent sharing feelings of sadness and disappointment at the behaviorFor instance when Kira is calmed down or at a later time can you share your sadness that she lied to youCan you on a regular basis model different feelings it is totally hard for me NOT to model anger and frustration Just an idea What do the professionals who you all are working say about conscience Shannon just once in a while Karly has a positive feeling about her first family such as when her birth parent bought her koolaidwow theres a real great parent huh Anyway I point at that its good that at least she has ONE good memory about her but when she begins sentimentalizing she is reminded that the nice kool aid lady also left her alone for hours beat her screamed at her and cut her with a knife This way I figure she has a balanced perspective See you all later Denise Nontext portions of this message have been removed Message Date Tue Oct From Subject Re HIV Testing and Russia In wrote we needed the HIV only if we would

conversation for so many right now I decided to post directly to the list in hopes that I can share our experience We adopted our son now from Taraz in August of using Kids FirstFrank Foundation In answer to alot of your questions We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow that flight was hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest Our flight to Almaty left at pm We arrived in Almaty after a hour time difference and I believe the flight was about hours as well so it was about am Almaty time Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our coordinator the sun was just coming up We then went to her flat to rest some more and eat breakfast Although it seems like we had alot of time to rest it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us adjust to the time change We then went to the bank to get money that had been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night I believe we got to the train station about pm for the train to leave about pm We had our own cabin that had padded benches with clean linens plenty of pillows a table and a window We were able to store our luggage under the bences The door to our cabin locked from the inside and we felt completely safe the entire time We took alot of video footage of the towns we went through There were people that would try to sell stuff at each of the stops Everything from bottled water to fried chicken The bathrooms were not the greatest on the train but when you have to go you take what you can get although they were better than any portapotty I have ever been into here in the states Although I didnt visit other areas on the train one of the people we were traveling with did and said you will see all sorts of people that are in nonprivate cars but nobody ever bothered us We arrived at the Taraz train station around am and were met by the driver of the orphanage with his van We were brought to our host families flat to get settled and then went to the orphanage to meet our son Each day we were able to visit the bobek for about hours in the morning and hours in the afternoon Our court experience was short and noneventful We were able to have dinner with the orphanage director at a restraunt by her flat We were able to go to the store everyday for bottlednoncarbonated water and beer too We also visited the internet cafe which is just down the street from the telecom building It was very inexpensive We ate at a few restraunts in Taraz as well and never got sick One gentleman got sick from drinking some bad vodka but said it was just like he drank something that didnt agree with him he vomited once and was fine The train ride back to Almaty left about the same time and we had no worries with our son We made a bed for him on the floor between our benches and he slept the entire time Another couple I know made a bed for their infant in their small suitcase ontop of their clean clothes so the child wouldnt roll around One thing I cant express enough was the CHILDRENS CHEWABLE DRAMAMINE It is perfect and the last thing you want is a vomiting toddler on the plane It is messy and awful Also take lots of pictures While putting together my sons scrapbook of our journey to get him I realized I hadnt taken pictures of things that now are important If you have any questions

is subject to infoterms Message Date Wed Oct From Subject Re birth dates My husband and I are discussing the pros and cons of changing our soontobesons birthdate back a year We held each child back year in school from their American age peers but did NOT change their actual birthdates Initially I felt strongly that we should change their birthdates by year but Jackson felt VERY strongly that we should not His logic was that after we opted to change their Russian and Kazak names the only thing they brought with them from Kaz was their birthdates The school district initially placed a GREAT deal of pressure on us to place them with their age peers but we resisted and basically demanded that they be placed back year which was within our rights to do although the school district tried to convince us otherwise They kept telling us that ESL would catch the kids up soon enough but given the fact that neither child had much formal education we didnt feel starting them in nd and th grade was in their best interest So although our kids were and years old when they came home in April of we started them off in st and rd grade The kids then attended st and rd grade summer school and we moved them on to nd and th grade in September just over months after they came home Academically and socially they were really still about a year behind their classmates maybe more when they started nd and th grade last year but by the end of the school year they were almost working at grade level and were nearly on par socially with their classmates In terms of their sizes which was a MAJOR driver behind holding them back year I would say they were about in the middle of their classes in terms of their heights and weights when they started school HOWEVER after being home for months BOTH kids were at the th percentile for height for their AGES making them two of the tallest kids in their grades I dont have the exact figures on how much they grew but we know that in the first months after Nicholas left the orphanage he grew more than inches and Kira grew more than inches and gained pounds the first year home We did initially consider holding them back years from their age peers when they came home but we are VERY VERY glad now that we didnt do that If we had held them back grades instead of just one BOTH kids would have TOWERED over the other kids right now Academically they would have been better off but socially it would have been disasterous As it is now the kids look noticeably bigger than many of their classmates which is incredible given how small they were compared to most of the other kids when they came home Anyway this is what we did Laura Message Date Wed Oct GMT From Subject RE birth dates We gave our youngest a two year discount which actually puts her in

far as I know she has not gotten any formal schooling yet where she is even though she would be in Kindergarten or st grade here by now I want her to have every advantage to get the most out of her

Subject Re birth dates The hardest part about this decision and the one I think some people dont think enough about is what the childs situation is likely to be or years down the road Nicholas was at about the th percentile for height given his bio age when we brought him home but is now less than months after coming home at about the th percentile for height When we brought him home he looked to be about or years old but now looks every bit his years old Kira was about the size of a typical American year old when we first met her in NovemberDecember although she was years old She barely wore a size when we brought her home in April and looked by then to be about or years old Now less than months later she looks like any other year old and looks noticeably older than many of her classmates some of whom are almost years younger than she is now We NEVER would have believed how much the kids would grow and change in such a short time and Im sure its hard for other parents to imagine as well However I also know what we experienced doesnt happen in every case and that many kids remain small or about the same size as their younger classmates Knowing what will happen in any individual case is pretty much guessworkbut you should think about how you will handle a situation in which your child is significantly older than his or her classmates but does not have the academic strenght to skip a grade later on Message Date Tue Oct From McCarthy Subject Birth date adjustments Just our two cents worth about changingnot changing birthdates We chose NOT to adjust our sons age because he was already showing signs of being on the tall side even for a Kazak Liam was birthday is Oct when I brought him home on March this year Within a couple of weeks of coming home he was placed into a first grade in an Arlington VA public school with ESL classes for hours every morning This provided things for him he was placed with an age group that matched his social development plus he was still getting ESL We found Liam was reluctant to mix with any neighborhood children until he started school and socialized with American kids Since we have relocated to the Jacksonville FL area Liam has entered second grade in Clay County Here the ESOL classes are total immersion so that he is in with children from a variety of cultural backgrounds but they are allowed to only speak English in the classroom He is also taken for special work with the Title teacher as are some of the other children who lag behind in reading English andor math Weve noticed considerable growth in Liam over the last seven months in terms of height and maturity If he catches up academically we may consider skipping a grade However we dont make much of a deal over the year or two difference between he and some of his classmates He is by the way not the only one his age in his class Guess we feel as Laura said earlier that his birthdate was really the one thing that was all his from Kaz and it is as much a part of his identity as his brown eyes and warm smile Lynn Nontext portions of this message have been removed Message Date Tue Oct From TJ Klafehn Subject Re birth dates Could someone please clarify what

very well aware of how old he was this summer A parents wanting to be understanding of their childs sensitivity to hisher socialacademicphysical lag compared to hisher agelevel American counterparts seems laudable but I agree that this recourse should probably not be entered into lightly I had a year old in my classroom this summer who came from Russia when he was Aside from a bit of lingering

parents spoke almost entirely Russian around the house Message Date Wed Oct From Subject Re birth dates Could someone please clarify what is meant by changing their childs age Since their true age is part of their adoption records and visas I assume that you just mean to let them believe they are a different age Some parents legally change their childs age at the time of adoption in Kazakhstan From what I understand this is technically impossible to do in Kaz and Russia but I do know of parents who did this during the overseas adoption process usually to make their child years younger In other cases parents either tell their child they are a year younger than they actually are and the kids believe this while in other cases parents discuss it with the child and agree to consider the child a year or two younger Parents in many states also have the option to legally change their childs age at the time of readoption and sometimes can even petition a judge outside of a readoption Standards vary by state and sometimes by jurisdiction as to ifhow parents can do this so its best to talk with adoptive families in your community if you are considering legally changing your childs age For example I know parents who simply petitioned the court without any supporting documentation as to why the child should be made younger who successfully changed their kids ages while other parents had to submit dental medical and psychological records supporting the position that the child was younger than his or her stated age Yet it will be clear to the child immediately if not soon that they are engaged in some sort of deception no harshness intended wont it Wont they be inclined to want to tell others their true age Our year old sontobe was very well aware of how old he was this summer Not necessarily Many of these kids have no idea how old they are and some think they are one age but are actually another usually older age It depends on what the practice is in the orphanage some recognize birthdays and group kids by age while others do little if anything to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids according to age groups Our kids knew how old they were and the season their birthday was inbut I suspect that was ONLY because they were each in foster care and celebrated a birthday with their foster families just before their adoptions Your use of Yahoo Groups
