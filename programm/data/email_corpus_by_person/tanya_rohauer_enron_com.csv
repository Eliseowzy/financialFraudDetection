JavascriptenterLivePersonstandardandpoorsdefaultResearch The Road To Competitive Electricity Markets In Mexico Publication date Dec Analyst Jeffrey Wolinsky CFA New York Manuel E Borrajo New Yor k Santiago Carniado Mexico City Mexicos much anticipated energy reform seems to have been placed on hold u ntil mid The delay is due to two crucial factors The economic slowdo wn that has led to reduced electricity demand growth making reform seem le ss urgent and the controversial tax reform which is currently the primary focus of the Mexican Congress Under the current recession industrial gro wth has slowed considerably resulting in very little growth in electricity demand this year GDP growth which is tied to electricity growth for is projected at less than which is a far cry from growth in of just below In April the high electricity demand growth brought re serves down to nearly and led to fears that severe energy shortages were imminent However the new plants that came online this year as part of t he governments independent power producer IPP program combined with muc h lower demand growth in the later part of the year reduced the sense of u rgency Energy reform is likely to be very controversial and may require a constitu tional change to allow greater participation in the sector for private inve stors The rival political parties to President Vicente Foxs National Act ion Party PAN are expected to balk at any changes to the constitution but may accept changes to Mexicos enabling laws to offer openings to private capital The Mexican Constitution currently requires the state to provide e nergy services as part of its public service obligations Enabling laws can be changed however to exclude industry and commerce from the definition of public service which would allow a free market to operate in the electr icity sector Yet investors got a preview of the opposition to reform in J une when Congress blocked a proposal by President Fox to increase the amoun t of electricity that companies may sell to Comision Federal de Electricida d CFE Currently power companies that generate for their own use are perm itted to sell up to megawatts MW of excess power to CFE President Fox hoped to allow these companies to sell up to of their capacity to CFE Mexicos Congress ruled that this proposal was unconstitutional as it rep resented a change in law which cannot be done without first going through Congress Reform of the electricity sector in Mexico has become more of a p olitical issue than an economic one President Fox faces an uphill battle in devising an energy reform plan that satisfies Congress Many Mexicans believe that selling off stateowned com panies leads to higher prices worker layoffs and high profits for the new owners not improved service as government officials typically promise Ba ck in February President Ernesto Zedillo submitted a restructuring pr oposal to Congress that envisioned the disaggregation subdivision and sub sequent sale of distribution concessions and generation companies However the proposal died in Congress that year Therefore any proposal put forwa rd by President Fox will most likely not include plans to privatize the exi sting generation assets although there is the potential that the distribut ion assets could be subdivided and the concessions sold to private investor s The resistance to selling a substantial portion of CFEs generation assets creates a great challenge in Mexicos effort to establish a competitive ele ctricity market that will draw private investment into new generation plant s The challenge is unprecedented in that the government would like to crea te a competitive generation market while retaining ownership of about o f generation capacity There are no global examples of how to accomplish th is feat and to make investors comfortable that the market will truly be com petitive The problem Mexico faces is that investors will have to be assure d that the government will be prevented from keeping power prices artificia lly low to stimulate the economy during periods of economic slowdown The t wo issues that will have to be addressed are how CFE will determine the pri cing for its plants and the form of subsidies to CFE from the Mexican gover nment Market Pricing and Subsidies CFE faces the inverse of the market power issue that has plagued so many ot her competitive generation systems When an entity has market power in a gi ven region that entity can withhold its generation thereby forcing artifi cially inflated prices At this point the entity having market power ente rs the market and makes windfall profits Standard Poors has seen this s cenario played out in various markets all around the globe with the recent California crisis getting a great deal of attention Mexico would face the opposite problem because the government through CFE would own more than of the power generation and could exercise market power to artificially keep prices low by bidding CFEowned generators below their marginal cost This might be done to provide an economic stimulus to the economy and CFE could be reimbursed through some form of a subsidy from the government Be cause CFE owns such a substantial portion of the countrys generation one of its plants would likely be the marginal plant for a significant period o f time thereby eroding the profit margins of private generation companies In order to mitigate this risk for private generators the government must devise a law that would make it illegal to bid governmentowned plants at below their marginal cost and eliminate any loopholes for providing CFEown ed generation plants with government subsidies Any future government subsi dies would have to be made by the Mexican government to CFEs distribution or transmission subsidiary not to any generation subsidiary Another issue that needs to be addressed is what the government will do abo ut the existing subsidies In the government spent about billion subsidizing electricity bills and the estimate for is slightly highe r due to inflation and population growth In order to highlight these subsi dies to the population the format of electricity bills was changed in July to break out the cost of power and the amount that the government is contr ibuting as a subsidy As there are no plans to do away with these subsidies the government must structure them in a way that does not benefit CFEown ed generation plants to the detriment of privately owned plants One potent ial indirect subsidy to CFE that has been addressed is the price that CFE p ays for its fuel Under Mexican law all public entities are forbidden to s ell their products or services below market prices Therefore Petroleos Me xicanos PEMEX cannot legally provide CFEowned generators with fuel at su bsidized prices unless it offers those prices to all generators This miti gates the risk of CFE lowering its marginal cost through an indirect fuel s ubsidy from PEMEX cgibingxcgiTOP Need For Capital Investment The push toward competitive electricity markets in Mexico is driven by the need for investment in power generation and the reluctance of the Mexican g overnment to continue to add offbalance sheet debt in the form of the IPP contracts Mexico is forecast to require investments in the power sector of about billion per year during the next years to keep up with demand most of which is expected to come from private investors Although the cur rent economic conditions may adjust this forecast downward substantial inv estment will still be required in the sector Even though the IPP program h as been successful thus far Standard Poors views these contracts as off balance sheet debt of CFE which puts negative pressure on CFEs credit ra ting Because the obligations under many of these contracts cross default w ith CFEs debt which in turn cross defaults with some of the sovereign deb t these contracts also apply negative pressure to the sovereign rating Wh ile this pressure is not substantial today if the IPP program continues to be the sole source of new generation in Mexico these obligations will hav e a greater affect on the sovereign rating over time Therefore a move to a fully competitive electricity market where private investors take all of the financing risks will alleviate credit pressure on the sovereign from the electric sector In the interim the Comision Reguladora de Energia CRE is working on crea ting a framework for the potential liberalization of the industry CRE envi sions the creation of an independent system operator to manage generation c ommitment dispatch and billing Stateowned generators would be divided i nto regional entities to promote competition The distribution sector would also be divided into several regional entities and a concession for the o peration and maintenance of these systems could be granted The transmissio n network would remain as a single public entity although concessions for new transmission projects could be granted cgibingxcgiTOP Liberalization of the Electricity Sector During the past nine years Mexico has gradually liberalized the restrictio ns on the power market CFE enjoyed a monopoly in the electric power sector for many years although reforms instituted in allowed IPPs to sell p ower to CFE and industrial customers under selfsupply regulations In CFE devised a financing plan to meet projected electric demand growth Th e objectives of the plan were to lower the companys debt leverage finance projects at a lower cost and extend the maturities of these obligations As a result for the first time several new projects were structured as bu ildlease transfers BLT which are similar to lease transactions Under t his structure a third party finances and builds a plant or transmission l ine or transformer and leases the plant to CFE for a period during which the investment is amortized At the end of this timeframe ownership of the asset is transferred to CFE These BLT arrangements indirectly assigned mu ch of the operating risk to CFE as CFE was required to pay for service eve n if the asset was unavailable New facilities are now being constructed un der IPP contracts These arrangements are structured as takeandpay power purchase agreements whereby CFE will not pay for power if it is not deliver ed The next step would appear to be the creation of an open market system where participants are free to buy and sell electricity Yet the outlook f or the creation of such a system is unclear in Mexico given the highly pol iticized tripartisan environment that governs the decisionmaking process RatingsDirect Link is a FREE service provided by Standard Poors If you do not wish to receive further Emails related to this

JavascriptenterLivePersonstandardandpoorsdefaultResearch Commodities Futures and Swaps Contracts SetOff and Bankruptcy Publication date Dec Analyst Sabine Zerarka Esq New York James Penrose Esq New York Standard Poors regularly receives inquiries on the treatment of certain types of financial contracts such as commodity swaps and commodity futures contracts in the event of bankruptcy of one of the parties thereto These sorts of financial contracts are often used to hedge or insure against f uture financial liabilities of at least one of the parties Financial contr acts take many forms Many are executed pursuant to a master agreement whi ch provides for amounts owed from each party to the other to be deducted o r setoff so that a single amount will be owed by one party to the other As risk transfer mechanisms financial contracts are an important sourc e of market liquidity Consequently certain special types of financial con tracts have special protection under the US Bankruptcy Code In general a bankruptcy filing triggers an automatic stay that restrains creditors from taking actions against the debtor or its property As a res ult of the automatic stay creditors in general cannot exercise contractual remedies such as the exercise of setoff and closeout rights without th e permission of the bankruptcy court Because of the importance of financia l contracts however Congress provided that the liquidity of the swap and commodity markets would not be disrupted by the bankruptcy of participants by exempting certain qualifying financial contracts from the automatic stay In appropriate cases therefore the nonbankrupt partys contractual righ t to set off amounts owed to it under a particular financial contract again st cash securities or other property of the bankrupt party held by or due from the nonbankrupt party is protected notwithstanding the bankruptcy of the counterparty Business dealings of course often result in more complicated issues than can be addressed by a straightforward application of blackletter law The following are some of the questions that investors have asked about setoff and netting of liabilities under financial contracts Q What types of financial contract can be setoff or netted A Financial contracts that qualify as protected contracts under the Code c an be netted Financial contracts must fall within certain definitions in t he Code to qualify as protected contracts The Code also requires that such contracts must be between particular types of entities such as commoditie s brokers financial institutions stockbrokers etc in order for the fin ancial contract to be protected under the Code Q In a situation where Party A and Party B have entered into several d ifferent financial contracts with each other can Party A net its in the m oney obligations against its out of the money obligations if Party B goe s bankrupt A With respect to financial contracts that are protected contracts under t he Code definitions and which by their terms permit termination and liquid ation Party A may terminate the contract liquidate collateral and net o ut any termination values Pursuant to Code sections and these rights are not subject to the automatic stay and cannot be avoided or otherwise limited under the Code or by the bankruptcy court in a reorga nization or a liquidation Furthermore Code section which establishes the automatic stay create s specific exceptions from the stay for set off of mutual claims under comm odity contracts and set off of mutual claims under swaps that constitute th e set off of a claim against the debtor for a margin payment or settleme nt payment However the stay does apply to crossproduct setoffsswap claims against commodity contracts claims for example For crossproduct setoffs Code section provides that setoff rights are not affected by bankruptcy but are subject to the automatic stay Permission from the bank ruptcy court therefore is necessary before Party B could exercise its con tractual setoff rights across different types of financial contracts Set off in other words is not automatic in these circumstances Although cros sproduct netting may not be protected from the automatic stay Party B is still treated as a secured creditor to the extent of its setoff rights Q In what circumstances could a bankruptcy court rescind a netting of swap or commodities claim A Grounds for contesting setoff may include the failure of a particular f inancial contract to qualify as a protected contract under the Code or the failure of a particular financial contract to permit setoff Q Aside from any netting benefits realized by Party A against Party B whe re does Party A stand with respect to amounts owed to it under the financia l contract that have not been realized through setoff A After termination liquidation and setoff Party A will have an unsecu red claim against Party B Q Are payments made by a debtor prior to bankruptcy under swaps or commodi ty contracts at risk of being clawed back as a preferential transfer or fra udulent conveyance A Generally no Code section provides that the bankruptcy trustee may not avoid any prepetition margin or settlement payment made by or to a com modity broker forward contract merchant stockbroker financial institutio n or securities clearing agency or any prepetition transfer under a swap agreement made by or to a swap participant as a preferential transfer or fr audulent conveyance except where such payments are made with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud creditors Q In a situation where Party B goes bankrupt and there are financial contr acts between Party A and Party B where Party B is in the money between Pa rty B and Party C where Party C is in the money and between Party C and Pa rty A where Party A is in the money can Party C set off its payment to Par ty A to the extent of its claim against Party B A No Setoff in bankruptcy is only possible where mutuality exists ie one party must owe a debt to another party that other party must owe a debt to the first party As a result Party As claim will belong to the b ankruptcy estate of Party B while Party C will be a general creditor of Par ty B No setoff will be permitted in these circumstances RatingsDirect Link is a FREE service provided by Standard Poors If you do not wish to receive further Emails related to this topic only please s

RE Trades as ENA Justin Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legalcredit issues However isnt this only the tip of the iceberg What about nonEOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty From my time in London it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory SFA issues Please comment Also as a commercially efficient course of action It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to train our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub at least it was in the past at their request and somehow initially set up our contractsISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle Is this possible Otherwise the permutations of various legalcredittaxregulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous Bill Original Message From Boyd Justin Sent September To Dyk Russell Shackleton Sara White Bill Shankman Jeffrey A Cc Abramo Caroline Zivic Robyn Diamond Daniel Radous Paul Lebrocq Wendi Sharma Shifali Juggins Janine Nelson Roderick Subject RE Trades as ENA Russell My view would be to follow the novation route ie CP trades via EOL with ECTRIC Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master ENA enters into backtoback trade with ECTRIC This does mean that the CP must initially accept the European EOL GTCs though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs Justin Original Message From Dyk Russell Sent September To Shackleton Sara Boyd Justin White Bill Shankman Jeffrey A Cc Abramo Caroline Zivic Robyn Diamond Daniel Radous Paul Lebrocq Wendi Sharma Shifali Subject FW Trades as ENA Everyone Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs We just did two WTIBrent crude oil spreads today one w very large volume and expect to be doing more such deals This is more than just a legal issue its going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well As we understand it the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w ENA and not w ECTRIC so they and I assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ENA To satisfy both parties desires all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA Sara from speaking to you and from Justins response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ENA in Houston okays w the counterparty on ENAs behalf However there seem to be other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this As Sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and timeconsuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option From the credit side as we understand it the issue w not backtobacking the trades w ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in Houston and therefore not monitored In other words any exposure not sitting w ENA will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will be incorrect From the EnronOnline side as we see it there are a couple of issues EOL wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online However they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based Also they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTIBrent crude oil spread online If neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate ISDA w ECTRIC which potentially means as above more onerous and timeconsuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL We can assure you that they will not accept this These are the issues as we see them from the origination side There may be other issues that were missing from the sides that Ive mentioned as well as the tradingback office side Regards Russ Original Message From

Beyhum Maya Cc Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Marsh Jonathan Subject RE Trades as ENA i agree assuming you follow janines approach then no adverse UK regulatory issues will ensue justin Original Message From Juggins Janine Sent July To Beyhum Maya Boyd Justin Cc Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Subject RE Trades as ENA I assume that these are financial transactions The current approach is the right one in the circumstances ie trade between ECTRIC and ENA trade between ENA and third party eg Bank of America It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC To avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC arranged by EEFT instead of ECTRIC effective November Regards Janine Original Message From Beyhum Maya Sent July To Juggins Janine Boyd Justin Cc Sharma Shifali Subject Trades as ENA Hi I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA eg Bank of America As a result if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader who trades under ENA and Bank Of America The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office We were wondering about a couple of things Are there any taxlegal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration
