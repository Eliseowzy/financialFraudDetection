<9036734.1075844214585.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bruno.gaillard@enron.com,2001-06-01 12:07:00,Background Information France ElectricityThe Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a balancing responsibility contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Market Conventions A range of wholesale electricity products are currently traded in France Peak and baseload dayahead weekahead monthly quaterly and yearly products are traded Peak products follow the German convention hour peaks on weekdays hh Contract sizes are typically MW or MW Gate closure for scheduling imports exports and transits is h Paris time Gate closure for scheduling echanges de blocs is h Paris time Other The Gas Market A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted for mid and it i s expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end A zonaldistancerelated tariff was published on July by GdFTransportation A permanent entryexit tariff structure is likely to be developed for Charges for imbalances are expensive and access to storage is restricted GdFTrading however has published conditions for balancing services There is only one trading Hub for France located at the FrenchBelgian bord er BlaregniesTaisniSres Due to the distancerelated nature of the transportation tariff competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a re located not too far less than about Km from the FrenchBelgian border The main imports into France are for high cal gas and GdF has published th e conditions for high callow cal gas swaps As there is not yet a gas law in France a Projet de Loi was approv ed on th May transposing the EU gas directive into domestic legislation the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to date and the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to customers from new

conventions by possibly adding gate closure information peak vs offpea k and other relevant information Bruno Updated May Background The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments OLE Object Picture Metafile Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment OLE Object Picture Metafile The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a balancing responsibility contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Market Conventions Traders Need to Add gate closer information and onpeak off peak hours pl us whatever

also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession

varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for

Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity

the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in

Philip NRON Brun Raphael Brod Simon Styles Peter Dindarova Nailia Shaw Eric Elliott Mark Subject RE EdF capacity auctions All I would suggest we need to do the following Register for the auction and receipt of the IM asap Bruno could you please discuss with Mark and put together our registration document I assume that ECTRL meets the criteria of a trader registered in an EU member state Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other regulatory qualifiers such as balancing agreements as yet Mark agree Bruno could you please take care of sending this registration letter agree with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey but also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capacity release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter thoughts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM but no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The use of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered this in previous submissions

access to some of its generation capacity as a condition for EU approval of its purchase of a percent stake in German utility EnBW In the next two years EdF will auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smaller producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baseload and MW of cogeneration The whole MW

integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on

eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently

Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession

failing to meet the required EU deadline Dozens Dozens I would replace this with Several of application decrees still have to be passed including tariffs to eligible industrials The French power

varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for

Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity

better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and

to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will

Philip NRON Brun Raphael Brod Simon Styles Peter Dindarova Nailia Shaw Eric Elliott Mark Subject RE EdF capacity auctions All I would suggest we need to do the following Register for the auction and receipt of the IM asap Bruno could you please discuss with Mark and put together our registration document I assume that ECTRL meets the criteria of a trader registered in an EU member state Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other regulatory qualifiers such as balancing agreements as yet Mark agree Bruno could you please take care of sending this registration letter agree with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey but also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capacity release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter thoughts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM but no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The use of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered this in previous submissions

utility Electricite de France EdF announced on Thursday details of its first auction to sell electricity production capacity to competitors EdF was required by the EU Commission in February to give access to some of its generation capacity as a condition for EU approval of its purchase of a percent stake in German utility EnBW In the next two years EdF will auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smaller producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baseload and MW of cogeneration The whole MW should be sold by October EdF which has a percent share of the French generation market has a total installed capacity of MW Original Message From Dindarova Nailia Sent May To Gaillard Bruno Philip

Decision on Merger imposing capacity release Trustee mandate that we proposed to the EU Initial VPP proposal by EDF Original Message From Sankey Ross Sent June To de Gaulle Pierre Cc Gaillard Bruno Philip NRON Brun Raphael Brod Simon Styles Peter Dindarova Nailia Shaw Eric Elliott Mark Subject RE EdF capacity auctions All I would suggest we need to do the following Register for the auction and receipt of the IM asap Bruno could you please discuss with Mark and put together our registration document I assume that ECTRL meets the criteria of a trader registered in an EU member state Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other regulatory qualifiers such as balancing agreements as yet Mark agree Bruno could you please take care of sending this registration letter agree with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey but also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capacity release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter thoughts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM but no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The use of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered this in previous submissions to MTF EdF etc this should be easy to identify as we go forward Any comments Ross Original Message From de Gaulle Pierre Sent June To Sankey Ross Cc Gaillard Bruno Philip NRON Brun Raphael Brod Simon Styles Peter Dindarova Nailia Subject RE EdF capacity auctions other EU news Point This info is of a preliminary nature and is subject to change In addition it is mentioned in point that registered companies for the auction will have the opportunity to ask questions and raise issues during conferences which will be then considered by EdF Specifications of the auction will be finalised by end August This seems to leave some room for a complete feedback from registered companies Lets discuss the content of the PIM I suggest to arrange anothe meeting with PWCRothschild in the next few weeks week June What about a potential meeting with the Trustee about the PIM Pierre From Ross UEnronXGate on To Bruno UEnronXGate Philip NRON Pierre de CT Raphael CT Simon CT cc Peter CT Nailia CT Subject RE EdF capacity auctions other EU news Bruno Quel surprise Should make your follow up with the MTF interesting as to the role of the Trustee One point to note for both MTF and Albers at COMP the lack of within day flexibility is hardly in keeping with the intention of supporting development of retail supply to end users with fluctuating demand Suppliers will thus be at the mercy of EdF in the balancing market In addition how on earth can they be allowed to take years to complete the process How does that fit with merger remedy Somewhat ironic that they have the document in English Lets discuss what if anyhting we can do after you have spoken with MTF Regards Ross Original Message From Gaillard Bruno Sent May To Philip NRON Sankey Ross de Gaulle Pierre Brun Raphael Brod Simon Cc

quick look it seems that flexibility is not a option nomination at noon and price has not changed File VPP MIPpdf Bruno UK EDF ISSUES DETAILS OF ITS FIRST CAPACITY AUCTION LONDON May Reuters French utility Electricite de France EdF announced on Thursday details of its first auction to sell electricity production capacity to competitors EdF was required by the EU Commission in February to give access to some of its generation capacity as a condition for EU approval of its purchase of a percent stake in German utility EnBW In the next two years EdF will auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smaller producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baseload and MW of cogeneration The whole MW should be sold by October EdF which has a percent share of the French generation market has a total installed capacity of MW Original Message From Dindarova Nailia Sent May To Gaillard Bruno Philip

integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a balancing responsibility contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges

Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies

contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a three year contractual framework New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision from the Ministry of Industry which is the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EdF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen t eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a programme responsible contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime It is likely that this new tariff will implement a injection delive ry calculation factor Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports and imports This allocation rule is likely to change by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come The CRE Commission de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process market prices and optional structures The establishment of programme responsible contrac ts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end A zonaldistancerelated tariff was disclosed published on July by GdFTransportation A permanent entryexit tariff structure is likely to be developed for Charges for imbalances are expensive and access t o storage is restricted GdFTrading however has published conditions for balancing services There is only one trading Hub for France located at the FrenchBelgian bord er BlaregniesTaisniSres Due to the distancerelated nature of the transportation tariff competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a re located not too far less than about Km from the FrenchBelgian border The main imports into France are for high cal gas and GdF has published th e conditions for high callow cal gas swaps As there is not yet a new gas law in France a Projet de Loi was approved on th May transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic legislation the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed todate and the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to customers from new entrants it is already possible to optimise gas supply through import of blocs for part or full supply ECTRL was the first new entrant to supply gas at the French border and more recently into France ECTRLs cumulative volume of gas trades so far totals million cubic meters
