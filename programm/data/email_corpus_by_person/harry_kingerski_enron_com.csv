is far and away better than anything we can match and that it is a subsidized price because it does not explicitly recognize ancillary service imbalance and retailer costs except for the pittances we got added in the case a year ago So we can ask that the same subsidies be maintained for customers wo have chosen thusfar grandfathered in other words Going forward it seems that elimination of the

presentation to yesterdays ICC Electric Policy Committee Meeting that we thought you would find to be of interest From the Chicago Tribune ComEd wants to limit power purchase option By Melita Marie Garza Tribune staff reporter October Commonwealth Edison Co on Tuesday proposed weaning its largest commercial and industrial customers from a power purchase plan that the company asserts stifles competition in the states emerging market for electricity Under the proposal the utility would differentiate between industrial customers that use less than kilowatts of electricity at any given moment and those that use more Pamela Strobel ComEds chairman told the Illinois Commerce Commission A standard Jewel or Dominicks grocery store uses about kilowatts of electricity at a given moment Strobel said Under deregulation corporate customers have three options Stay with ComEds standard regulated electricity service based on rates set in pick an alternative supplier or opt for ComEds socalled Power Purchase Option Customers who pick the last option get ComEds market rate but are allowed to choose ComEd competitors as their primary power suppliers ComEds proposal would bar its largest customers from that option which the utility says has stymied deregulation because it allows competing suppliers to merely resell the power that ComEd produced So long as the utility is providing this option real competitive markets wont work said Arlene Juracek ComEds vice president for regulatory and strategic services Some suppliers have taken the easy way out by telling their customers to sign up for the plan Terry Harvill an ICC member agreed There was an unintended problem rather than alternative suppliers coming into Illinois with diverse sources of energy essentially you have them just taking power from ComEd and reselling it to customers Harvill said Specifically ComEd proposes to limit the Power Purchase Option to nonresidential customers paying competitive transition charges effective June The transition charges cover costs incurred by the utility prior to deregulation I think its a step in the right direction but the details remain to be worked out Harvill said He noted that companies still would have the option to fall back on ComEds traditional regulated plan But Marty Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board was skeptical There are certain inherent conflicts in the way that Edison sees the world because they are a subsidiary of a much larger companyExelonwhich is in fact the largest producer and seller of electricity in this market Cohen said So you have ComEd on the one hand being the largest buyer of electricity and you have Exelon its parent company being the largest seller of electricity This proposal doesnt address

schedule and time period onpeak offpeak to quantify the sensitivity to different types of rate designs For instance if there is a large increase in summer onpeak how much of the increase can we avoid with aggressive DSM etc Can we look at this quantification today Scott ES PM To James W ES cc Don Black Tamara ES harry kingerski Subject Draft Testimony re PGESCE for Discussion Harry and I are meeting tomorrow I would like any feedback you have related to the following Based on our position we would prefer Later surcharges Lower surcharges Surcharges that are lower in the summer flatter is better because it is closer the NPV effects and our rapidly diminishing position The proposal below could either result in Delay of a month while they consider this complicated affair low likelihood Lower surcharge if we can convince people that market rates are MWh for a year when they are actually We would only get a MWh increase as compared to a MWh increase ie times MWh yields MWh is our story when the actural is times MWh yields MWh The Enron rates below are effectively much flatter than the CPUC proposal Thus we would be better off if accepted Additionally if our noise causes a flat MWh increase to replace the CPUC proposal we are better off Additionally we could sell hedging on the exposed to markets DSM related to capital investments should be less risky The risks to Enron are Proposal makes it easy to hit the large customers with a lower baseline ie instead of Would make DSM more risky DSM providers would have to buy hedges to proceed The questions to answer are Could Enron provide witnesses without drawing more negatives Would a partner tow the Enron line Forwarded by Scott StonessHOUEES on PM Scott Stoness PM To Tamara ES cc harry kingerski Subject Draft Testimony re PGESCE for Discussion Summary The CPUC should implement two part RTPTOU rates for PGESCE A two part rate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of normal load and pay market value for consumption incremental or decremental to normal load The CPUC should define normal consumption as consumption over and above of historical consumption The CPUC should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by DWR for spot purchases in that hour In the event that implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is complicated to design the MWh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is possible The current draft design of the CPUC is discriminatory to large customers The current draft design of the CPUC does not provide appropriate price signals The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are unneccessarly high The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are far in excess of those which the CPUC intended The current draft design of the CPUC results is static and does not respond to changing market conditions Design Goals The CPUC should design rates that Give appropriate price signals to customers to consume conserve energy as as close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible Treat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner Achieve targeted revenue requirements Are easy to administer and understand Summary of CPUC Illustrative Design The CPUC has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to marginal rates Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in Summer Weekdays from noon to PM Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in all other hours Critique based on Design Goals Draft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short The rates for power Mar based on DJNP on peak is MWh The rates for power Mar based on DJNP off peak is MWh The proposed marginal rates for E Secondary is MWh for on peak and off peak This rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in lower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods Draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis E Transmission Voltage customers will experience a rate increase E Secondary voltage customers will experience a rate increase A Medium General Service customers will experience a rate increase A Small LP customers will experience a rate increase The marginal price signal for A will be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the on peak summer The marginal price signal for E wills be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the off peak periods PGE has a longer summer period than SCE This results in a increase for SCE TOUSub as compared to increases for PGE E Transmission rate The proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for SCE customers than PGE customers For example the on peak rate for SCE TOUSub is MWh as compared to PGE E Transmission rate of MWh Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue Draft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge increase does not ocur until May for PGE and June for SCE it should be possible to implement Enron Proposed Rates Enron proposes Two part real time pricing time of use rate Usage up to of historical use would be billed at historical rates Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak where customers has real time metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has time of use metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at of DJNP On Peak and of DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has just energy metering Critique based on Design Goals Enron proposals charge all customer at very close to marginal rates Thus within the constraints of using Dow Jones the rates should be very close to the actual marginal rates The rates will not be exact because they are Determined on the previous day Ony differentiate between on and off peak as compared to hour by hour To the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability the rates will be determined on a class average basis However the rates be far superior to the CPUC draft design because They give better price signals to night consumption They give better signals to weekend consumption They give better signals to winter consumption They are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of marginal costs For example if summer costs are lower the rate will be lower The Enron proposal will motivate DSM activities in winter summer and off peak Enron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of utility and rate class The Enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial as with residential ABX provides that residential customers that consume energy below normal rates will not have increased rates This design also achieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue but even more importantly it ensures tracking of costs Setting the normal load at of historical load results in a MWh increase if the market value for the entire year is MWh In the event that the market value for the entire year is less than MWh the resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue The Enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can easily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price signals and revenue targets The revenue outcome is less certain than the CPUC draft design however the impact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up when the costs go up Draft proposal require greater implementation details than the CPUC design but such extra costs are worthwhile The Enron proposal requires Determination of historical loads for large customers Determination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers Determination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers Determination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new customer Then Enron proposal has the following negatives Some customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better off even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new price signals The rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different for each customer The rates may take more work to put in place for the utility The rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates depending upon the historical consumption of the customers Q In the event that it is not possible to implement the Enron rates by June what would you propose a an interim solution A The CPUC draft rates are so flawed that it would be superior to just implement a flat MWh surcharge to all customers This approach would be fairer and simpler Q Who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers A The DWR will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in rates of the utilities The are indifferent to buy more generation or selling less energy to customers Thus the DWR should be willing to pay for decremental consumption In the event that the DWR is not agreeable to paying for decremental consumption the utility should be allowed to borrow such funds and have the costs amortized for the next years In the event that the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption the normal load could be defined of historical and the CPUC could eliminate credits resulting from decremental consumption Such solution would discourage conservation below but would not be expected to diminish the effectiveness of the Enron proposed rates Q Why is DJNP the right index to choose A DJNP and DJSP are availble for each weekday for on and off peak pricing The index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day for today The DJ index is compiled based on the information provided by many of the large trading companies including Enron The numbers provided by the participants are subject to audit Thus DJ is the best avaible information available for energy pricing Q What index is suitable for weekends A Enron proposes that the average DJNP off peak energy

t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers The utility requests a day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September September is a Satur day Reply comments would be filed days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of approximately of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment period would last for days and commence days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over or undercommitment In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a reentry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a neart erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and reentry fee s should also apply There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings Please let me and others know if you agree Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland

schedule and time period onpeak offpeak to quantify the sensitivity to different types of rate designs For instance if there is a large increase in summer onpeak how much of the increase can we avoid with aggressive DSM etc Can we look at this quantification today Scott ES PM To James W ES cc Don Black Tamara ES harry kingerski Subject Draft Testimony re PGESCE for Discussion Harry and I are meeting tomorrow I would like any feedback you have related to the following Based on our position we would prefer Later surcharges Lower surcharges Surcharges that are lower in the summer flatter is better because it is closer the NPV effects and our rapidly diminishing position The proposal below could either result in Delay of a month while they consider this complicated affair low likelihood Lower surcharge if we can convince people that market rates are MWh for a year when they are actually We would only get a MWh increase as compared to a MWh increase ie times MWh yields MWh is our story when the actural is times MWh yields MWh The Enron rates below are effectively much flatter than the CPUC proposal Thus we would be better off if accepted Additionally if our noise causes a flat MWh increase to replace the CPUC proposal we are better off Additionally we could sell hedging on the exposed to markets DSM related to capital investments should be less risky The risks to Enron are Proposal makes it easy to hit the large customers with a lower baseline ie instead of Would make DSM more risky DSM providers would have to buy hedges to proceed The questions to answer are Could Enron provide witnesses without drawing more negatives Would a partner tow the Enron line Forwarded by Scott StonessHOUEES on PM Scott Stoness PM To Tamara ES cc harry kingerski Subject Draft Testimony re PGESCE for Discussion Summary The CPUC should implement two part RTPTOU rates for PGESCE A two part rate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of normal load and pay market value for consumption incremental or decremental to normal load The CPUC should define normal consumption as consumption over and above of historical consumption The CPUC should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by DWR for spot purchases in that hour In the event that implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is complicated to design the MWh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the implementation of two part RTPTOU rates is possible The current draft design of the CPUC is discriminatory to large customers The current draft design of the CPUC does not provide appropriate price signals The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are unneccessarly high The current draft design of the CPUC results in rate increases to large customers that are far in excess of those which the CPUC intended The current draft design of the CPUC results is static and does not respond to changing market conditions Design Goals The CPUC should design rates that Give appropriate price signals to customers to consume conserve energy as as close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible Treat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner Achieve targeted revenue requirements Are easy to administer and understand Summary of CPUC Illustrative Design The CPUC has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to marginal rates Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in Summer Weekdays from noon to PM Draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about MWh for E Secondary from in all other hours Critique based on Design Goals Draft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short The rates for power Mar based on DJNP on peak is MWh The rates for power Mar based on DJNP off peak is MWh The proposed marginal rates for E Secondary is MWh for on peak and off peak This rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in lower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods Draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis E Transmission Voltage customers will experience a rate increase E Secondary voltage customers will experience a rate increase A Medium General Service customers will experience a rate increase A Small LP customers will experience a rate increase The marginal price signal for A will be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the on peak summer The marginal price signal for E wills be MWh vs MWh for E transmission in the off peak periods PGE has a longer summer period than SCE This results in a increase for SCE TOUSub as compared to increases for PGE E Transmission rate The proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for SCE customers than PGE customers For example the on peak rate for SCE TOUSub is MWh as compared to PGE E Transmission rate of MWh Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue Draft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge increase does not ocur until May for PGE and June for SCE it should be possible to implement Enron Proposed Rates Enron proposes Two part real time pricing time of use rate Usage up to of historical use would be billed at historical rates Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak where customers has real time metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at DJNP On Peak and DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has time of use metering Usage incremental or decremental to of historical use would be billed at of DJNP On Peak and of DJNP Off Peak averaged over the month where customers has just energy metering Critique based on Design Goals Enron proposals charge all customer at very close to marginal rates Thus within the constraints of using Dow Jones the rates should be very close to the actual marginal rates The rates will not be exact because they are Determined on the previous day Ony differentiate between on and off peak as compared to hour by hour To the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability the rates will be determined on a class average basis However the rates be far superior to the CPUC draft design because They give better price signals to night consumption They give better signals to weekend consumption They give better signals to winter consumption They are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of marginal costs For example if summer costs are lower the rate will be lower The Enron proposal will motivate DSM activities in winter summer and off peak Enron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of utility and rate class The Enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial as with residential ABX provides that residential customers that consume energy below normal rates will not have increased rates This design also achieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers Draft proposal does do a good job of recovering b of revenue but even more importantly it ensures tracking of costs Setting the normal load at of historical load results in a MWh increase if the market value for the entire year is MWh In the event that the market value for the entire year is less than MWh the resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue The Enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can easily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price signals and revenue targets The revenue outcome is less certain than the CPUC draft design however the impact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up when the costs go up Draft proposal require greater implementation details than the CPUC design but such extra costs are worthwhile The Enron proposal requires Determination of historical loads for large customers Determination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers Determination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers Determination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new customer Then Enron proposal has the following negatives Some customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better off even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new price signals The rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different for each customer The rates may take more work to put in place for the utility The rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates depending upon the historical consumption of the customers Q In the event that it is not possible to implement the Enron rates by June what would you propose a an interim solution A The CPUC draft rates are so flawed that it would be superior to just implement a flat MWh surcharge to all customers This approach would be fairer and simpler Q Who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers A The DWR will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in rates of the utilities The are indifferent to buy more generation or selling less energy to customers Thus the DWR should be willing to pay for decremental consumption In the event that the DWR is not agreeable to paying for decremental consumption the utility should be allowed to borrow such funds and have the costs amortized for the next years In the event that the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption the normal load could be defined of historical and the CPUC could eliminate credits resulting from decremental consumption Such solution would discourage conservation below but would not be expected to diminish the effectiveness of the Enron proposed rates Q Why is DJNP the right index to choose A DJNP and DJSP are availble for each weekday for on and off peak pricing The index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day for today The DJ index is compiled based on the information provided by many of the large trading companies including Enron The numbers provided by the participants are subject to audit Thus DJ is the best avaible information available for energy pricing Q What index is suitable for weekends A Enron proposes that the average DJNP off peak energy charges for friday and monday be used to determine the weekend rates for the purpose of rate setting
