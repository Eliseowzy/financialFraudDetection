which has operations in Canada the North Sea and west Africa said it had cut Alberta heavy oil production this month by bpd and that the cut would remain in place until prices improve The company said that the reduction of the high cost heavy crude represents about of its current overall oil and natural gas production of bpd of oil equivalent Canadian Natural will fund drilling in only heavy oil wells next year compared with this year The slumping petroleum market has also led to the postponement of its Primrose Alberta SAGD project until next spring SAGD is a process which pumps steam into the earth to heat up the crude allowing it to flow to the surface Canadian heavy crude carries a big discount because it requires an extensive refining process to turn it into gasoline and other petroleum products The company said if prices improve by the end of the first quarter it will bring much of the idle production back online quickly In the meantime Canadian Natural has completed a mile extension to its mile ECHO heavy oil pipeline in Alberta providing access to transportation for some of its production properties The line which transports heated heavy oil allows the company to

oil minister seem to indicate that OPEC is ready to go ahead with a planned production cut of million bpd after receiving commitments from nonmember producers to also reduce exports The minister said that OPEC would announce the reductions at a meeting in Cairo on Friday The remarks put an end to a threatened price war between the cartel and nonOPEC producers The cartel had accused the nonaligned producers of taking advantage of curbs already implemented this year by OPEC to grab a larger share of the market The cartel had demanded that the nonmember producing countries trim bpd from exports before it would once again slice production To date Russia Mexico Norway Oman and Angola have pledged cuts totaling bpd which appears to be enough to convince OPEC to proceed with its cut The ministers also seem to be comfortable with the level of commitment by the nonmembers to stick to their quotas for the specified month period The new restrictions will lower exports for OPEC producers

December th decision that the Midwest ISO be the vehicle for a single regional transmission organization in the Midwest is an important decision It will spark the development of a competitive regional power market in the Midwest of particular importance to energyintensive Midwestern states according to a customer coalition active in the federal arena The Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy UsersOhio stated that FERCs decision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest transmission grid that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba Canada up and running The coordination so critical to system reliability and Ohios business and industry can now proceed on a timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of problems we saw a couple of summers ago Because the Midwest economy is so energyintensive the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out in FERCs Order The Commission made plain that the Alliance companies could continue with the formation of the forprofit Transco but under the Midwest ISO umbrella The significance of this is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single organization as opposed to its form From the perspective of market participants both buyers and sellers this and other recent FERC decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry FERCs

Nigerias presidential adviser on energy will takeover as OPEC President on January st making it even more important that it adhere to the quota Some cartel members say that full compliance will be

will ship million tonnes of Kazakh and tonnes of Azeri crude in the st quarter of next year Although the schedule looks like a firm pledge to reduce exports there is no benchmark figure to which the

December th decision that the Midwest ISO be the vehicle for a single regional transmission organization in the Midwest is an important decision It will spark the development of a competitive regional power market in the Midwest of particular importance to energyintensive Midwestern states according to a customer coalition active in the federal arena The Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy UsersOhio stated that FERCs decision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest transmission grid that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba Canada up and running The coordination so critical to system reliability and Ohios business and industry can now proceed on a timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of problems we saw a couple of summers ago Because the Midwest economy is so energyintensive the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out in FERCs Order The Commission made plain that the Alliance companies could continue with the formation of the forprofit Transco but under the Midwest ISO umbrella The significance of this is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single organization as opposed to its form From the perspective of market participants both buyers and sellers this and other recent FERC decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry FERCs

reductions of its own However the former communist country does not appear willing to cooperate despite a plunge in prices from a year ago offering a token cut of bpd from its million bpd production Former stateowned companies in Russia have boosted oil output by resurrecting fields in Siberia Higher oil prices over the last years aided the turnaround in the Russian oil industry providing funding for new drilling and boosting production After communism fell many companies were acquired cheaply by influential members of the previous regime who exhibit a reluctance to slice output even with oil prices around per barrel as they try to boost their global market share Some in Russia say that per barrel is a fair price and that the country should work with Norway and the EU to maintain that price Traders say they do not expect any significant reductions from Russia Although the government maintains leverage over its oil companies by controlling export pipelines the current administration has set its sights on improving relations with the US which many think want cheaper oil The country has a population of million and exports only of its oil and of refined products which can be shipped

the September th attacks because of worries that the highly flammable substance could cause mass destruction if it became the target of a terrorist attack The Coast Guard eventually decided to allow

deal has sparked worries that the lack of competition could lead to volatile prices As smaller companies leave the market the handful that remain will be dealing in progressively larger volumes which could result in increased price volatility So far the FTC has presented very little in the way of a roadblock to the mergers and takeovers However critics fear that if the fastpaced trend in combining companies continues the nation could perhaps end up with only supergiant oil companies promoting a lack of competition and causing consumers to pay much higher prices But if crude oil and natural gas prices collapse only the biggest companies will survive The big mergers not only cut corporate costs but also increases a companys ability to deal in the Middle East Some analysts see the merger mania as an ongoing cyclical process and say that at some point in the future there could be a rash of spinoffs in the industry ConocoPhillips will become the th largest oil company in the world and the rd largest in the US behind Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco The ConocoPhillips merger is seen by many as a partnership of equals made to survive in an industry of giants as the combined company will only

the companys coffers BP made over billion in net profit for the rd quarter Tax on its oil supplies in some countries including Britain are levied at the price those stocks were worth at production As a result lower prices in the quarter equate to lower taxes relative to earnings which are usually measured at current costs However the tax concessions BP earns in some countries like the US are made

NOV Energy Industry May See Substantial thQuarter Write Downs The rash of energy acquisitions earlier in the year could take a heavy toll on th quarter bottom lines of a number of companies There are predictions that th quarter writedowns in the energy industry could total as much as billion According to accounting principles companies are required to recalculate the value of their oil and natural gas reserves at endofquarter prices and take a charge if the value is less than that on their books The lucrative natural gas market of the s st and nd quarters led to increased costs of acquisitions and drilling activity Last winter and spring many in the industry thought that natural gas prices would be in the per Mcf range for the foreseeable future and many acquisitions were based on those numbers But natural gas prices were at per Mcf at years end amid a wilting economy and unseasonably mild weather which ate away at demand for natural gas At the end of the rd quarter Anadarko took a pretax charge of million on its Canadian oil and gas assets In addition Burlington Resources has said it will take a pretax charge of up to million due to the planned sale of assets worth about

Demand Worries and OPEC Compliance Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX lost to per barrel on Friday slipping under per barrel for the first time in nearly weeks Crude futures fell almost last week after both the API and EIA reported huge inventory builds for distillates As mild weather in the Northeast and an economic recession has produced a total surplus of million barrels in inventories traders are concerned that production cuts made by OPEC and noncartel producers will not be enough to rescue oil prices in the short term Many doubt that any of the producers will actually stick to their selfimposed output curbs however some may come closer than others It is the degree of cheating on quotas that will determine the near term future of prices If OPEC and nonOPEC producers can remove enough oil from the market to somewhat balance supply and demand prices will likely remain stable or rise accordingly Barring that event the market will have to wait until an expected economic recovery in the second half of the year results in increased demand in order for prices to rebound significantly The prospect for compliance was dimmed somewhat when Russia announced last week that there would be no January limits on exports of fuel oil Sibneft Russias th largest producer has also said it will increase production in by almost million metric tons Saudi Arabia has told

peak heating oil season slips into spring OPECs latest production cut on January st has yet to be felt in the US and there are many concerns about the degree to which exports have been reduced The IEA says that the implementation of the production cut commitments have the potential to support crude prices and set the stage for later price gains A draw in oil stocks should deepen in the st quarter

Book Predicts Imminent Decline of World Oil Supplies Even though the world is now experiencing what appears to be an overabundance of oil with lowered demand and brimming inventories a new book Hubberts Peak The Impending World Oil Shortage advances the idea that crude oil supplies will peak within the next years then slowly begin to dwindle The book contends that the world will not be prepared to deal with the situation when the peak in production occurs The book says several events could zap supplies and create an energy crisis including a big war in the Middle East It points out that while there still may be a few huge oilfields left to discover most have or will shortly reach their maximum output level and begin to dry up According to the book most new discoveries since have been mediocre The book is based on theories by a geologist who accurately predicted in the mid s that US crude production would reach its zenith in The US now depends on imports for over half of its crude consumption Critics of the theory do not argue with the eventual outcome but they do argue that the timetable is too severe They acknowledge that there will be a day when the worlds oil output will start to shrivel but point out that improved technologies and economies will delay the decline Many believe that there is still sufficient oil supply in the Middle East but Western powers have imposed economic sanctions that have restricted its production In addition new technologies being developed will decrease demand expanding the timetable for the deterioration of oil supplies Detractors point to the increased usage of natural gas development of fuel cells conservation new methods that allow oil sands mining as well as solar wind and geothermal technologies will diminish

Merger Could Be Blocked Phillips and Conoco could face an unwelcome hurdle in their planned billion merger in the form of a competing bid from ChevronTexaco andor others The deal could be susceptible to intervention because Conoco shareholders would get little or no premium Conoco investors will get of a share in the new company for each of their shares Phillips investors will receive a oneonone swap A competing offer could lead to a bidding war since oil and natural gas prices are depressed It seems that Conoco could be an easier target for ChevronTexaco because a bid for Phillips large refining interests on the West Coast may raise antitrust concerns Shell which has been seeking to expand their natural gas assets in North America could also be interested in Conoco Conoco increased its natural gas reserves and production by through its acquisition of Gulf Canada Resources last July But acquisition of Phillips could be more attractive to TotalFinaElf and would present no antitrust difficulties because it has no oil refinery operations in the US However competing bidders could find themselves put off by a poison pill buried in the PhillipsConoco deal The companies included a million breakup fee if either company terminates the deal However that can be overcome if both are bought Also Phillips and Conoco tied up the industrys top advisers reducing the number of

by existing technology But he also pointed out that the panel said that CAFE has produced smaller and lighter cars resulting in more traffic deaths He said that the DOT is deeply concerned about the

Dec Alaskan Lawmakers Debate Oil and Natural Gas Subsidy Alaskan lawmakers are debating a bill which would expand a program that cuts the states share of oil and natural gas from some projects The bill would expand the discovery royalty credit program which currently applies only in Cook Inlet to the Tanana basin Critics of the measure do not think it provides an effective incentive and it costs the state money The program lowers Alaskas share of oil and natural gas royalties from the usual to which detractors say is a relatively small amount to those who would invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a project compared to other factors such as price They also say that Alaska lost million on the Redoubt Shoals project in Cook Inlet which had been planned before the incentive became available Backers of the Redoubt Shoals project argue that the incentive is effective in luring new investment because it allows companies to better manage risks Legislators that support the measure say they are very concerned about stimulating the economy in Alaska and say that if the program is available in Cook Inlet it should also apply to the Interior Another proposal House Bill which would extend the expiration date of an exploration incentive credit program from to passed with no trouble That program would allow the state to provide a credit of up to million per project for

the Senate have introduced legislation to raise vehicle fuel efficiency standards and close a loophole that allows SUVs to get lower gasoline mileage than cars The bill which aims to reduce dependence on foreign oil by cutting back on gasoline use would require the vehicle fleet to average miles per gallon by up from the current mpg Currently the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards require passenger cars to average mpg while sportutility vehicles along with minivans and other vehicles in the light truck category need get only mpg The proposed legislation would slowly increase the fuel efficiency of both cars and light trucks The CAFE standards would increase to mpg for cars and mpg for light trucks by and then jump to mpg for cars and mpg for light trucks in The legislation would combine the passenger car and light truck categories beginning with the model year However heavyduty pickup trucks are not included Gasoline demand accounts for of the million barrels of oil that is consumed daily in the American market Half of that oil is imported Raising the fuel standard would save million bpd by Republicans have come up with a competing CAFE plan that would require an average fuel economy for fleet of mpg by Higher fuel requirements would be phased in beginning with the model year That bill would combine light trucks and SUVs with passenger cars when calculating the fleets fuel economy thereby eliminating the SUV loophole It would also allow auto makers to trade greenhouse gas emission credits with other industries to help meet the higher CAFE requirements Auto makers say a significant boost in mileage requirements would force them to make more expensive lightweight vehicles that they claim would be less safe Whichever CAFE standard the Senate Committee approves will be included in a broad energy bill the Senate will begin debating this week However higher fuel requirements might not make it beyond the Senate floor if the parties are not able to resolve differences over both the CAFE standard and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge The Senate will also have to work out differences on energy policy with the House of Representatives The

OTC trading of derivatives Derivatives are customized financial contracts whose values are connected to the price of underlying commodities and are traded privately among companies not on regulated exchanges The proposed legislation is an attempt to eliminate a Congressional exemption that allowed energy traders to avoid scrutiny by the CFTC when trading derivatives The bill would give the CFTC regulatory oversight authority over futures trades without delivery of energy commodities in multilateral markets The FERC has said that it will investigate EnronOnline and other transactions by the company to determine if it was guilty of price gouging during Californias power crisis last year Western politicians have accused Enron of intentionally inflating wholesale power and natural gas prices during that period Some allege that the potential for market abuse has not disappeared with Enrons demise EnronOnline offered realtime markets for a number of commodities including OTC contracts for crude oil natural gas power and bandwidth Enron was either as a buyer or seller in all transactions According to testimony before Congress some have said that the combination of market information and market power gave Enron the opportunity to create selfserving price volatility and that UBS Warburg will now hold the same capability Others say it adds liquidity to the market Enrons former trading business began operating on Monday as UBSWenergycom The Democratic legislation may rekindle a debate over whether any federal oversight is necessary in the derivatives market The former head of the CFTC proposed such regulatory oversight a couple of years ago but the plan was rejected after pointed criticism from industries and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan The current head has told the House panel that the CFTC does not need additional regulatory authority because Enrons positions in the futures market were smoothly closed out after its bankruptcy IPE ARA Gas Oil

dollardenominated notes and million in eurodenominated notes The rating on the PDVSA Finance notes will depend on SPs assessment of changes in the level of sovereign risk and the extent to which the structure mitigates such sovereign risk While a downgrade of the sovereign would not trigger an automatic downgrade of PDVSA Finance the level of political control and influence of the government on PDVSA makes such an action likely On a separate note the recent news regarding the breach of contract brought claim against PDVSA by its joint venture partner Lyondell Chemical also underscores the sovereign risk inherent in public sector cross border future flow transactions SP is reviewing PDVSAs claim that the lawsuit will not have a have a material effect on it While the lawsuit was not the reason for the CreditWatch placement when reviewing sovereign risk for a structured transaction supported by governmentowned assets SP takes into consideration the public sector entitys unwillingness or inability to abide by its agreements or contracts because of shareholder pressure This is true for PDVSA Finance since as of December up to of the exports supporting PDVSA Finances debt were sold to wholly owned subsidiary CITGO Petroleum and a further were sold to joint venture partners SP believes that during a sovereign stress scenario there is a greater likelihood that PDVSA would violate its agreements and redirect export revenues from CITGO and to a lesser degree its joint venture partners than from nonaffiliated companies Also SP has been notified by PDVSA that it is planning to cut production in March which could reduce crude oil deliveries to its joint venture partners and other customers by as much as While the cuts are expected to lead to lower debt service coverage levels the extent of any reduction in coverage levels will depend on the effect the cuts have on future oil prices SP will continue to monitor coverage levels which although declining continue to be strong
