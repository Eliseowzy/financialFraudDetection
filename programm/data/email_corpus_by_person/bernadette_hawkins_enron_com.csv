Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm

further on our weekly Power Marketers conference call To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call If you have any questions please feel free to contact Erin Perrigo at or Report Summary Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the Report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to Californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity Coordinating and Controlling Outages The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement PGA with the ISO Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited Similarly the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation Selling Obligations All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO dayahead markets PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate FERC Staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed Price Mitigation When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or Stage emergencies the Report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced PGA until called upon to run Realtime Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs This price will be used by the ISO to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order Market Clearing Price All realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price Conditions for Invoking Mitigation Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies As noted in the Report Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the California market Among the purported difficulties Staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcity Suggested EPSA Comments EPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal however there are a few things we commend Namely the Staffs timely turnaround of the report as directed in the December Order their admission that the overarching problem cannot be solved by these shorterterm mitigation measures only by increased investments in infrastructure and recommendation of the single price auction in the realtime market noting that it should be used for only approximately five percent of the market Also to stress the importance of regulatory certainty the Report recommends a datecertain sunset for the mitigation approach of no more than one year Areas of concern include It is not acceptable to use a costbased model to explain what happens to prices in a shortage period The oil shortages of the s are a good illustration a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first quadrupling of oil prices from about to per barrel Similarly prices rose to in with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply Staffs proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not create a market clearing price in scarcity situations and does not take into account the customers value of the commodity To the extent sellers costs are used full costs are not included Staffs recommendation As outlined in EPSAs recently filed white paper on market monitoring full costs should include opportunity costs scarcity value capacity value and risk The Report fails to link high prices to any anticompetitive behavior yet still alleges such behavior throughout the Report EPSA opposes the forced bidding into the realtime market as recommended This prescription precludes and preempts competitive business decisions and retards the healthy development of the market The Reports method for calculating the market clearing price is not illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing price The method proposed in FERCs refund order of March th may be preferable to the method proposed in this Report Staffs method only includes participating generators and does not include imports and outofmarket purchases EPSA prefers a method that is more inclusive of details and characteristics of a true market

Summary Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the Report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to Californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity Coordinating and Controlling Outages The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement PGA with the ISO Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited Similarly the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation Selling Obligations All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO dayahead markets PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate FERC Staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed Price Mitigation When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or Stage emergencies the Report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced PGA until called upon to run Realtime Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs This price will be used by the ISO to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order Market Clearing Price All realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price Conditions for Invoking Mitigation Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies As noted in the Report Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the California market Among the purported difficulties Staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcity Suggested EPSA Comments EPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal however there are a few things

Forwarded by Bernadette HawkinsCorpEnron on PM Jackie Gallagher PM To cc Subject Commission Actions to Remove Obstacles in Western US Key Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH MEMORANDUM TO Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm relief could be included in federal legislation We will discuss this question as well To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call In the meantime if you have any questions please

Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Erin Perrigo Senior Manager of Policy DATE RE Summary of the FERC Staff Recommendation on California Market Monitoring and Mitigation and EPSA Comment Outline Pursuant to its December Order EL December Order FERC released its Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market Report issued March th addressing mitigation of price volatility in the California markets Comments on the Report are due on Thursday March nd The following is a summary of the Report along with an outline of possible EPSA comments We will discuss the report and EPSAs comments further on our weekly Power Marketers conference call To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call If you have any questions please feel free to contact Erin Perrigo at or Report Summary Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the Report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to Californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity Coordinating and Controlling Outages The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement PGA with the ISO Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited Similarly the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation Selling Obligations All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO dayahead markets PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate FERC Staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed Price Mitigation When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or Stage emergencies the Report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced PGA until called upon to run Realtime Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs This price will be used by the ISO to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order Market Clearing Price All realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price Conditions for Invoking Mitigation Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies As noted in the Report Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the California market Among the purported difficulties Staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcity Suggested EPSA Comments EPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal however there are a few things we commend Namely the Staffs timely turnaround of the report as directed in the December Order their admission that the overarching problem cannot be solved by these shorterterm mitigation measures only by increased investments in infrastructure and recommendation of the single price auction in the realtime market noting that it should be used for only approximately five percent of the market Also to stress the importance of regulatory certainty the Report recommends a datecertain sunset for the mitigation approach of no more than one year Areas of concern include It is not acceptable to use a costbased model to explain what happens to prices in a shortage period The oil shortages of the s are a good illustration a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first quadrupling of oil prices from about to per barrel Similarly prices rose to in with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply Staffs proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not create a market clearing price in scarcity situations and does not take into account the customers value of the commodity To the extent sellers costs are used full costs are not included Staffs recommendation As outlined in EPSAs recently filed white paper on market monitoring full costs should include opportunity costs scarcity value capacity value and risk The Report fails to link high prices to any anticompetitive behavior yet still alleges such behavior throughout the Report EPSA opposes the forced bidding into the realtime market as recommended This prescription precludes and preempts competitive business decisions and retards the healthy development of the market The Reports method for calculating the market clearing price is not illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing price The method proposed in FERCs refund order of March th may be preferable to the method proposed in this Report Staffs method only includes participating generators and does not include imports and outofmarket purchases EPSA prefers a method that is more inclusive of details and characteristics of a true market

Forwarded by Bernadette HawkinsCorpEnron on PM Jackie Gallagher PM To cc Subject Commission Actions to Remove Obstacles in Western US Key Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH MEMORANDUM TO Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm

DATE RE Summary of the FERC Staff Recommendation on California Market Monitoring and Mitigation and EPSA Comment Outline Pursuant to its December Order EL December Order FERC released its Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market Report issued March th addressing mitigation of price volatility in the California markets Comments on the Report are due on Thursday March nd The following is a summary of the Report along with an outline of possible EPSA comments We will discuss the report and EPSAs comments further on our weekly Power Marketers conference call To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call If you have any questions please feel free to contact Erin Perrigo at or Report Summary Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the Report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to Californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity Coordinating and Controlling Outages The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement PGA with the ISO Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited Similarly the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation Selling Obligations All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO dayahead markets PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate FERC Staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed Price Mitigation When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or Stage emergencies the Report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced PGA until called upon to run Realtime Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs This price will be used by the ISO to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order Market Clearing Price All realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price Conditions for Invoking Mitigation Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies As noted in the Report Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the California market Among the purported difficulties Staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcity Suggested EPSA Comments EPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal however there are a few things we commend Namely the Staffs timely turnaround of the report as directed in the December Order their admission that the overarching problem cannot be solved by these shorterterm mitigation measures only by increased investments in infrastructure and recommendation of the single price auction in the realtime market noting that it should be used for only approximately five percent of the market Also to stress the importance of regulatory certainty the Report recommends a datecertain sunset for the mitigation approach of no more than one year Areas of concern include It is not acceptable to use a costbased model to explain what happens to prices in a shortage period The oil shortages of the s are a good illustration a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first quadrupling of oil prices from about to per barrel Similarly prices rose to in with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply Staffs proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not create a market clearing price in scarcity situations and does not take into account the customers value of the commodity To the extent sellers costs are used full costs are not included Staffs recommendation As outlined in EPSAs recently filed white paper on market monitoring full costs should include opportunity costs scarcity value capacity value and risk The Report fails to link high prices to any anticompetitive behavior yet still alleges such behavior throughout the Report EPSA opposes the forced bidding into the realtime market as recommended This prescription precludes and preempts competitive business decisions and retards the healthy development of the market The Reports method for calculating the market clearing price is not illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing price The method proposed in FERCs refund order of March th may be preferable to the method proposed in this Report Staffs method only includes participating generators and does not include imports and outofmarket purchases EPSA prefers a method that is more inclusive of details and characteristics of a true market
