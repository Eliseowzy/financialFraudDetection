<28726971.1075861436559.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mwoita@home.com,2001-11-26 11:07:40,CarsHi Jim We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans a Toyota Sienna and a Chrysler Town Country Surprisingly Ben helped us eliminate SUVs from consideration He prefers the smoother ride of the minivan It will be better for taking long trips The down side is he doesnt want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns Ha We were able to help satisfy Anna and Ben by choosing a higherend minivan that has many bells and whistles on it yet still costs less than an SUV We are leaning toward the Toyota even though it is a bit smaller than the Chrysler because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value The Toyota dealer also has over invoice sale on currently Plus they told Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can choose from So we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday What do you think Love Linda PS We got a pkg in the mail today from you Thanks I will wait until the kids are here to open it
