<12698090.1075858735772.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dems-news@2001victory.com,2001-10-25 14:27:48,Whitman to Schundler Clean Up Your ActWHITMAN TO SCHUNDLER CLEAN UP YOUR ACT TRENTON Former Governor Christine Todd Whitman has had plenty to say about Republican gubernatorial candidate Bret Schundler She just hasnt had much to say lately But in the past she and her top advisors have been scathing critics of Mr Schundler So as she prepares to stand by his side tonight we thought it was time for a trip down memory lane Whitman vs Schundler the greatest hits Schundlers Payroll Tax The bloom was off the rose by December when Governor Whitman told Schundler she planned to block his attempts to enact a payroll tax in Jersey City because it was a really bad idea Jersey Citys growth and progress will be jeopardized by the enactment of a payroll tax Such a tax represents a substantial portion of the net income to a number of Jersey Citys corporations The tax could very well result in the departure of these companies from the city In addition to stifling the growth of such businesses such a tax would also hinder the States and Jersey Citys ability to compete for various other enterprises that are presently considering relocations to the city Accordingly the payroll tax could result in a contraction of Jersey Citys tax base rather than its expansion letter from Whitman Chief of Staff Peter Verniero to Schundler attached Of course Schundler went ahead and enacted his payroll tax anyway A court ruled his tax was illegal and ordered him to refund Jersey City businesses the million he had improperly collected Schundler waged a court battle for two years to defend his illegal tax for two years until the state Supreme Court finally turned him down Whitman slams Schundlers management of the city It was all downhill from there By late Governor Whitman took the gloves off and took her antiSchundler message directly to the people of Jersey City In a letter to Jersey City residents she explained that she would recommend a percent increase in Distressed Cities aid to Jersey City but that the city had some serious management problems In its fourmonth review the state Distressed Cities team has uncovered numerous instances of wasteful and inefficient spending in Jersey Citys budget expenses that cannot be justified with state aid I can assure you there is no need for the type of draconian actions being threatened by Mayor Schundler If the mayor acts responsibly the city will be largely unaffected by the proposed reductions letter from Gov Whitman to Jersey City residents attached Whitman administration accuses Schundler of wrong doing When Whitman put her key advisor DCA Commissioner Jane Kenny on the Schundler attack it got even worse In addition to possible irregularities in accounting practices and instances of noncompliance with statutory and regulatory law it is problematic that the elected officials would spend over a million dollars on personal charitable projects given the Citys significant financial problems and need for additional State aid annually to close its budget gap Our staff has been aware of the Citys practices for a short while and during that time has been researching and compiling data to substantiate our concerns on the legality and propriety of utilizing public funds in this manner Letter from DCA Commissioner Kenny to Jersey City resident attached We are keenly aware of the City manipulation of revenues and expenditures and what may be misrepresentations in its annual financial statements These issues will be factors in our consideration of special aid to the City for its SFY budget Letter from DCA Commissioner Kenny to Jersey City resident attached In the first phase of our review which was limited to an analysis of salary and operational costs our staff immediately found glaring examples of frivolous spending an example of which is taxpayer dollars buying specialty coffees for the Mayors offices There are several reasons why the City has been able to hold increases in local real estate taxes to an amount less than the increase in inflation The major factor is the use of oneshot revenues and new laws adopted to assist the City which permitted bulk lien sales and accelerated tax sales In addition State aid to the City has increased from million in FY to million in FY That does not include an additional million in special aid or millions of additional dollars in housing social services transportation and public safety grants You state that spending in the City also increased at a rate less than the increase in inflation during the current City administration Unfortunately this is an irrelevant issue because this was possible primarily as the result of shifting costs from the Citys budget to other governmental agencies For example the City shifted million in solid waste costs from the operating budget to the Municipal Utilities Authority Letter from DCA Commissioner Kenny to Hudson County Board of Realtors attached Whitman says Schundler is out of step with mainstream New Jersey Even after she left the Statehouse and left New Jersey Whitman kept up her assault I dont know that his positions are compatible with on some issues most of New Jerseyans who Whitman said tend to believe in a womans right to choose at least in the case of rape and incest
