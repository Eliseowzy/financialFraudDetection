Steve Huntoon who is now with Dynegys DC office Lisa Forwarded by Lisa YohoNAEnron on AM AM To cc Subject WPTF Friday Crazy About U Burrito Check out the end of the burrito THE FRIDAY BURRITO Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned t o Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustino v replied Those are our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descended upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe that one must do the same by following the money Im not talki ng about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at the centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we could figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send t hem some of our politicians a bipartisan group including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at al l by continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of Californ ia I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents o f the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips f rom the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the ground beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that neat or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corne r of th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free space shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chance to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push t he start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various pa rts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folks hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complet e strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt get any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown auth or of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means A nd the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That wa s news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers to additional electric generation in the West The Order admit s that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the right direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause ord er to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we mus t watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee wi ll have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoena individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million Q F purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totaling billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchas e defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billio n excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why woul d these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy T he Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twic e weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite on Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words The price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market prices I was surprised when I received the following email fro m BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs R ay Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California or that your traders should check that price before entering the market The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe en California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we intend to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the services of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Art er Hadden to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Furthe r excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our response in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal go t interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else kno w about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope you re having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying the Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I reall y got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only ar e they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How abou t Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company h as similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission and power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primarily by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate the electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets b y working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely

years first as a client for my over priced consulting services and later as a friend and source of all kinds of useful information Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a boatload of money However Hals company is developing some new projec ts and he is looking for prospective power buyers Hence his interest in WPTF is obvious Wellhead is WPTFs st member Well the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week They couldnt let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket that is a tribute to their creative skills Timely too Sing it to the tune of California Dreaming by the Mamas and the Papas ISO California to the tune of Hotel California On a dark Western highway No wind in my hair No rain for the hydro No NOX in the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a flickering sight The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim No relief in the night So we stood in the darkness Down at the Taco Bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven or this could be Hell We lit up a candle No power in the Bay There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say Welcome to the ISO California Such a lovely place Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Powering up for the ISO California What a nice surprise What a nice surprise Bring your alibis Its mind is policy twisted Cant stop consumption trends Got a lot of NIMBY boys Cisco calls

Steve Huntoon who is now with Dynegys DC office Lisa Forwarded by Lisa YohoNAEnron on AM AM To cc Subject WPTF Friday Crazy About U Burrito Check out the end of the burrito THE FRIDAY BURRITO Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned t o Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustino v replied Those are our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descended upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe that one must do the same by following the money Im not talki ng about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at the centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we could figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send t hem some of our politicians a bipartisan group including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at al l by continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of Californ ia I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents o f the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips f rom the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the ground beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that neat or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corne r of th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free space shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chance to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push t he start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various pa rts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folks hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complet e strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt get any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown auth or of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means A nd the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That wa s news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers to additional electric generation in the West The Order admit s that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the right direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause ord er to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we mus t watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee wi ll have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoena individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million Q F purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totaling billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchas e defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billio n excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why woul d these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy T he Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twic e weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite on Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words The price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market prices I was surprised when I received the following email fro m BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs R ay Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California or that your traders should check that price before entering the market The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe en California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we intend to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the services of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Art er Hadden to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Furthe r excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our response in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal go t interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else kno w about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope you re having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying the Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I reall y got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only ar e they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How abou t Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company h as similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission and power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primarily by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate the electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets b y working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and recommendations to clients Interested parties should

years first as a client for my over priced consulting services and later as a friend and source of all kinds of useful information Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a boatload of money However Hals company is developing some new projec ts and he is looking for prospective power buyers Hence his interest in WPTF is obvious Wellhead is WPTFs st member Well the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week They couldnt let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket that is a tribute to their creative skills Timely too Sing it to the tune of California Dreaming by the Mamas and the Papas ISO California to the tune of Hotel California On a dark Western highway No wind in my hair No rain for the hydro No NOX in the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a flickering sight The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim No relief in the night So we stood in the darkness Down at the Taco Bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven

Steve Huntoon who is now with Dynegys DC office Lisa Forwarded by Lisa YohoNAEnron on AM AM To cc Subject WPTF Friday Crazy About U Burrito Check out the end of the burrito THE FRIDAY BURRITO Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned t o Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustino v replied Those are our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descended upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe that one must do the same by following the money Im not talki ng about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at the centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we could figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send t hem some of our politicians a bipartisan group including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at al l by continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of Californ ia I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents o f the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips f rom the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the ground beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that neat or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corne r of th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free space shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chance to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push t he start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various pa rts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folks hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complet e strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt get any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown auth or of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means A nd the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That wa s news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers to additional electric generation in the West The Order admit s that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the right direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause ord er to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we mus t watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee wi ll have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoena individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million Q F purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totaling billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchas e defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billio n excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why woul d these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy T he Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twic e weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite on Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words The price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market prices I was surprised when I received the following email fro m BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs R ay Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California or that your traders should check that price before entering the market The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe en California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we intend to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the services of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Art er Hadden to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Furthe r excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our response in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal go t interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else kno w about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope you re having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying the Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I reall y got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only ar e they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How abou t Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company h as similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission and power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primarily by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate the electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets b y working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and recommendations to clients Interested parties should contact Jolly Hayden at Odds Ends First I would like to welcome WPTFs newest general member Wellhead Electric Hal Dittmer is the founder and president of Wellhead I h ave known Hal for a couple of years first as a client for my over priced consulting services and later as a friend and source of all kinds of useful information Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a boatload of money However Hals company is developing some new projec ts and he is looking for prospective power buyers Hence his interest in WPTF is obvious Wellhead is WPTFs st member Well the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week They couldnt let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket that is a tribute to their creative skills Timely too Sing it to the tune of California Dreaming by the Mamas and the Papas ISO California to the tune of Hotel California On a dark Western highway No wind in my hair No rain for the hydro No NOX in the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a flickering sight The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim No relief in the night So we stood in the darkness Down at the Taco Bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven or this could be Hell We lit up a candle No power in the Bay There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say Welcome to the ISO California Such a lovely place Such a lovely place Such a

Steve Huntoon who is now with Dynegys DC office Lisa Forwarded by Lisa YohoNAEnron on AM AM To cc Subject WPTF Friday Crazy About U Burrito Check out the end of the burrito THE FRIDAY BURRITO Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned t o Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustino v replied Those are our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descended upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe that one must do the same by following the money Im not talki ng about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at the centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we could figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send t hem some of our politicians a bipartisan group including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at al l by continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of Californ ia I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents o f the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips f rom the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the ground beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that neat or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corne r of th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free space shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chance to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push t he start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various pa rts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folks hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complet e strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt get any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown auth or of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means A nd the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That wa s news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers to additional electric generation in the West The Order admit s that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the right direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause ord er to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we mus t watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee wi ll have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoena individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million Q F purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totaling billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchas e defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billio n excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why woul d these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy T he Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twic e weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite on Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words The price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market prices I was surprised when I received the following email fro m BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs R ay Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California or that your traders should check that price before entering the market The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe en California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we intend to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the services of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Art er Hadden to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Furthe r excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our response in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal go t interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else kno w about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope you re having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying the Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I reall y got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only ar e they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How abou t Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company h as similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission and power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primarily by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate the electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets b y working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely

Steve Huntoon who is now with Dynegys DC office Lisa Forwarded by Lisa YohoNAEnron on AM AM To cc Subject WPTF Friday Crazy About U Burrito Check out the end of the burrito THE FRIDAY BURRITO Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in the good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned t o Dmitri Ustinov the Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustino v replied Those are our economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential This is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descended upon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where Aliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in Sacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe that one must do the same by following the money Im not talki ng about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It was a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks kind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his speech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at the centre English and Eh One night in the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank Wolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget largess build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we could figure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to counterattack Well send t hem some of our politicians a bipartisan group including a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board Speaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO words such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl Imparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We arent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite conversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement because the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some members of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are Mr President is not helping us at al l by continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr President Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS detector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California ISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head Not all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of Californ ia I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board meeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each traders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to use it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents o f the coffee are in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine and the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips f rom the spout into a waiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the ground beans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that neat or what I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine but a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corne r of th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free space shuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chance to visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push t he start button and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already there and quite enlarged Back to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew and its leaders Each electric trading desk for various pa rts of the country is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a person doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at am Houston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folks hadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk Captain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave Francis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on vacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain worked it like a maestro During my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complet e strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt get any better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown auth or of Lake Woebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an audience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means A nd the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are those California people really that crazy Since last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up somewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That wa s news worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers to additional electric generation in the West The Order admit s that it wont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the right direction The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause ord er to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of That is a serious case that we mus t watch closely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own investigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee wi ll have subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoena individuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me Thursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step one of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy people Lets see what else we can talk about Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities Be a Source for Energy Price Update BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds Ends DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDD Things in the Peoples Republic of California PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities Rate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although the text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as of March the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE The PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million Q F purchases increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO payments increased million now totaling billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million PGEs total default amount is now billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE customers for DWR purchases The SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March increased by million since January for a total default amount of million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm debt principal and interest roughly million QF purchas e defaults increased by million for the same fiveweek period now totaling million The ISO obligations decreased million and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased million now totaling million SCEs total default amount is now billio n excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time In the last five weeks between January and March the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased million The total QF default for both utilities as of March stands at billion Does anyone wonder why MW of QF capacity has shut down in California Without these payments being made very soon I would expect the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why woul d these projects produce without the promise of being paid Things in the Peoples Republic of California Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy T he Survey is a regular feature in CEM The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources Pricewaterhouse Coopers BPAs daily offerings for instance It is written up in narrative form The report goes out twic e weekly once on Wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite on Friday that is emailed around am posted on the newsdatacom Web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words The price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number eg McGrawHills Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades but rather questions like Whats MidColumbia going for today What about offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is that Anything else I should know The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts send back a copy of the Constitution contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists and start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees If you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at Things in the Peoples Republic of California BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market prices I was surprised when I received the following email fro m BPAs David Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs R ay Hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying Dear Ray As per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California or that your traders should check that price before entering the market The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe en California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly MWhr with MidC being lower than the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA Things FERC Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously and we intend to provide comments on March If you are interested in a copy of the report go to bulkpowerbulkpowerhtm General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response We have retained the services of Dr Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues He will be working with our counsel Dan Douglass of Art er Hadden to craft our reply In short our submission will point out the flaws in FERCs proposed methodology and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost Furthe r excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the FERC analysis Next week I will include a short summary of our response in the Burrito Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and then I dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load under a CPUC rate schedule because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec order to schedule of its load in the day ahead market according to Universal if SCE had done so then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost SCE didnt and Universal go t interrupted and now Universal owes Does anyone else kno w about this filing Lind Guerry veteran of the PX halcyon days wrote Hi Gary Hope you re having a nice day Just wanted to let you know that Im really enjoying the Burrito and am so glad youre sending it to my home email I reall y got a kick out of the Ten Reasons Its hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands isnt it And not only ar e they incompetent they continue to remain so with such regularity you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative Do you think if we tried to do that wed get accused of exercising market power Think of the power wed wield as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence Lind we need a product name for the laxative idea Any ideas How abou t Sane Away Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings If your company h as similar posting or job openings or if you are reader looking for a new gig drop me a line After all its free Position Description Dynegys position has responsibility for the development of transmission and power markets in a geographic region of the US Duties are driven primarily by federal regional and state activities to restructure and deregulate the electric power industry and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures policies and regulations that promote liquid and

establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations Extensive travel and higher at times is highly probable Primary goals of this position are to Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets b y working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities and Provide timely and accurate information market intelligence and recommendations to clients Maximize the value of Dynegys positions and assets by working closely

the steel study tomorrow when I receive it Thanks Lisa Chris Long AM To Lisa nron Linda NRON Richard nron cc Subject Wall St Journal Lisa Please get this to Jeff McMahon and the steel group Below are two press reports on the CITAC the coalition we joined to fight study on the effects of steel import quotas We will use this as a basis for lobbying campaign over the next month I will send you a copy of the study overnight Thanks Chris Look on p A of the Wall StJournal Both articles are attached April Economy Consuming Group Attacks Effort By Steelmakers to Curb Imports By ROBERT GUY MATTHEWS Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A grassroots organization of consuming industries is mounting a campaign to stop the steel industrys relentless push to sharply limit the amount of cheap foreign steel allowed into the country a move currently being considered by President Bush Monday the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition wwwcitactradeorg is expected to release a report that says that five times as many jobs will be lost in steelconsuming industries as would be saved in the steelmaking industry if quotas are passed The report also says that import limits would drive up the costs of steel and force steel users such as those serving the household appliance construction automobile machinery and equipment industry to lay off workers and cut production The thing to think about here is to look at when Washington is protecting the narrow interests of one industry they dont always see the broader perspective said Jon Jensen chairman of Citac But steelmakers and steel unions counter that the consuming industries have long enjoyed a period of extremely low steel prices and that it is unfair to expect the steel producers to continue to bear the brunt just to keep steel costs low Hotrolled and coldrolled steel two of the most widely used steel products have seen their prices plunge to some of their lowest prices in decades at the same time consuming industries have been able to increase production hire more employees and lower the costs of goods because of a rapid fall in steel prices We have in this country bad trade policy says Leo Gerard president of the United Steelworkers of America Clearly there are groups that are taking advantage of this unfair trade policy and we are mounting a campaign to stop this abuse There has always been tension between the steel industry and the users of steel with each side wanting the other to be less demanding about prices and supply But the acrimony has increased in recent months as the steel industry suffers through a long string of quarterly losses eroding market share because of increased availability of foreign steel which is often cheaper and seemingly endless in supply In the past two years about steelmakers have filed for Chapter bankruptcycourt protection The steel industry has pushed for import quotas with its powerful steel lobbyists in Washington Elected officials from steelproducing states have also turned up the heat for protections to the industry The Bush administration has indicated that it would support a three to fiveyear moratorium on foreign steel imports for many steel products that are domestically made if the steel industry agrees to consolidate and reorganize in order to become more competitive both in the domestic and international markets Feeling outpowered the consuming industries a loose band of mostly small nonunion companies including Stamco Industries Inc of Euclid Ohio and All American Mfg Co of Los Angeles formed Citac nearly two years ago to push their agenda and show that there are more users of steel than makers of steel Absent from the group are big appliance makers and automotive customers although those customers too are against allowing additional quotas on imports The report says that if the most drastic of several import quota plans were to be implemented about steel jobs would be protected But to jobs in the steelconsuming sectors would be lost The report also says that the average pay for these lost steel consuming jobs is about an hour Keith Busse chief executive officer of Steel Dynamics Inc based in Butler Ind criticized the report and the effort to keep additional import quotas from becoming law Its ridiculous for these guys to want to continue to see the domestic steel industry to suffer We depend on each other he says Write to Robert Guy Matthews at mailto Steel users assert quotas would cost jobs By Nancy E Kelly WASHINGTON April Steel users struck a blow against agitated suppliers seeking import restraints on foreign steel by funding a study on job losses under several import policies The report concluded that quotas would result in three times as many steelconsuming industry workers losing their jobs as would be protected in steel manufacturing Funded by a foundation affiliate of the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition CITAC Costs to American Consuming Industries of Steel Quotas and Taxes was written by the Trade Partnership a Washington research group CITAC members include a number of large steel consumers and associations including Caterpillar Inc Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America Inc Nissan North America Inc the American Wire Producers Association the International Association of Drilling Contractors the Precision Metalforming Association and the American Institute for International Steel The page report to be formally unveiled at a Washington press conference Monday based its findings on a stateoftheart econometric model to determine the costs to steelusing industries and consumers if the Steel Revitalization Act HR were passed into law The bill backed by the United Steelworkers union includes an import rollback to an average of levels between and an expansion of the billion steel loan guarantee program to billion a percent tax on all steel sold in the United States and a grant incentive program for merged steel companies to maintain employment levels The model also was used to determine the sole costs of quotas alone According to its findings The steel bill would protect no more than steel jobs in contrast to a loss of between and jobs in steelconsuming sectors Quotas outlined in the bill would cost tax consumers billion to billion annually or per job protected in the steel industry Quotas alone would result in two to three times as many workers in steelconsuming industries losing their jobs as would be protected upstream in the steel industry Quotas alone would cost consumers from billion to billion annually or as much as per steel job protected Asked about the ultimate costs to consuming industries if the domestic steel industry was substantially reduced Laura M Baughman who authored the study with Joseph F Francois said that CITAC wanted a healthy domestic steel industry CITAC is not for putting the domestic steel industry out of business but they dont think import quotas are the answer she said Imports are not the problemother things are the problem The study said that technology was driving the longterm change in the industry while the steel ranks had been blaming other factors including imports Asked why modern efficient minimills like Nucor Corp and Steel Dynamics Inc also were citing imports as the cause of severe pricing declines Baughman had no hard answer I find that very sad she said These are companies that understand the value of imports to the US economy and have relied on imports themselves for raw materials I dont know Baughman emphasized that the Trade Partnership had no political agenda and defended the model as rigorous and not easily manipulated Its a model that takes into account the entire economy and the effects on everything from agriculture to banking in a change on steel imports using basic input and outputs she said

ISSN X Regulation Law Economics International Trade Rockefeller Asks Senate Finance to Act Against Steel Imports Under Section Sen John D Rockefeller DWVa said May that he has asked the Senate Finance Committee to take action that could prompt the United States to restrict imports of steel from other countriesa move likely to be supported by the secondranking Republican on the committee but opposed by its chairman Saying he is running out of patience with the Bush administration Rockefellor told reporters he has asked the committee to urge the US International Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the cause of rising steel imports which could result in President Bushs temporarily imposing import restrictions against the European Union Japan South Korea and other countries under Section of the Trade Act Ive written the Finance Committee he said asking for the initiation of a Section Earlier this month Rockefeller wrote President Bush asking him to initiate an ITC investigation under Section noting that several US steel companies had reported substantial losses in the first quarter of this year I am writing to let you know that we are in a doordie situation Rockefeller wrote Failure to act now will be deadly The only immediate relief for the steel crisis is for you to initiate action under Section Rockefeller said May he also plans to introduce broader legislation May aimed at providing relief to the US steel industry He did not rule out eventually attaching the measure to the tax bill now working its way through Congress but said Let me get it introduced first Bush Nominee Notes Possible Action Earlier May President Bushs nominee for a deputy US trade representative slot Peter Allgeier said at a confirmation hearing of the Senate Finance Committee that the Bush administration was looking very very seriously at possible action under Section I would like to assure you that the administration is looking very very seriously at the issue of a possible as part of our response to a very urgent problem Allgeier said US Trade Representative Robert B Zoellick has provided members of Congress with similar assurances on several occasions since taking office earlier this year On May for instance he told a House Appropriations subcommittee that a decision on possible Section safeguard action should be made within a matter of months or sooner For his part Sen Charles F Grassley RIowa who chairs the committee said he would be reluctant to support committee action on the issue I would be reluctant to do that he said I think our committee ought to be seen as honest brokers in that effort Grassley told reporters he has been approached by outside interests that have urged him to back a committee request to the ITC on steel imports My message to them has been to work through the administration or file your own private action he said Sen Orrin G Hatch RUtah ranking Republican on the committee said he would probably support Rockefellers plan for the committee to selfinitiate action under Section I dont want to be unfair to other countries Hatch told reporters but I sure as heck dont want them to be unfair to us either I want the administration to be on notice that were watching them Senate Letter on AD CVD Laws Grassley meanwhile told reporters he did not sign the letter from senators to President Bush earlier this month saying they will oppose any international trade agreement that would weaken US laws aimed at protecting the US market from unfair imports or unexpected import surges because a worldwide discussion of antidumping practices for instance would benefit the United States more than it would benefit other countries He said he opposes efforts being made by some members of Congress to require the Bush administration to ensure that US antidumping and countervailing duty laws were off the table in multilateral trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization I dont think we have anything to fear having it on the table Grassley said Some countries such as South Korea and Japan argue that US trade laws have been used for protectionist purposes and have proposed revisiting the issue in the WTO Allgeier meanwhile said that US trade laws actually promote trade liberalization American manufacturers farmers and workers will feel more confident with trade negotiations if they feel that they have recourse to address these unfair trade practices by our trading partners he said And so we do not have any intention of weakening US trade remedy laws in our negotiations Allgeier said that the United States cannot prevent other countries from bringing up the issue in trade talks Little Progress Made on TPA Grassley also told reporters May he hopes that the Senate Finance Committee will be able to consider and approve legislation next month to renew the presidents trade promotion authority formerly known as fast track But he said that little progress has been made in discussions between his staff and the staff of Sen Max S Baucus DMont the ranking Democrat on the committee particularly concerning the contentious issue of labor and environmental protection in the context of trade agreements Our staffs have been talking on a very regular basis Grassley said but thats not to say that theres been progress made He said however he was still hopeful that the legislation could be cleared by the end of June then approved by the full Senate before the next ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization scheduled to be held in Qatar Nov Also testifying at the Finance Committee hearing on May President Bushs nominee for US ambassador to the WTO Linnet F Deily said that if confirmed she plans to begin meeting immediately with representatives of other WTO member countries in Geneva hoping to build relationships based on trust and candor I look forward to working with other WTO members to try and find common ground or reconcile our disparate positions while always representing the strength of the US position she said I would like to understand other perspectives while being a forceful advocate for our US positions By Gary G Yerkey

Lisa Subject RE Derivatives Advice on PRC Thanks Amy This is a useful analysis I sympathize with your comments re quality but Im afraid you will see similar weaknesses in the work of other firms Your question about financially settled transactions is on point Can you draft a question that would close that loop That way we can avoid this problem going forward Your summary did leave me with a couple of questions Does the advice indicate which PRC agency will regulate futures trading Is the advice on liquid fuels adequate for physically settled transactions aside from the dumping issue If not how can the initial memo be improved to prevent that in the future Are you comfortable that Enron could trade derivatives if the gambling question is resolved or is it too vague to rely on at all Can you offer an opinion on the insolvencynetting advice Ditto on the stamp duty Thanks Mike Original Message From Kim Amy Sent Friday August AM To Grimes Michael Cc Yoho Lisa Subject Derivatives Advice on PRC Mike Today is my first day back from surgery I am going to leave early and stay home tomorrow to recover Doctors orders I have reviewed the due diligence completed by the local counsel in China in Below you will find a summary of the due diligence as well as my opinion of its reliability and its applicability to trading other physical commodities To reiterate a point made the the local counsel the PRC government is taking strict control over financial futures which includes transactions traded through a trading exchange Therefore derivative transactions in this due diligence does not include financial futures China trade regime is very nontransparent There are still substantial trade barriers in place to consider Import barriers and opaque and inconsistent legal system and limitations on market access combine to make it difficult for foreign firms to do business in China Summary First of all the due diligence composed by the local counsel is quite difficult to follow even when guided by an index The organization of the due diligence needs work It also bothers me that the local counsel does not seem to commit to some of their answers eg We do not think My feeling is that as Chinese nationals these attorneys should be very familiar with their own laws and confident with their advice to foreigners Furthermore the position that the local counsel takes on this due diligence comes from a strict legal standpoint They do not seem to take into consideration the side of the corporation ie Enron The questions that keeps popping into my mind are whether or not the various laws and ordinances regulating the petroleum business in China apply if the transactions are financially settled only and Will the Chinese Court conclude that a derivaties contract constitutes a gambling contract Also the local counsel should have addressed the various laws for commodity products transactions The local counsel should have applied the Commodities Exchange Law Financial Futures Transaction Law Bank and Securities Laws Foreign Exchange Foreign Trade Law Law on Consignment and other Issues of Foreign Transactions in Foreign Commodity Markets and Insurance Business Law as well as any articles related to physical trading licensing banking activies facilities market prohibitions gambling and insurance regulations Finally noticeable absent from the due diligence is any mention of antidumping measures China first promulgated Antidumping and Antisubsidy Regulations in applying antidumping measure to newsprint steel and chemical products From a regulatory standpoint whether or not a country has CVDAD is of great importance All in all I cannot recommend that we rely on the financial derivative advice as provided by local counsel The due diligence is incomplete since it does not cover commodity products as a whole Therefore the advice on liquid fuels is not applicable to trading in other physical products A fullblown due diligence needs to be done in China on commodity products as a whole Regards Amy Kim Sr Specialist Regulatory x

ISSN X Regulation Law Economics International Trade Rockefeller Asks Senate Finance to Act Against Steel Imports Under Section Sen John D Rockefeller DWVa said May that he has asked the Senate Finance Committee to take action that could prompt the United States to restrict imports of steel from other countriesa move likely to be supported by the secondranking Republican on the committee but opposed by its chairman Saying he is running out of patience with the Bush administration Rockefellor told reporters he has asked the committee to urge the US International Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the cause of rising steel imports which could result in President Bushs temporarily imposing import restrictions against the European Union Japan South Korea and other countries under Section of the Trade Act Ive written the Finance Committee he said asking for the initiation of a Section Earlier this month Rockefeller wrote President Bush asking him to initiate an ITC investigation under Section noting that several US steel companies had reported substantial losses in the first quarter of this year I am writing to let you know that we are in a doordie situation Rockefeller wrote Failure to act now will be deadly The only immediate relief for the steel crisis is for you to initiate action under Section Rockefeller said May he also plans to introduce broader legislation May aimed at providing relief to the US steel industry He did not rule out eventually attaching the measure to the tax bill now working its way through Congress but said Let me get it introduced first Bush Nominee Notes Possible Action Earlier May President Bushs nominee for a deputy US trade representative slot Peter Allgeier said at a confirmation hearing of the Senate Finance Committee that the Bush administration was looking very very seriously at possible action under Section I would like to assure you that the administration is looking very very seriously at the issue of a possible as part of our response to a very urgent problem Allgeier said US Trade Representative Robert B Zoellick has provided members of Congress with similar assurances on several occasions since taking office earlier this year On May for instance he told a House Appropriations subcommittee that a decision on possible Section safeguard action should be made within a matter of months or sooner For his part Sen Charles F Grassley RIowa who chairs the committee said he would be reluctant to support committee action on the issue I would be reluctant to do that he said I think our committee ought to be seen as honest brokers in that effort Grassley told reporters he has been approached by outside interests that have urged him to back a committee request to the ITC on steel imports My message to them has been to work through the administration or file your own private action he said Sen Orrin G Hatch RUtah ranking Republican on the committee said he would probably support Rockefellers plan for the committee to selfinitiate action under Section I dont want to be unfair to other countries Hatch told reporters but I sure as heck dont want them to be unfair to us either I want the administration to be on notice that were watching them Senate Letter on AD CVD Laws Grassley meanwhile told reporters he did not sign the letter from senators to President Bush earlier this month saying they will oppose any international trade agreement that would weaken US laws aimed at protecting the US market from unfair imports or unexpected import surges because a worldwide discussion of antidumping practices for instance would benefit the United States more than it would benefit other countries He said he opposes efforts being made by some members of Congress to require the Bush administration to ensure that US antidumping and countervailing duty laws were off the table in multilateral trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization I dont think we have anything to fear having it on the table Grassley said Some countries such as South Korea and Japan argue that US trade laws have been used for protectionist purposes and have proposed revisiting the issue in the WTO Allgeier meanwhile said that US trade laws actually promote trade liberalization American manufacturers farmers and workers will feel more confident with trade negotiations if they feel that they have recourse to address these unfair trade practices by our trading partners he said And so we do not have any intention of weakening US trade remedy laws in our negotiations Allgeier said that the United States cannot prevent other countries from bringing up the issue in trade talks Little Progress Made on TPA Grassley also told reporters May he hopes that the Senate Finance Committee will be able to consider and approve legislation next month to renew the presidents trade promotion authority formerly known as fast track But he said that little progress has been made in discussions between his staff and the staff of Sen Max S Baucus DMont the ranking Democrat on the committee particularly concerning the contentious issue of labor and environmental protection in the context of trade agreements Our staffs have been talking on a very regular basis Grassley said but thats not to say that theres been progress made He said however he was still hopeful that the legislation could be cleared by the end of June then approved by the full Senate before the next ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization scheduled to be held in Qatar Nov Also testifying at the Finance Committee hearing on May President Bushs nominee for US ambassador to the WTO Linnet F Deily said that if confirmed she plans to begin meeting immediately with representatives of other WTO member countries in Geneva hoping to build relationships based on trust and candor I look forward to working with other WTO members to try and find common ground or reconcile our disparate positions while always representing the strength of the US position she said I would like to understand other perspectives while being a forceful advocate for our US positions By Gary G Yerkey

ISSN X Regulation Law Economics International Trade Rockefeller Asks Senate Finance to Act Against Steel Imports Under Section Sen John D Rockefeller DWVa said May that he has asked the Senate Finance Committee to take action that could prompt the United States to restrict imports of steel from other countriesa move likely to be supported by the secondranking Republican on the committee but opposed by its chairman Saying he is running out of patience with the Bush administration Rockefellor told reporters he has asked the committee to urge the US International Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the cause of rising steel imports which could result in President Bushs temporarily imposing import restrictions against the European Union Japan South Korea and other countries under Section of the Trade Act Ive written the Finance Committee he said asking for the initiation of a Section Earlier this month Rockefeller wrote President Bush asking him to initiate an ITC investigation under Section noting that several US steel companies had reported substantial losses in the first quarter of this year I am writing to let you know that we are in a doordie situation Rockefeller wrote Failure to act now will be deadly The only immediate relief for the steel crisis is for you to initiate action under Section Rockefeller said May he also plans to introduce broader legislation May aimed at providing relief to the US steel industry He did not rule out eventually attaching the measure to the tax bill now working its way through Congress but said Let me get it introduced first Bush Nominee Notes Possible Action Earlier May President Bushs nominee for a deputy US trade representative slot Peter Allgeier said at a confirmation hearing of the Senate Finance Committee that the Bush administration was looking very very seriously at possible action under Section I would like to assure you that the administration is looking very very seriously at the issue of a possible as part of our response to a very urgent problem Allgeier said US Trade Representative Robert B Zoellick has provided members of Congress with similar assurances on several occasions since taking office earlier this year On May for instance he told a House Appropriations subcommittee that a decision on possible Section safeguard action should be made within a matter of months or sooner For his part Sen Charles F Grassley RIowa who chairs the committee said he would be reluctant to support committee action on the issue I would be reluctant to do that he said I think our committee ought to be seen as honest brokers in that effort Grassley told reporters he has been approached by outside interests that have urged him to back a committee request to the ITC on steel imports My message to them has been to work through the administration or file your own private action he said Sen Orrin G Hatch RUtah ranking Republican on the committee said he would probably support Rockefellers plan for the committee to selfinitiate action under Section I dont want to be unfair to other countries Hatch told reporters but I sure as heck dont want them to be unfair to us either I want the administration to be on notice that were watching them Senate Letter on AD CVD Laws Grassley meanwhile told reporters he did not sign the letter from senators to President Bush earlier this month saying they will oppose any international trade agreement that would weaken US laws aimed at protecting the US market from unfair imports or unexpected import surges because a worldwide discussion of antidumping practices for instance would benefit the United States more than it would benefit other countries He said he opposes efforts being made by some members of Congress to require the Bush administration to ensure that US antidumping and countervailing duty laws were off the table in multilateral trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization I dont think we have anything to fear having it on the table Grassley said Some countries such as South Korea and Japan argue that US trade laws have been used for protectionist purposes and have proposed revisiting the issue in the WTO Allgeier meanwhile said that US trade laws actually promote trade liberalization American manufacturers farmers and workers will feel more confident with trade negotiations if they feel that they have recourse to address these unfair trade practices by our trading partners he said And so we do not have any intention of weakening US trade remedy laws in our negotiations Allgeier said that the United States cannot prevent other countries from bringing up the issue in trade talks Little Progress Made on TPA Grassley also told reporters May he hopes that the Senate Finance Committee will be able to consider and approve legislation next month to renew the presidents trade promotion authority formerly known as fast track But he said that little progress has been made in discussions between his staff and the staff of Sen Max S Baucus DMont the ranking Democrat on the committee particularly concerning the contentious issue of labor and environmental protection in the context of trade agreements Our staffs have been talking on a very regular basis Grassley said but thats not to say that theres been progress made He said however he was still hopeful that the legislation could be cleared by the end of June then approved by the full Senate before the next ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization scheduled to be held in Qatar Nov Also testifying at the Finance Committee hearing on May President Bushs nominee for US ambassador to the WTO Linnet F Deily said that if confirmed she plans to begin meeting immediately with representatives of other WTO member countries in Geneva hoping to build relationships based on trust and candor I look forward to working with other WTO members to try and find common ground or reconcile our disparate positions while always representing the strength of the US position she said I would like to understand other perspectives while being a forceful advocate for our US positions By Gary G Yerkey

the steel study tomorrow when I receive it Thanks Lisa Chris Long AM To Lisa nron Linda NRON Richard nron cc Subject Wall St Journal Lisa Please get this to Jeff McMahon and the steel group Below are two press reports on the CITAC the coalition we joined to fight study on the effects of steel import quotas We will use this as a basis for lobbying campaign over the next month I will send you a copy of the study overnight Thanks Chris Look on p A of the Wall StJournal Both articles are attached April Economy Consuming Group Attacks Effort By Steelmakers to Curb Imports By ROBERT GUY MATTHEWS Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A grassroots organization of consuming industries is mounting a campaign to stop the steel industrys relentless push to sharply limit the amount of cheap foreign steel allowed into the country a move currently being considered by President Bush Monday the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition wwwcitactradeorg is expected to release a report that says that five times as many jobs will be lost in steelconsuming industries as would be saved in the steelmaking industry if quotas are passed The report also says that import limits would drive up the costs of steel and force steel users such as those serving the household appliance construction automobile machinery and equipment industry to lay off workers and cut production The thing to think about here is to look at when Washington is protecting the narrow interests of one industry they dont always see the broader perspective said Jon Jensen chairman of Citac But steelmakers and steel unions counter that the consuming industries have long enjoyed a period of extremely low steel prices and that it is unfair to expect the steel producers to continue to bear the brunt just to keep steel costs low Hotrolled and coldrolled steel two of the most widely used steel products have seen their prices plunge to some of their lowest prices in decades at the same time consuming industries have been able to increase production hire more employees and lower the costs of goods because of a rapid fall in steel prices We have in this country bad trade policy says Leo Gerard president of the United Steelworkers of America Clearly there are groups that are taking advantage of this unfair trade policy and we are mounting a campaign to stop this abuse There has always been tension between the steel industry and the users of steel with each side wanting the other to be less demanding about prices and supply But the acrimony has increased in recent months as the steel industry suffers through a long string of quarterly losses eroding market share because of increased availability of foreign steel which is often cheaper and seemingly endless in supply In the past two years about steelmakers have filed for Chapter bankruptcycourt protection The steel industry has pushed for import quotas with its powerful steel lobbyists in Washington Elected officials from steelproducing states have also turned up the heat for protections to the industry The Bush administration has indicated that it would support a three to fiveyear moratorium on foreign steel imports for many steel products that are domestically made if the steel industry agrees to consolidate and reorganize in order to become more competitive both in the domestic and international markets Feeling outpowered the consuming industries a loose band of mostly small nonunion companies including Stamco Industries Inc of Euclid Ohio and All American Mfg Co of Los Angeles formed Citac nearly two years ago to push their agenda and show that there are more users of steel than makers of steel Absent from the group are big appliance makers and automotive customers although those customers too are against allowing additional quotas on imports The report says that if the most drastic of several import quota plans were to be implemented about steel jobs would be protected But to jobs in the steelconsuming sectors would be lost The report also says that the average pay for these lost steel consuming jobs is about an hour Keith Busse chief executive officer of Steel Dynamics Inc based in Butler Ind criticized the report and the effort to keep additional import quotas from becoming law Its ridiculous for these guys to want to continue to see the domestic steel industry to suffer We depend on each other he says Write to Robert Guy Matthews at mailto Steel users assert quotas would cost jobs By Nancy E Kelly WASHINGTON April Steel users struck a blow against agitated suppliers seeking import restraints on foreign steel by funding a study on job losses under several import policies The report concluded that quotas would result in three times as many steelconsuming industry workers losing their jobs as would be protected in steel manufacturing Funded by a foundation affiliate of the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition CITAC Costs to American Consuming Industries of Steel Quotas and Taxes was written by the Trade Partnership a Washington research group CITAC members include a number of large steel consumers and associations including Caterpillar Inc Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America Inc Nissan North America Inc the American Wire Producers Association the International Association of Drilling Contractors the Precision Metalforming Association and the American Institute for International Steel The page report to be formally unveiled at a Washington press conference Monday based its findings on a stateoftheart econometric model to determine the costs to steelusing industries and consumers if the Steel Revitalization Act HR were passed into law The bill backed by the United Steelworkers union includes an import rollback to an average of levels between and an expansion of the billion steel loan guarantee program to billion a percent tax on all steel sold in the United States and a grant incentive program for merged steel companies to maintain employment levels The model also was used to determine the sole costs of quotas alone According to its findings The steel bill would protect no more than steel jobs in contrast to a loss of between and jobs in steelconsuming sectors Quotas outlined in the bill would cost tax consumers billion to billion annually or per job protected in the steel industry Quotas alone would result in two to three times as many workers in steelconsuming industries losing their jobs as would be protected upstream in the steel industry Quotas alone would cost consumers from billion to billion annually or as much as per steel job protected Asked about the ultimate costs to consuming industries if the domestic steel industry was substantially reduced Laura M Baughman who authored the study with Joseph F Francois said that CITAC wanted a healthy domestic steel industry CITAC is not for putting the domestic steel industry out of business but they dont think import quotas are the answer she said Imports are not the problemother things are the problem The study said that technology was driving the longterm change in the industry while the steel ranks had been blaming other factors including imports Asked why modern efficient minimills like Nucor Corp and Steel Dynamics Inc also were citing imports as the cause of severe pricing declines Baughman had no hard answer I find that very sad she said These are companies that understand the value of imports to the US economy and have relied on imports themselves for raw materials I dont know Baughman emphasized that the Trade Partnership had no political agenda and defended the model as rigorous and not easily manipulated Its a model that takes into account the entire economy and the effects on everything from agriculture to banking in a change on steel imports using basic input and outputs she said

clarify this issue I am available today and tomorrow and will be travelling the remainder of this week Let me know what works for you and Mark Lisa Robert Bruce Sent by Robert Bruce AM To Lisa nron Mark CT cc Subject Re CFMA I am forwarding to you an email discussion I have had with Bill Nissen over an ambiguity in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of that troubles me somewhat The Act provides a new deregulated status for transactions in exempt commodities The definition of exempt commodities expressly excludes agricultural commodities Unfortunately agricultural commodities is not defined Usually when Congress or the CFTC makes a law or rule relating to special restrictions on the grains and meats they expressly reference the list of enumerated commodities found in Section a of the Commodity Exchange Act In the new bill the special restricted status just refers to agricultural commodities which raises the question do the special restrictions cover coffee sugar and cocoa as well Our two outside lawyers I have discussed this with so far Ken Raisler of Sullivan Cromwell in New York and Bill strongly believe the answer is no and that this ambiguity is the result of poor drafting of the bill rather than anything Congress intended to do I would agree that this is probably the case the strategy now is how do we get a degree of comfort that coffee sugar and cocoa are in fact exempt commodities Of course the highest degree of comfort would come in the form of Congressional amendment to the CFMA to clarify this issue obviously we cannot count on this happening on an expedited basis The next best thing would be a CFTC rule clarifying this As you know the CFTC withdrew the rules they had promulgated in December in light of the CFMA being signed into law and will presumably promulgate new rules supporting and implementing the CFMA But no one I have talked on the subject expects new CFTC rules anytime soon So the question is what should our stopgap strategy be to address this Bill has asked if we want him to research legislative history or approach the staff directly Im not sure if hes suggesting the ag committee staffs or the CFTC staff We might also consider a letter opinion on the issue from the CFTC These are not ideal solutions but they are the best I can think of especially given that the ag group would like to roll out softs products on EOL

as it is currently operated to be an electronic trading facility for purposes of the Act In other words all transactions in an exempt commodity on EnronOnline we believe are not entered into on a trading facility see Sec hB and therefore the notice requirements of Sec would not have to be complied with That is because the Acts definition of trading facility expressly excludes an electronic facility in which transactions are entered into bilaterally see Sec Bi on EnronOnline Enron is a party to every single transaction I agree that it seems odd that Congress would intend for coffee sugar and cocoa to fall within the special restrictions normally reserved for the enumerated grains and meats commodities It seems more likely that the ambiguity is the result of a drafting oversight rather than something Congress intended However it is troublesome to me that Congress was able to refer to the enumerated commodities in other portions of the Act and it is also troubling that coffee sugar and cocoa would be probably be considered agricultural commodities in the ordinary sense of the phrase The question remains then would we like you to research legislative intent or approach the

interested in pursuing your second question about the hedging study inasmuch as it relates only to full fledged contract markets I have reviewed the Act regarding your first question re the definition of agricultural commodity as it relates to the definition of exempt commodities Like you I cannot find a definition of agricultural commodity although the term is used elsewhere see sec g re excluded swaps Also see sec e part of sec which refers to current agricultural commodities as the enumerated commodities which are currently offered by exchanges Based on the language of the Act the most reasonable reading appears to be that agricultural commodities refers to the enumerated commodities The agricultural commodities are being singled out for special treatment and there is no indication that the Congress intended to extend special treatment to foreign agricultural commodities which have never been given special treatment in the past The primary significance of the exempt commodity category is in sec of the Act which allows certain offexchange derivatives to be offered on a largely unregulated basis For those transactions that will be traded with eligible commercial entities on an electronic trading facility under subsection there is a notice requirement Therefore if Enron wishes to conduct such business a good way to raise the issue with the CFTC would be to prepare such a notice and then provide it to the staff for prior review Acceptance of a notice listing commodities such as coffee sugar and cocoa would set a good precedent for treating these as nonagricultural commodities If Enron wishes only to offer contracts to eligible contract participants other than on a trading facility under subsection it will have to deal with the ambiguity directly Absent a CFTC regulation which may not come for some time the best way to deal with the issue as definitively as possible would be to raise it with the staff directly Otherwise we could do more research to see if

the CFTC rulemaking process Both Ken and Chris think that a legislative fix is not a realistic option I havent seen the RM yet but were keeping an eye out for it to be issued any day Let me know if you and Mark would like to discuss further Thanks Lisa Robert Bruce Sent by Robert Bruce AM To Lisa nron Mark CT cc Subject Re CFMA I am forwarding to you an email discussion I have had with Bill Nissen over an ambiguity in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of that troubles me somewhat The Act provides a new deregulated status for transactions in exempt commodities The definition of exempt commodities expressly excludes agricultural commodities Unfortunately agricultural commodities is not defined Usually when Congress or the CFTC makes a law or rule relating to special restrictions on the grains and meats they expressly reference the list of enumerated commodities found in Section a of the Commodity Exchange Act In the new bill the special restricted status just refers to agricultural commodities which raises the question do the special restrictions cover coffee sugar and cocoa as well Our two outside lawyers I have discussed this with so far Ken Raisler of Sullivan Cromwell in New York and Bill strongly believe the answer is no and that this ambiguity is the result of poor drafting of the bill rather than anything Congress intended to do I would agree that this is probably the case the strategy now is how do we get a degree of comfort that coffee sugar and cocoa are in fact exempt commodities Of course the highest degree of comfort would come in the form of Congressional amendment to the CFMA to clarify this issue obviously we cannot count on this happening on an expedited basis The next best thing would be a CFTC rule clarifying this As you know the CFTC withdrew the rules they had promulgated in December in light of the CFMA being signed into law and will presumably promulgate new rules supporting and implementing the CFMA But no one I have talked on the subject expects new CFTC rules anytime soon So the question is what should our stopgap strategy be to address this Bill has asked if we want him to research legislative history or approach the staff directly Im not sure if hes suggesting the ag committee staffs or the CFTC staff We might also consider a letter opinion on the issue from the CFTC These are not ideal solutions but they are the best I can think of especially given that the ag group would like to roll out softs products on EOL in the next couple of months or so I propose the three of us meet to discuss strategy on the issue Bob Robert E Bruce Senior Counsel Enron North America Corp T F Forwarded by Robert BruceNAEnron on AM Robert Bruce Sent by Robert Bruce AM To Nissen William J idleycom cc Subject Re CFMA Thank you Bill I think your analysis is wellreasoned I would like to point out that we do not consider EnronOnline as it is currently operated to be an electronic trading facility for purposes of the Act In other words all transactions in an exempt commodity on EnronOnline we believe are not entered into on a trading facility see Sec hB and therefore the notice requirements of Sec would not have to be complied with That is because the Acts definition of trading facility expressly excludes an electronic facility in which transactions are entered into bilaterally see Sec Bi on EnronOnline Enron is a party to every single transaction I agree that it seems odd that Congress would intend for coffee sugar and cocoa to fall within the special restrictions normally reserved for the enumerated

cannot find a definition of agricultural commodity although the term is used elsewhere see sec g re excluded swaps Also see sec e part of sec which refers to current agricultural commodities as the enumerated commodities which are currently offered by exchanges Based on the language of the Act the most reasonable reading appears to be that agricultural commodities refers to the enumerated commodities The agricultural commodities are being singled out for special treatment and there is no indication that the Congress intended to extend special treatment to foreign agricultural commodities which have never been given special treatment in the past The primary significance of the exempt commodity category is in sec of the Act which allows certain offexchange derivatives to be

Therefore if Enron wishes to conduct such business a good way to raise the issue with the CFTC would be to prepare such a notice and then provide it to the staff for prior review Acceptance of a notice listing commodities such as coffee sugar and cocoa would set a good precedent for treating these as nonagricultural commodities If Enron wishes only to offer contracts to eligible contract participants other than on a trading facility under subsection it will have to deal with the ambiguity directly Absent a CFTC regulation which may not come for some time the best way to deal with the

clarify this issue I am available today and tomorrow and will be travelling the remainder of this week Let me know what works for you and Mark Lisa Robert Bruce Sent by Robert Bruce AM To Lisa nron Mark CT cc Subject Re CFMA I am forwarding to you an email discussion I have had with Bill Nissen over an ambiguity in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of that troubles me somewhat The Act provides a new deregulated status for transactions in exempt commodities The definition of exempt commodities expressly excludes agricultural commodities Unfortunately agricultural commodities is not defined Usually when Congress or the CFTC makes a law or rule relating to special restrictions on the grains and meats they expressly reference the list of enumerated commodities found in Section a of the Commodity Exchange Act In the new bill the special restricted status just refers to agricultural commodities which raises the question do the special restrictions cover coffee sugar and cocoa as well Our two outside lawyers I have discussed this with so far Ken Raisler of Sullivan Cromwell in New York and Bill strongly believe the answer is no and that this ambiguity is the result of poor drafting of the bill rather than anything Congress intended to do I would agree that this is probably the case the strategy now is how do we get a degree of comfort that coffee sugar and cocoa are in fact exempt commodities Of course the highest degree of comfort would come in the form of Congressional amendment to the CFMA to clarify this issue obviously we cannot count on this happening on an expedited basis The next best thing would be a CFTC rule clarifying this As you know the CFTC withdrew the rules they had promulgated in December in light of the CFMA being signed into law and will presumably promulgate new rules supporting and implementing the CFMA But no one I have talked on the subject expects new CFTC rules anytime soon So the question is what should our stopgap strategy be to address this Bill has asked if we want him to research legislative history or approach the staff directly Im not sure if hes suggesting the ag committee staffs or the CFTC staff We might also consider a letter opinion on the issue from the CFTC These are not ideal solutions but they are the best I can think of especially given that the ag group would like to roll out softs products on EOL in the next couple of months or so I propose the three of us meet to discuss strategy on the issue Bob Robert E Bruce Senior Counsel Enron North America Corp T F Forwarded by Robert BruceNAEnron on AM Robert Bruce Sent by Robert Bruce AM To Nissen William J idleycom cc Subject Re CFMA Thank you Bill I think your analysis is wellreasoned I would like to point out that we do not consider EnronOnline as it is currently operated to be an electronic trading facility for purposes of the Act In other words all transactions in an exempt commodity on EnronOnline we believe are not entered into on a trading facility see Sec hB and therefore the notice requirements of Sec would not have to be complied with That is because the Acts definition of trading facility expressly excludes an electronic facility in which transactions are entered into bilaterally see Sec Bi on EnronOnline Enron is a party to every single transaction I agree that it seems odd that Congress would intend for coffee sugar and cocoa to fall within the special restrictions normally reserved for the enumerated grains and meats commodities It seems more likely that the ambiguity is the result of a drafting oversight rather than something Congress intended However it is troublesome to me that Congress was able to refer to the enumerated commodities in other portions of the Act and it is also troubling that coffee sugar

NET ADVANTAGE Pittsburgh Post Gazette Editorial Washington should regulate access to the Web Monday November Pittsburgh PostGazette How will most of us access the Internet in years Via wireless technology Satellites Cable wire DSL phone lines Like most smart people humbled by the rate of technological change Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard does not know the answer to that question As a result the commission is wary of treating the cable industry however promising its prospects as the sole provider of highspeed broadband Internet access and thus deserving of a whole new regulatory regime Mr Kennard knows how stifling that can be on a nascent technology Better for the federal government to allow competing channels to the Internet to develop unimpaired and intervene only when absolutely necessary to ensure competition Unfortunately local regulators across the country have been undermining this federal regulatory restraint by imposing Internetrelated burdens on cable companies at the municipal level egged on by a powerful lobbying alliance of regional phone companies and Internet service providers Ongoing negotiations to renew the citys cable franchise agreement have made Pittsburgh the latest ground zero in this ferocious and important battle to determine the future of the nations telecommunications policy Pittsburgh City Council should resist the lure of notoriety take a pass and recognize that major shifts in national policy should be left to the Congress and to the Federal Communications Commission Council members should desist from forcing ATT to require open access to other Internet service providers as a condition to a new cable franchise agreement Beyond the fact that such a move would be of dubious legality it would also set Pittsburgh at a competitive disadvantage in terms of broadband access to the Internet as ATT would likely delay expanding service during a protracted legal struggle Franchise agreements between municipalities and cable companies used to be fairly cut and dried Within the parameters established by the Federal Communications Commission each side would haggle over rightsofway fees in Pittsburghs case some million a year and then call it a day But no more Last December as a condition for approving the transfer of the local cable franchise Portland Oregon required ATT to open its cable lines to rival Internet serviceproviders instead of necessarily bundling its own affiliate Home with the service They did so under the banner of open access and each subsequent franchise negotiation has been a major battle A federal appeals court is now determining whether Portland had the power to do so ATT is betting heavily on cable as the Internets future having spent more than billion on cable companies and billions more to update their systems It was through its billion acquisition of TCI Inc early this year that ATT picked up the cable franchise in Pittsburgh as well as its controlling stake in and exclusive contract with Home Relatively few Americans now access the Internet via cable but more and more will be making the switch as ATT and other cable players complete the necessary investment Cable access is dozens of times quicker than your traditional phone dialup service Though America Online now has times more members than Home it and other established Internet providers fear the potential of an ATT monopoly as people flock over to cable America Online does not want its members to have to choose between it and greater speed it wants to keep its members whether they opt to dial in via Bell Atlantics phone line satellite or ATTs cable line The open access proponents argue that it undercuts consumer choice and desirable competition to have Home as the sole cablebased portal to the Web They point to the longdistance telephone market as a regulatory model in which one company controls the wire into consumers homes but consumers are still able to choose service providers which in turn pay the wire owner for their traffic This is a compelling vision and may in time become the desirable model for federal policy But the PostGazette believes that it is premature to rush to such a judgment ATT may yet conclude that it is best served by opening up its wires to all players as a means of hastening Internet consumers migration to cable There have been reports of talks between ATT and AOL about such a possibility and ATT management has made no secret of its mixed feelings about being tied to Home Second it may be too early to discount faster DSL phone lines satellite and wireless technologies as viable alternatives to access the Net But even if one ascribes to the view that a forced open access is needed now the fight should be taken up in Congress and at the FCC It is absurd to believe that policy crucial to the Information Ages nervous system can be cobbled together municipalitybymunicipality Pittsburgh should join such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles that have declined to throw up roadblocks to the timely rollout of what potentially will be one of many faster roads online

<1959061.1075843083596.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lisa.yoho@enron.com,1999-11-09 05:56:00,Re Bandwidth Trading Article Cc Thought you might be interested in this article I picked up on forced access Lisa NET ADVANTAGE Pittsburgh Post Gazette Editorial Washington should regulate access to the Web Monday November Pittsburgh PostGazette How will most of us access the Internet in years Via wireless technology Satellites Cable wire DSL phone lines Like most smart people humbled by the rate of technological change Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard does not know the answer to that question As a result the commission is wary of treating the cable industry however promising its prospects as the sole provider of highspeed broadband Internet access and thus deserving of a whole new regulatory regime Mr Kennard knows how stifling that can be on a nascent technology Better for the federal government to allow competing channels to the Internet to develop unimpaired and intervene only when absolutely necessary to ensure competition Unfortunately local regulators across the country have been undermining this federal regulatory restraint by imposing Internetrelated burdens on cable companies at the municipal level egged on by a powerful lobbying alliance of regional phone companies and Internet service providers Ongoing negotiations to renew the citys cable franchise agreement have made Pittsburgh the latest ground zero in this ferocious and important battle to determine the future of the nations telecommunications policy Pittsburgh City Council should resist the lure of notoriety take a pass and recognize that major shifts in national policy should be left to the Congress and to the Federal Communications Commission Council members should desist from forcing ATT to require open access to other Internet service providers as a condition to a new cable franchise agreement Beyond the fact that such a move would be of dubious legality it would also set Pittsburgh at a competitive disadvantage in terms of broadband access to the Internet as ATT would likely delay expanding service during a protracted legal struggle Franchise agreements between municipalities and cable companies used to be fairly cut and dried Within the parameters established by the Federal Communications Commission each side would haggle over rightsofway fees in Pittsburghs case some million a year and then call it a day But no more Last December as a condition for approving the transfer of the local cable franchise Portland Oregon required ATT to open its cable lines to rival Internet serviceproviders instead of necessarily bundling its own affiliate Home with the service They did so under the banner of open access and each subsequent franchise negotiation has been a major battle A federal appeals court is now determining whether Portland had the power to do so ATT is betting heavily on cable as the Internets future having spent more than billion on cable companies and billions more to update their systems It was through its billion acquisition of TCI Inc early this year that ATT picked up the cable franchise in Pittsburgh as well as its controlling stake in and exclusive contract with Home Relatively few Americans now access the Internet via cable but more and more will be making the switch as ATT and other cable players complete the necessary investment Cable access is dozens of times quicker than your traditional phone dialup service Though America Online now has times more members than Home it and other established Internet providers fear the potential of an ATT monopoly as people flock over to cable America Online does not want its members to have to choose between it and greater speed it wants to keep its members whether they opt to dial in via Bell Atlantics phone line satellite or ATTs cable line The open access proponents argue that it undercuts consumer choice and desirable competition to have Home as the sole cablebased portal to the Web They point to the longdistance telephone market as a regulatory model in which one company controls the wire into consumers homes but consumers are still able to choose service providers which in turn pay the wire owner for their traffic This is a compelling vision and may in time become the desirable model for federal policy But the PostGazette believes that it is premature to rush to such a judgment ATT may yet conclude that it is best served by opening up its wires to all players as a means of hastening Internet consumers migration to cable There have been reports of talks between ATT and AOL about such a possibility and ATT management has made no secret of its mixed feelings about being tied to Home Second it may be too early to discount faster DSL phone lines satellite and wireless technologies as viable alternatives to access the Net But even if one ascribes to the view that a forced open access is needed now the fight should be taken up in Congress and at the FCC It is absurd to believe that policy crucial to the Information Ages nervous system can be cobbled together municipalitybymunicipality Pittsburgh should join such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles that have declined to throw up roadblocks to the timely rollout of what potentially will be one of many faster roads online
