RESTRUCTURINGTRANSMISSION TASK FORCE AND IEP POLICY COMMITTEE FROMSTEVEN KELLY IEP POLICY DIRECTOR DATE OCTOBER RE IEP RestructuringTransmission Special Fund SolicitationNovember During the past summer IEP circulated to the IEP RestructuringTransmissi on Task Force a number of Special Fund Solicitations Overall the response to these solicitations were lukewarm at best Given this response IEP inferred that the task force membrship while perhaps interested in the issues was not interested infundingadditional IEP involvement in restructuringtransmisison related matters Given thisrecent historyIEP circulated via email about days ago to t he IEP Policy Committee ie the Board and the RestructuringTransmission Task Forcea Notice regardinga proposal for IEP to move forward in responding to recent filings at FERC related to price caps and wholesale market structures in California In that email notice however IEP also indicated plans torespond to recentfilings at FERCthrough the IEP Marke t Response Project The rationale for using the IEP Market Response Project was twofold first the planned response and recommendations that would b e contained in the FERC filings essentially would build on the work alread y accomplished through the Market Response Project and second the RestructuringTransmission Task Force funding was essentially depleted to conduct this type of work While agreening that the work contemplated needed to be accomplished the Market Response Committee comprised primarily of Public Relations representatives from the individual companies believe that the better vehicle for an IEP response is through the IEP Restructuring and Transmission Task Force comprised primarily of regulatory affairs representatives from the individual companies Accordingly IEP is once again planning on using the IEP RestructuringTransmission Task force as th e vehicle to respond to allegations of generator market power abuse and marke t structure dysfunction Howeever to accomplish this activity IEP must conduct a significant solicitation of the task force members to raise funds to engage IEP at the FERC and the CPUC as necessary to provide a unified industry response to the many allegations filed against the industry and t he California market structure As a reminder as was made clear during the most recent CAISO vote lowering price caps to approximately MWH increasing to MWH depending on load conditions many important market participants are seeking to totally reregulate the generation and transmission business in California Note the CMUAmuni filing at FERC to create and implement a costbased TRANSCO the IOU proposal to the EOBCPU C to build the next generation of generation at costbased rates ATTACHED IS A MEMO DESCRIBING THE ISSUES AT THE FERC AND PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF AN IEP RESPONSE TO RECENT FERC FILINGS RELATED TO MARKET POWER ABUSE AND A DYSFUNCTION MARKET STRUCTURE To accomplish these filings IEP must raise funds to pay for consultants To date IEP already has filed in four proceedings These include the following o FERC IEP Motion To Intervene on CAISO Amendment No price caps and forward markets o CPUC IEP Comments on Assigned Commissioner Ruling Wood Investigating Wholesale Electric Markets o CPUCIEP Motion To Intervene on SCEPGESDGE Motion To EndRate Freeze o CPUC IEP Comments on Proposed and Alternate Decisions of Commissioners Wood and Duque respectfully in the Investigation on Wholesale Markets OII Accordingly IEP is issuing this IEP RestructuringTransmission Special Fu nd Solicitation to fund our FERC and CPUC interventions on market structure matters We believe it is critical that we respond collectively as a California based industry As indicated in the attached memo we also believe that the this response will be directly linked now and in the futu re to the work being accomplished through the Market Response Project particularly as regards message themes and recommendations The primary difference will be the audience whereas the Market Response Project is primarily targeted at legislators editorial board members and key policymakers the IEP RestructuringTransmisison Task Force effort will be targeted primarily at regulators such as the FERC the CPUC and the EOB To accomplish a successful outcome in this endeavor we are seekingat lea st from large companies and from smaller companies This wil l help defray some of the cost already borne by IEP to date on regulatory related matters and position us to continue this activity through the forseeable future IF YOUR COMPANY IS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS EFFORT PLEASE SO INDICATE BY RESPONDING TO THIS EMAIL AND INDICATING THE LEVEL OF YOUR SPECIAL FUND COMMITMENT AS NOTED WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO RAISE AT LEAST FROM LARGE COMPANIES AND AT LEAST FROM SMALLER COMPANIES HOWEVER EVERYTHING WILL HELP If you have any questions or comments please contact IEP We need a response as soon as possible IEP FERC Response

RESTRUCTURINGTRANSMISSION TASK FORCE AND IEP POLICY COMMITTEE FROMSTEVEN KELLY IEP POLICY DIRECTOR DATE OCTOBER RE IEP RestructuringTransmission Special Fund SolicitationNovember During the past summer IEP circulated to the IEP RestructuringTransmissi on Task Force a number of Special Fund Solicitations Overall the response to these solicitations were lukewarm at best Given this response IEP

to recent filings at FERC related to price caps and wholesale market structures in California In that email notice however IEP also indicated plans torespond to recentfilings at FERCthrough the IEP Marke t Response Project The rationale for using the IEP Market Response Project was twofold first the planned response and recommendations that would b e contained in the FERC filings essentially would build on the work alread y accomplished through the Market Response Project and second the RestructuringTransmission Task Force funding was essentially depleted to conduct this type of work While agreening that the work contemplated needed to be accomplished the Market Response Committee comprised primarily of Public Relations representatives from the individual companies believe that the better vehicle for an IEP response is through the IEP Restructuring and Transmission Task Force comprised primarily of regulatory affairs representatives from the individual companies Accordingly IEP is once again planning on using the IEP RestructuringTransmission Task force as th e vehicle to respond to allegations of generator market power abuse and marke t structure dysfunction Howeever to accomplish this activity IEP must conduct a significant solicitation of the task force members to raise funds to engage IEP at the FERC and the CPUC as necessary to provide a unified industry response to the many allegations filed against the industry and t he California market structure As a reminder as was made clear during the most recent CAISO vote lowering price caps to approximately MWH increasing to MWH depending on load conditions many important market participants are seeking to totally reregulate the generation and transmission business in California Note the CMUAmuni filing at FERC to create and implement a costbased TRANSCO the IOU proposal to the EOBCPU C to build the next generation of generation at costbased rates ATTACHED IS A MEMO DESCRIBING THE ISSUES AT THE FERC AND PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF AN IEP RESPONSE TO RECENT FERC FILINGS RELATED TO MARKET POWER ABUSE AND A DYSFUNCTION MARKET STRUCTURE To accomplish these filings IEP must raise funds to pay for consultants To date IEP already has filed in four proceedings These include the following o FERC IEP Motion To Intervene on CAISO Amendment No price caps and forward markets o CPUC IEP Comments on Assigned Commissioner Ruling Wood Investigating Wholesale Electric Markets o CPUCIEP Motion To Intervene on SCEPGESDGE Motion To EndRate Freeze o CPUC IEP Comments on Proposed and Alternate Decisions of Commissioners Wood and Duque respectfully in the Investigation on Wholesale Markets OII Accordingly IEP is issuing this IEP RestructuringTransmission Special Fu nd Solicitation to fund our FERC and CPUC interventions on market structure matters We believe it is critical that we respond collectively as a California based industry As indicated in the attached memo we also believe that the this response will be directly linked now and in the futu re to the work being accomplished through the Market Response Project particularly as regards message themes and recommendations The primary difference will be the audience whereas the Market Response Project is primarily targeted at legislators editorial board members and key policymakers the IEP RestructuringTransmisison Task Force effort will be targeted primarily at regulators such as the FERC the CPUC and the EOB To accomplish a successful outcome in this endeavor we are seekingat lea st from large companies and from smaller companies This wil l help defray some of the cost already borne by IEP to date on regulatory related matters and position us to continue this activity through the forseeable future IF YOUR COMPANY IS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS EFFORT PLEASE SO INDICATE BY RESPONDING TO THIS EMAIL AND INDICATING THE LEVEL OF YOUR SPECIAL FUND COMMITMENT AS NOTED WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO RAISE AT LEAST FROM
