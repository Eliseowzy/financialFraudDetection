it even if the ascription involves intuiting the meaning of marksbarely discernible to the human eye the words of Judge Charles Burton who presided over Palm Beach Countys recount Beneath such

has been illegal for felons to cast ballots in Florida David Kidwell Phil long and Geoff Dougherty Excerpts At least Florida felons voted illegally on Nov The tainted votes found in a review of nearly half a million votes cast in Florida counties provide evidence that the presidential race was influenced by thousands of ineligible voters Nearly six million voters in Floridas counties cast ballots Nearly percent of the illegal ballots discovered by The Herald were cast by registered Democrats The votes could be seized upon by the Bush campaign to argue that a large number of illegal votes were probably cast for his opponent outweighing the effect of any recount Its a very powerful argument said Robert Jarvis a law professor at Nova Southeastern University The Herald found robbers drug dealers killers rapists and seven kidnappers who cast ballots At least two who voted are pictured on the states online registry of sexual offenders Clarence Eden Williams of Pahokee also voted His picture is posted on the state registry of sexual offenders for his crimes against children His son was surprised his father cast a ballot Hes got Alzheimers and he cant even carry on a conversation anymore said Clarence Williams III The Herald review included percent of the million votes cast on Nov It encompassed all votes cast in Palm Beach and Pasco counties most votes cast in Duval County and only absentee votes in MiamiDade Broward Lee Leon Hillsborough Clay and the Panhandle counties of Escambia Okaloosa and Bay To find felony voters The Herald compared a list of voters in those counties with a Department of Corrections database listing felons who had served at least a year in prison If the pattern found in the study is the same statewide more than felons likely cast illegal ballots Full Article contentarchivenewselectdigdocshtm RealClearPoliticscom THERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY John McIntyre For the past three weeks all we have heard from Democrats and the media about the struggle in Florida is that both sides are at fault neither candidate has been presidential and a pox on both your houses This case for moral equivalency between Bush and Gore is critical to the Democrats argument If as the rationale goes both sides are to blame and the election ended in a tie then why cant we just have a compromise that affords both sides with a chance win the Presidency This would seem like a reasonable solution provided those underlying suppositions were true The problem for Gore is that the suppositions are not even close to being true Both sides are not to blame And this election while ridiculously close did not end a tie Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of the votes He has had that recount of votes When the recount upheld the original result that should have been the end of this fiasco However even before the original recount was finished Gore and his partner in crime Senator Lieberman decided in their minds that they really won

the Bush Cheney Recount here ContributionContributioncfmAIDIVFFBXFAZHGH AOL contribution link at bottom Bush News Contents Talking Points to Set the Record Straight Statement by Secretary James A Baker III What Theyre Saying TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT MYTH There are more than votes in MiamiDade that have never been counted BOIES There are over ballots that have never been counted once for the presidency of the United States Today Show FACT Every ballot in MiamiDade was counted at least twice once on election night and again during the automatic recount In every election there are a significant number of ballots that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot including races for President For example in this election of the voters in Idaho of the voters in Illinois and of the voters in Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President The votes actually according to their filing about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only of the ballots cast in MiamiDade These ballots were counted twice they merely registered no vote for President This reality reflects common sense a voter may want to vote for a candidate for the Senate House or other office but be undecided about the choice for President In particular a voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates but be uncomfortable with his or her partys choice for President and yet unwilling to vote for the other partys candidate So he or she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for President MYTH If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the recount Gore would actually be ahead by votes FACT Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount from MiamiDade and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of the certified votes from Nassau County The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of pm on Sunday for completing manual recounts almost tripling the statutory time period for counting mandated by Floridas Legislature Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Courts deadline MiamiDade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with a manual recount The interim gain for Gore in MiamiDade came from a selective recount of the most Democrat precincts Gore won these selected precincts by approximately to while Gore won the entire county only by to It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican precincts too Precincts in MiamiDade including those with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters favored Bush The Gore approach would treat these minorities in a discriminatory fashion Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law should be counted Counties recognized this and counted them Even Joe Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected MYTH MiamiDade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican mob that intimidated the canvassing board KLAIN We think already almost votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the count But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility stop a count and then thats going to provide the end because a partisan of the Bush campaign Ms Harris refuses to accept returns and cuts off the counting I dont think thats the kind of end that we have to American elections Good Morning America ABC FACT The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Boards decision to move the recount behind closed doors where it could not be observed by the public or the media and to limit the recount to only a select set of the votes No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd The police made no arrests received no assault complaints and did not even instruct the crowd to desist The crowd was quieted promptly MYTH In Nassau County the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal FACT On election night all the votes were counted but during the machine recount ballots were accidentally separated from the rest and not counted As a result Bush received fewer votes and Gore received fewer votes than on election night After the recount the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her mistake and tried to correct it Because the Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final certification until Sunday at pm the Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count to make it accurate The Board Democrats and Republican voted unanimously to certify the original election night count which included the ballots rather than the machine recount total which mistakenly omitted those ballots STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A BAKER III Ladies and Gentlemen Regrettably the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit contesting the certified election results in Florida Their aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after days of counts and recounts As I said last night America has never had a presidential election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new uncertain and controversial territory Therefore I would now like to introduce the senior members of the litigation team who will be defending the vote of Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee Florida with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig Mr Richard a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of Florida has years of trial experience Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago Illinois Together they bring to this team years of practice as trial attorneys The other two members of our senior litigation team are law partners of mine at Baker Botts in Houston Texas Together Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have years of experience practicing in court These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize WHAT THEYRE SAYING Quotes from Democrats Its not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last legal limit to get the electionI dont think he should US Senator Russ Feingold DWisconsin Lacrosse Tribune US Rep Gene Taylor DBay St Louis Mississippi will vote for Texas Gov George W Bush if the presidential race is ultimately decided by the US House of Representatives I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth Congressional District voted And in this case Governor Bush carried my district The Mississippi Sun Herald Monday Indiana House Speaker John Gregg DSandborn called on Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election in doubt for days He needs to pick up the phone call Austin and say Mr President congratulations I support you as president percent Indianapolis Star Selfdescribed liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBCs Hardball with Chris Matthews Theyre talking about people that they said their votes didnt count There are other people in Florida whos votes were not counted that lie in George Bush countryMany many more are Bush votes and they dont say a word about that Quotes from Media Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channels Hannity and Colmes a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of thought and logic and argument You cannot say of the ballot just because nobody voted for Bush or Gore that its really a secret Gore vote that didnt get counted Saloncoms Joan Walsh His condescending singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was almost insulting Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBCs Imus in the Morning Imus What if Gore had won and BushI mean what if the roles were reversed how would I wouldnt want to include you in this but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be treating all this if the roles were reversed Fineman Oh my God you kidding That George Bush was a cry baby that he was the spoiled son of a failed President You know you can just here it The personal attacks on Bush would be just absolutely vicious Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC Connolly But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore that you sometimes get that has turned off many Americans over time And you also got a little bit of whining frankly when he started talking about voter intimidation Reid Some thought it very odd why they had all the photographers in there flashing It was a bit distracting And the flags some people think maybe its an overdose on the flags And another question a very formal setting for a very personal conversation with the American people Howard Fineman on MSNBC Fineman He Gore had to make clear to people that there was something about him some essential goodness in him that made it worth fighting this fight And when he said If I lose so be it he had to be convincing on that point And I must say after all the arguing in this very divided election its going to be hard for most Americans to agree with that most Americans think that this election was fair Hes got to make the case that it isnt and its hard for him to do it political terms Im not sure how much time he really has AOL contribution link a hrefContributionContributioncfmAIDIVFFBXFAZH GHContributea Paid for by Bush Cheney Recount To

Bush Statement by James Baker III re FL Supreme Court Decision Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again Washington Post Send in the Thugs Gores Point Man Argued Against Dimples in Statement by Governor George W Bush November I am disappointed with last nights ruling by the Florida Supreme Court We believe the justices have used the bench to change Floridas election laws and usurp the authority of Floridas election officials We believe the court overreached Writing laws is the duty of the legislature administering laws is the duty of the executive branch Two weeks after the presidential election a court has decided that Floridas deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a deadline at all The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes that have already been counted at least two times and in some cases three or four times will continue more than a week after the law says it should And the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language But make no mistake the court rewrote the law It changed the rules and it did so after the election was over Full Statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by James Baker III Senior Advisor BushCheney Recount At Mondays oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court Justice Harding asked a key question about Floridas electoral laws and standards Is it right to change the rules in the middle of the game The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral boards have now decided to do just that Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count Dimpled Ballots So For the past week the Gore campaign has been saying that the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of this election But now that they didnt get a decision exactly to their liking the Gore campaign is backpedaling and saying that they will leave all their options open In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be counted as votes the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke case in Illinois but the Illinois case didnt talk about dimpled chads at all It involved hanging chads the standard that these three counties began using and the standard that they are now seeking to change There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas governing manual recounts In Texas this would all be over because Texas only allows one manual recount and it has very clear and objective standards The first of those is when you see light coming through and the second of those is where you have a hanging chad Its only in the third instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any consideration of a dimpled chad and it doesnt say that a dimpled chad can be considered standing alone It says it can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote With its decision the Florida Supreme Court has decided to change the rules in the middle of the game The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both the executive and legislative branches They effectively rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly belonged to the Florida Secretary of State This decision by seven Democrat justices completely politicizes the votecounting process by putting the fate of this election in the hands of the six Democrats two independents and only one Republican that control the Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual recounts In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this election the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the rules in three counties that are still conducting manual recounts Statistical experts have said that under the current standards Gore will not get enough votes to overcome Governor Bushs lead So now the Gore campaign is looking to change those standards in the middle of the process The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a slight indentation No hole in the ballot is necessary No single loose corner is necessary Not even seeing any light through the ballot is necessary This lenient standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent enough votes to overturn the election Ten years ago the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots should be counted that stated But a chad that is fully attached bearing only an indentation should not be counted as a vote Now Democrats want to unfairly change those rules The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes they need is to keep changing the rules This is unfair and unacceptable This election must be decided by the rules that existed on Election Day not the rules rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged environment two weeks later The Washington Post SEND IN THE THUGS Michael Kelly Excerpt Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida he will have come very very close to winning Moreover he will have done this with his imageskin more or less intact For Gore has already won an astonishing propaganda victory With the help of reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and liberal national press corps he has managed to spin his extraordinary radical unprecedented behavior as reasonable and legitimate This probably ensures that future close presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies of lawyers and thugs demanding recounts rewriting

from one table to the next after the ballots were already being counted etc Conflicting statements A Broward County attorney said a manual count requires machine error yet the board reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count despite no machine problems Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no evidence of equipment problems and that he was surprised by the very small number of changes discovered for Gore Falling chad on the floor on the counting tables on chairs etc There is no reasonable assurance to voters that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure the integrity and security of the ballots The canvassing board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the counting until they do so Election officials

the end of the day Elector is a position of public trust so some level of scrutiny is fair What is not fair and is in fact sinister are revelations that Bob Beckel Democrat solon occasional host of Crossfire and campaign manager for Walter Mondales failed presidential bid may be engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since Watergate It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly appropriate Since the morning after the election there have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral College If Bush wins Florida he becomes president by one more electoral vote than the required If three Republican electors switch to Gore the Tennessean gains a majority and wins the White House According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere Beckel who has close ties to Gore recount team leader Warren Christopher is engaged in an opposition research project targeting Republican electors Calling his efforts information gathering he says he is working independently of the Gore campaign Bill Daley the vice presidents campaign chairman has publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors I think there is a presumption that those members who are voting vote based upon the election he has said I believe the vast majority of them are legally bound And I would assume if youre legally bound you believe youre morally bound Anyone in politics knows opposition research is a polite synonym for digging up dirt The threat explicit in Beckels project is that the lives of electors are going to be examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to call on mostly Democrats but some Republicans too and ask Who are these electors and what do you know about them That is what blackmailers do too Democrats need to call today for Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does The presidential election

Impasse in Florida A Summary Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker Las Vegas Sun Statistics point to more than random error in Florida vote Philadelphia Inquirer Gore might lose a second round Media suppressed the Bush vote Chicago Sun Times How Democrats Steal Elections Court Upholds Florida Vote Deadline The Associated Press Tuesday Nov pm EST TALLAHASSEE Fla A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that state officials may cut off the vote recount in the states fiercely contested presidential election at pm EST Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or corrected totals after the deadline and Secretary of State Katherine Harris may consider them if she employs proper exercise of discretion A Proposal to End the Impasse in Florida A Summary Tuesday November Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney want to bring some finality to the election process in Florida They believe the American people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks The vote in Florida has been counted It has been recounted Both times Governor Bush has emerged the winner And there have been no allegations of vote fraud in either the count or the recount Confusion yes Fraud no Yet the Gore campaign refuses to accept the result Rather than accept the result the Gore campaign has demanded manual recounts in predominantly Democratic counties In fact the Gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly Democratic precincts in these counties to recount Broward County Precinct F votes for Gore for Bush Precinct F votes for Gore for Bush Precinct C votes for Gore for Bush This might lead to the conclusion that the Gore campaign is more focused on selectivity than fairness Even still Gore was only able to pick up four votes through the manual recounts of the three Gorechosen counties in Democratic Broward County Based on this small change in votes the Broward County canvassing board voted to not expand the manual recount to the entire county Yet now the Gore campaign wants to force Broward County officials to continue the manual count This is after they have talked for days about letting the local officials run the recounts And yesterday the Florida Secretary of State reiterated that Florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to certify its election returns by pm today Amazingly the Gore campaign has filed a lawsuit to block the application of the statute It seems the Gore campaign places great weight on Florida law only when they think it serves their tactics In sum the Gore campaign has been unwilling to accept any finality They refused to accept the first vote They refused to accept the recount They refused to accept the manual recounts in selective counties Thats why today Secretary James A Baker offered the following common sense proposal to solve the impasse Governor Bush has objected to the manual recount Vice President Gore has objected to todays pm deadline required by Florida law Governor Bush is therefore proposing to accept the manual recount up to todays pm deadline if Vice President Gore agrees This is fair proposal that will bring this divisive process to a reasonable conclusion Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker In earlier statements we have emphasized the importance of achieving some finality to the election process not just here in Florida but of course for the nation as a whole More and more we see uncertainty in financial markets and we see uncertainty abroad I believe that most observers whether at home or abroad are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until a candidate achieves the result he seeks The vote in Florida was counted and then it was recounted

one in million the chances of hitting Megabucks on one spin are slim but not as slim as the odds that Vice President Al Gore would make up as much ground as he has in the Florida recount according to a UNLV study Economics professor Tom Carroll began running statistical equations Thursday on the net gains both Gore who gained more than votes and Texas Gov George W Bush who added about votes have made in the recount He found that the statistical chances for such large and different totals to occur as a result of random glitches was less than infinitesimal The probability of being struck by

sunbinstoriesarchivesnovhtml Philadelphia Inquirer Gore might lose a second round Media suppressed the Bush vote John R Lott Jr With Floridas election results so close charges of voter confusion and intimidation fill the air Votes have been recounted and are being recounted yet again Because of the closeness of the race problems that have been ignored in the past are difficult to ignore now So what has created this incredible closeness The Gore campaign along with the media has focused on possible problems in Palm Beach county Supposedly had it not been for the spoiled ballots where voters cast more than two votes for president and the votes that Buchanan received there would have been a Gore victory But by now many have heard that the spoiled ballots are nothing new in Palm Beach where ballots suffered similar problems in the last presidential election Heavily Republican Duval County apparently had over similarly spoiled ballots Buchanans votes are actually not an anomaly With registered members of the American Reform Reform and Independent Parties Palm Beach is a hotbed of Reform party activity Indeed it has the second highest total Reform and Independent party membership of any county in the state Hillsborough County which comes in third lags behind with members Up to twothirds of Buchanans vote in Palm Beach can be explained simply by county differences in party registration A more important explanation for the close results exists By prematurely declaring Gore the winner shortly before polls had closed in Floridas conservative western Panhandle the media ended up suppressing the Republican vote Bush obtained over percent of the vote in the affected area With only votes separating the two candidates Friday morning even a few hundred discouraged votes

Filling in Blanks on Ballots Buchanan Numbers Possible Democrats Urge Gore to Quit Legal Wrangling New York Times Washington Post Others Revote or Court Remedy Politically Unsound and Legally Questionable STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A BAKER III The American people voted on November Governor George W Bush won states with a total of electoral votes The vote in Florida was very close but when it was counted Governor Bush was the winner Now three days later the vote in Florida has been recounted Over twothirds of the state election supervisors overseeing the recount are Democrats At the end of this recount Governor Bush is still the winner subject only to counting the overseas ballots which have traditionally favored the Republican candidate No evidence of vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has been presented Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the recount It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly prolong the countrys national Presidential election through endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida Furthermore the more often ballots are recounted especially by hand the more likely it is that human errors like lost ballots and other risks will be introduced This frustrates the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to machine counting Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot There is a rule of law to be followed for elections The state of Florida has established legal procedures to design approve publish and if need be to protest ballots before the election The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor She approved it The Democratic Party did not question it before the election This butterflytype ballot was used in recent elections in the same county under the same rules Again the Democrats did not complain The overwhelming majority of voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot and we have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you to see The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that double marked ballots are not counted A key principle in America is one person one vote If we have ballots with two votes of course we cannot count them or guess about them Ballots that are doublemarked cant be evidence of the voters intent to vote one way or another No jurisdiction in the United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote and Florida law specifically does not It happens in every precinct in every election And the procedure is clear These ballots must be disregarded We understand and I understand personally that it is frustrating to lose by a narrow margin But it happens It happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in and Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the countrys interest first They accepted the vote for the good of the country It is important that there be some finality to the election process What if we insisted on recounts in other states that are very close For example in Wisconsin Iowa and if we dont win New Mexico Let the country step back a moment pause and think about whats at stake This may be the last chance There is no reasonable end to this process if it slips away The purpose of our national election is to establish a Constitutional government not unending legal wrangling We will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaigns efforts to keep recounting until it likes the result For the good of the country and the sake of our standing in the world the campaigning should end and the business of an orderly transition should begin STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won Floridas election and a recount has now confirmed his victory The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee ballots which in the past have favored Republican candidates Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in by a margin of to percent

Democrats argument If as the rationale goes both sides are to blame and the election ended in a tie then why cant we just have a compromise that affords both sides with a chance win the Presidency This would seem like a reasonable solution provided those underlying suppositions were true The problem for Gore is that the suppositions are not even close to being true Both sides are not to blame And this election while ridiculously close did not end a tie Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of the votes He has had that recount of votes When the recount upheld the original result that should have been the end of this fiasco However even before the original recount was finished Gore and his partner in crime Senator Lieberman decided in their minds that they really won the election What has followed has been their allout assault to change what happened on election day in Florida Full Column CommentarycomJMhtml AOL link a hrefEmail Update Signupa Paid for by Bush

Filling in Blanks on Ballots Buchanan Numbers Possible Democrats Urge Gore to Quit Legal Wrangling New York Times Washington Post Others Revote or Court Remedy Politically Unsound and Legally Questionable STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A BAKER III The American people voted on November Governor George W Bush won states with a total of electoral votes The vote in Florida was very close but when it was counted Governor Bush was the winner Now three days later the vote in Florida has been recounted Over twothirds of the state election supervisors overseeing the recount are Democrats At the end of this recount Governor Bush is still the winner subject only to counting the overseas ballots which have traditionally favored the Republican candidate No evidence of vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has been presented Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the recount It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly prolong the countrys national Presidential election through endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida Furthermore the more often ballots are recounted especially by hand the more likely it is that human errors like lost ballots and other risks will be introduced This frustrates the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to machine counting Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot There is a rule of law to be followed for elections The state of Florida has established legal procedures to design approve publish and if need be to protest ballots before the election The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor She approved it The Democratic Party did not question it before the election This butterflytype ballot was used in recent elections in the same county under the same rules Again the Democrats did not complain The overwhelming majority of voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot and we have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you to see The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that double marked ballots are not counted A key principle in America is one person one vote If we have ballots with two votes of course we cannot count them or guess about them Ballots that are doublemarked cant be evidence of the voters intent to vote one way or another No jurisdiction in the United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote and Florida law specifically does not It happens in every precinct in every election And the procedure is clear These ballots must be disregarded We understand and I understand personally that it is frustrating to lose by a narrow margin But it happens It happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in and Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the countrys interest first They accepted the vote for the good of the country It is important that there be some finality to the election process What if we insisted on recounts in other states that are very close For example in Wisconsin Iowa and if we dont win New Mexico Let the country step back a moment pause and think about whats at stake This may be the last chance There is no reasonable end to this process if it slips away The purpose of our national election is to establish a Constitutional government not unending legal wrangling We will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaigns efforts to keep recounting until it likes the result For the good of the country and the sake of our standing in the world the campaigning should end and the business of an orderly transition should begin STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won Floridas election and a recount has now confirmed his victory The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee ballots which in the past have favored Republican candidates Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in by a margin of to percent even though he lost the election in Florida We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts which could undermine the constitutional

Tuesday that state officials may cut off the vote recount in the states fiercely contested presidential election at pm EST Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or corrected totals after the deadline and Secretary of State Katherine Harris may consider them if she employs proper exercise of discretion A Proposal to End the Impasse in Florida A Summary Tuesday November Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney want to bring some finality to the election process in Florida They believe the American people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks The vote in Florida has been counted It has been recounted Both times Governor Bush has emerged the winner And there have been no allegations of vote fraud in either the count or the recount Confusion yes Fraud no Yet the Gore campaign refuses to accept the result Rather than accept the result the Gore campaign has demanded manual recounts in predominantly Democratic counties In fact the Gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly Democratic precincts in these counties to recount Broward County Precinct F votes for Gore for Bush Precinct F votes for Gore for Bush Precinct C votes for Gore for Bush This might lead to the conclusion that the Gore campaign is more focused on selectivity than fairness Even still Gore was only able to pick up four votes through the manual recounts of the three Gorechosen counties in Democratic Broward County Based on this small change in votes the Broward County canvassing board voted to not expand the manual recount to the entire county Yet now the Gore campaign wants to force Broward County officials to continue the manual count This is after they have talked for days about letting the local officials run the recounts And yesterday the Florida Secretary of State reiterated that Florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to certify its election returns by pm today Amazingly the Gore campaign has filed a lawsuit to block the application of the statute It seems the Gore campaign places great weight on Florida law only when they think it serves their tactics In sum the Gore campaign has been unwilling to accept any finality They refused to accept the first vote They refused to accept the recount They refused to accept the manual recounts in selective counties Thats why today Secretary James A Baker offered the following common sense proposal to solve the impasse Governor Bush has objected to the manual recount Vice President Gore has objected to todays pm deadline required by Florida law Governor Bush is therefore proposing to accept the manual recount up to todays pm deadline if Vice President Gore agrees This is fair proposal that will bring this divisive process to a reasonable conclusion Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker In earlier statements we have emphasized the importance of achieving some finality to the election process not just here in Florida but of course for the nation as a whole More and more we see uncertainty in financial markets and we see uncertainty abroad I believe that most observers whether at home or abroad are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until a candidate achieves the result he seeks The vote in Florida was counted and then it was recounted

one in million the chances of hitting Megabucks on one spin are slim but not as slim as the odds that Vice President Al Gore would make up as much ground as he has in the Florida recount according to a UNLV study Economics professor Tom Carroll began running statistical equations Thursday on the net gains both Gore who gained more than votes and Texas Gov George W Bush who added about votes have made in the recount He found that the statistical chances for such large and different totals to occur as a result of random glitches was less than infinitesimal The probability of being struck by

sunbinstoriesarchivesnovhtml Philadelphia Inquirer Gore might lose a second round Media suppressed the Bush vote John R Lott Jr With Floridas election results so close charges of voter confusion and intimidation fill the air Votes have been recounted and are being recounted yet again Because of the closeness of the race problems that have been ignored in the past are difficult to ignore now So what has created this incredible closeness The Gore campaign along with the media has focused on possible problems in Palm Beach county Supposedly had it not been for the spoiled ballots where voters cast more than two votes for president and the votes that Buchanan received there would have been a Gore victory But by now many have heard that the spoiled ballots are nothing new in Palm Beach where ballots suffered similar problems in the last presidential election Heavily Republican Duval County apparently had over similarly spoiled ballots Buchanans votes are actually not an anomaly With registered members of the American Reform Reform and Independent Parties Palm Beach is a hotbed of Reform party activity Indeed it has the second highest total Reform and Independent party membership of any county in the state Hillsborough County which comes in third lags behind with members Up to twothirds of Buchanans vote in Palm Beach can be explained simply by county differences in party registration A more important explanation for the close results exists By prematurely declaring Gore the winner shortly before polls had closed in Floridas conservative western Panhandle the media ended up suppressing the Republican vote Bush obtained over percent of the vote in the affected area With only votes separating the two candidates Friday morning even a few hundred discouraged votes

other five counties ranged from percent for McHenry to percent for Will according to a Chicago SunTimes analysis of last weeks vote Election officials in Cook County conceded the numbers were higher

elderly counter dropped to ballots over the floor creating a huge scene Other observers stepped on the ballots In two precincts the result has been so flawed that a second manual recount had to be conducted Counters are provided with no instruction and little guidance Because the Commission is canvassing at the same time that people count counters often roam the room with their hands in the air asking for guidance BROWARD COUNTY Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors for the county the next Steven Michaelson of the public defenders office admitted in court Friday that Democrats are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors Different standards at different tables There are untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors at the next table how to conduct the count Affidavits from Florida residents serving as Republican observers state that there is confusion multiple touching and passing of ballots between inspectors moving precinct ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were already being counted etc Conflicting statements A Broward County attorney said a manual count requires machine error yet the board reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count despite no machine problems Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no evidence of equipment problems and that he was surprised by the very small number of changes discovered for Gore Falling chad on the floor on the counting tables on chairs etc There is no reasonable assurance to voters that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure the integrity and security of the ballots The canvassing board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the counting until they do so Election officials

information gathering he says he is working independently of the Gore campaign Bill Daley the vice presidents campaign chairman has publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors I think there is a presumption that those members who are voting vote based upon the election he has said I believe the vast majority of them are legally bound And I would assume if youre legally bound you believe youre morally bound Anyone in politics knows opposition research is a polite synonym for digging up dirt The threat explicit in Beckels project is that the lives of electors are going to be examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to call on mostly Democrats but some Republicans too and ask Who are these electors and what do you know about them That is what blackmailers do too Democrats need to call today for Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does The presidential election

Bush Statement by James Baker III re FL Supreme Court Decision Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again Washington Post Send in the Thugs Gores Point Man Argued Against Dimples in Statement by Governor George W Bush November I am disappointed with last nights ruling by the Florida Supreme Court We believe the justices have used the bench to change Floridas election laws and usurp the authority of Floridas election officials We believe the court overreached Writing laws is the duty of the legislature administering laws is the duty of the executive branch Two weeks after the presidential election a court has decided that Floridas deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a deadline at all The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes that have already been counted at least two times and in some cases three or four times will continue more than a week after the law says it should And the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language But make no mistake the court rewrote the law It changed the rules and it did so after the election was over Full Statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by James Baker III Senior Advisor BushCheney Recount At Mondays oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court Justice Harding asked a key question about Floridas electoral laws and standards Is it right to change the rules in the middle of the game The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral boards have now decided to do just that Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count Dimpled Ballots So For the past week the Gore campaign has been saying that the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of this election But now that they didnt get a decision exactly to their liking the Gore campaign is backpedaling and saying that they will leave all their options open In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be counted as votes the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke case in Illinois but the Illinois case didnt talk about dimpled chads at all It involved hanging chads the standard that these three counties began using and the standard that they are now seeking to change There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas governing manual recounts In Texas this would all be over because Texas only allows one manual recount and it has very clear and objective standards The first of those is when you see light coming through and the second of those is where you have a hanging chad Its only in the third instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any consideration of a dimpled chad and it doesnt say that a dimpled chad can be considered standing alone It says it can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote With its decision the Florida Supreme Court has decided to change the rules in the middle of the game The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both the executive and legislative branches They effectively rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly belonged to the Florida Secretary of State This decision by seven Democrat justices completely politicizes the votecounting process by putting the fate of this election in the hands of the six Democrats two independents and only one Republican that control the Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual recounts In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this election the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the rules in three counties that are still conducting manual recounts Statistical experts have said that under the current standards Gore will not get enough votes to overcome Governor Bushs lead So now the Gore campaign is looking to change those standards in the middle of the process The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a slight indentation No hole in the ballot is necessary No single loose corner is necessary Not even seeing any light through the ballot is necessary This lenient standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent enough votes to overturn the election Ten years ago the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots should be counted that stated But a chad that is fully attached bearing only an indentation should not be counted as a vote Now Democrats want to unfairly change those rules The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes they need is to keep changing the rules This is unfair and unacceptable This election must be decided by the rules that existed on Election Day not the rules rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged environment two weeks later The Washington Post SEND IN THE THUGS Michael Kelly Excerpt Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida he will have come very very close to winning Moreover he will have done this with his imageskin more or less intact For Gore has already won an astonishing propaganda victory With the help of reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and liberal national press corps he has managed to spin his extraordinary radical unprecedented behavior as reasonable and legitimate This probably ensures that future close presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies of lawyers and thugs demanding recounts rewriting

reasonable people in the center are going to look at this and say Guys you had your shot the count the recount they changed the rules for you and you still did not win Its time to be magnanimous RE Governor Bushs Speech the tonewas perfect There was a persistence and a determination in what Governor Bush said but it was also incredibly conciliatory It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this and that probably goes to peoples hearts Bob Woodward on Larry King Live CNN STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W BUSH The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones As our nation watched we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of each and every vote We were reminded of the strength of our democracy that while our system is not always perfect it is fundamentally strong and far better than any other alternative The election was close but tonight after a count a recount and yet another manual recount Secretary Cheney and I are honored and humbled

process in Florida and in the country as a whole needed to conclude with fairness and finality I suggested that everyone step back pause and think about what was at stake I warned that there might be

COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD Democrat Member of Floridas Election Canvassing Commission Thank you Madam Secretary Let me first commend you on the job that you and your office have done during these last

stateand say whats going on down in Florida and I have to keep reminding people the only thing thats going on here is that weve got a razorthin election for the most important job in the world And thats all it is After all the jokes after all of the anguish weve just got a close election And any state that had to go through this wouldve had the same problems I think that we have had But I think its over It should be over And maybe thats the important word there should You know Yogi Berra once said Its not over till its over Well its over and we have a winner and its time to move on Theres one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough legal talent to keep this tied up through Christmas But one thing the lawyers cant do for us and one thing the courts cant do for us They cant bring this country together again And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight its going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together again and I hope we can

for George W Bush but Al Gore hasnt asked them to do anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done But I dont think hes in the position to say Oh by the way could you order some more recounts So I think there is nothing ifGore runs out of ammunition Which I think he may well do before the Supreme Court of the United States gets to a hearing I think he has to give up

the Bush Cheney Recount here ContributionContributioncfmAIDIVFFBXFAZHGH AOL contribution link at bottom Bush News Contents Talking Points to Set the Record Straight Statement by Secretary James A Baker III What Theyre Saying TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT MYTH There are more than votes in MiamiDade that have never been counted BOIES There are over ballots that have never been counted once for the presidency of the United States Today Show FACT Every ballot in MiamiDade was counted at least twice once on election night and again during the automatic recount In every election there are a significant number of ballots that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot including races for President For example in this election of the voters in Idaho of the voters in Illinois and of the voters in Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President The votes actually according to their filing about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only of the ballots cast in MiamiDade These ballots were counted twice they merely registered no vote for President This reality reflects common sense a voter may want to vote for a candidate for the Senate House or other office but be undecided about the choice for President In particular a voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates but be uncomfortable with his or her partys choice for President and yet unwilling to vote for the other partys candidate So he or she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for President MYTH If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the recount Gore would actually be ahead by votes FACT Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount from MiamiDade and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of the certified votes from Nassau County The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of pm on Sunday for completing manual recounts almost tripling the statutory time period for counting mandated by Floridas Legislature Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Courts deadline MiamiDade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with a manual recount The interim gain for Gore in MiamiDade came from a selective recount of the most Democrat precincts Gore won these selected precincts by approximately to while Gore won the entire county only by to It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican precincts too Precincts in MiamiDade including those with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters favored Bush The Gore approach would treat these minorities in a discriminatory fashion Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law should be counted Counties recognized this and counted them Even Joe Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected MYTH MiamiDade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican mob that intimidated the canvassing board KLAIN We think already almost votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the count But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility stop a count and then thats going to provide the end because a partisan of the Bush campaign Ms Harris refuses to accept returns and cuts off the counting I dont think thats the kind of end that we have to American elections Good Morning America ABC FACT The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Boards decision to move the recount behind closed doors where it could not be observed by the public or the media and to limit the recount to only a select set of the votes No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd The police made no arrests received no assault complaints and did not even instruct the crowd to desist The crowd was quieted promptly MYTH In Nassau County the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal FACT On election night all the votes were counted but during the machine recount ballots were accidentally separated from the rest and not counted As a result Bush received fewer votes and Gore received fewer votes than on election night After the recount the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her mistake and tried to correct it Because the Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final certification until Sunday at pm the Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count to make it accurate The Board Democrats and Republican voted unanimously to certify the original election night count which included the ballots rather than the machine recount total which mistakenly omitted those ballots STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A BAKER III Ladies and Gentlemen Regrettably the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit contesting the certified election results in Florida Their aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after days of counts and recounts As I said last night America has never had a presidential election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new uncertain and controversial territory Therefore I would now like to introduce the senior members of the litigation team who will be defending the vote of Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee Florida with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig Mr Richard a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of Florida has years of trial experience Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago Illinois Together they bring to this team years of practice as trial attorneys The other two members of our senior litigation team are law partners of mine at Baker Botts in Houston Texas Together Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have years of experience practicing in court These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize WHAT THEYRE SAYING Quotes from Democrats Its not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last legal limit to get the electionI dont think he should US Senator Russ Feingold DWisconsin Lacrosse Tribune US Rep Gene Taylor DBay St Louis Mississippi will vote for Texas Gov George W Bush if the presidential race is ultimately decided by the US House of Representatives I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth Congressional District voted And in this case Governor Bush carried my district The Mississippi Sun Herald Monday Indiana House Speaker John Gregg DSandborn called on Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election in doubt for days He needs to pick up the phone call Austin and say Mr President congratulations I support you as president percent Indianapolis Star Selfdescribed liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBCs Hardball with Chris Matthews Theyre talking about people that they said their votes didnt count There are other people in Florida whos votes were not counted that lie in George Bush countryMany many more are Bush votes and they dont say a word about that Quotes from Media Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channels Hannity and Colmes a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of thought and logic and argument You cannot say of the ballot just because nobody voted for Bush or Gore that its really a secret Gore vote that didnt get counted Saloncoms Joan Walsh His condescending singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was almost insulting Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBCs Imus in the Morning Imus What if Gore had won and BushI mean what if the roles were reversed how would I wouldnt want to include you in this but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be treating all this if the roles were reversed Fineman Oh my God you kidding That George Bush was a cry baby that he was the spoiled son of a failed President You know you can just here it The personal attacks on Bush would be just absolutely vicious Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC Connolly But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore that you sometimes get that has turned off many Americans over time And you also got a little bit of whining frankly when he started talking about voter intimidation Reid Some thought it very odd why they had all the photographers in there flashing It was a bit distracting And the flags some people think maybe its an overdose on the flags And another question a very formal setting for a very personal conversation with the American people Howard Fineman on MSNBC Fineman He Gore had to make clear to people that there was something about him some essential goodness in him that made it worth fighting this fight And when he said If I lose so be it he had to be convincing on that point And I must say after all the arguing in this very divided election its going to be hard for most Americans to agree with that most Americans think that this election was fair Hes got to make the case that it isnt and its hard for him to do it political terms Im not sure how much time he really has AOL contribution link a hrefContributionContributioncfmAIDIVFFBXFAZH GHContributea Paid for by Bush Cheney Recount To

half a million votes cast in Florida counties provide evidence that the presidential race was influenced by thousands of ineligible voters Nearly six million voters in Floridas counties cast ballots Nearly percent of the illegal ballots discovered by The Herald were cast by registered Democrats The votes could be seized upon by the Bush campaign to argue that a large number of illegal votes were

Democrats argument If as the rationale goes both sides are to blame and the election ended in a tie then why cant we just have a compromise that affords both sides with a chance win the Presidency

crowd was reacting to the Boards decision to move the recount behind closed doors where it could not be observed by the public or the media and to limit the recount to only a select set of the votes No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd The police made no arrests received no assault complaints and did not even instruct the crowd to desist The crowd was quieted promptly MYTH In Nassau County the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal FACT On election night all the votes were counted but during the machine recount ballots were accidentally separated from the rest and not counted As a result Bush received fewer votes and Gore received fewer votes than on election night After the recount the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her mistake and tried to correct it Because the Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final certification until Sunday at pm the Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count to make it accurate The Board Democrats and Republican voted unanimously to certify the original election night count which included the ballots rather than the machine recount total which mistakenly omitted those ballots STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A BAKER III Ladies and Gentlemen Regrettably the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit contesting the certified election results in Florida Their aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after days of counts and recounts As I said last night America has never had a presidential election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new uncertain and controversial territory Therefore I would now like to introduce the senior members of the litigation team who will be defending the vote of Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee Florida with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig Mr Richard a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of Florida has years of trial experience Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago Illinois Together they bring to this team years of practice as trial attorneys The other two members of our senior litigation team are law partners of mine at Baker Botts in Houston Texas Together Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have years of experience practicing in court These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize WHAT THEYRE SAYING Quotes from Democrats Its not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last legal limit to get the electionI dont think he should US Senator Russ Feingold DWisconsin Lacrosse Tribune US Rep Gene Taylor DBay St Louis Mississippi will vote for Texas Gov George W Bush if the presidential race is ultimately decided by the US House of Representatives I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth Congressional District voted And in this case Governor Bush carried my district The Mississippi Sun Herald Monday Indiana House Speaker John Gregg DSandborn called on Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election in doubt for days He needs to pick up the phone call Austin and say Mr President congratulations I support you as president percent Indianapolis Star Selfdescribed liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBCs Hardball with Chris Matthews Theyre talking about people that they said their votes didnt count There are other people in Florida whos votes were not counted that lie in George Bush countryMany many more are Bush votes and they dont say a word about that Quotes from Media Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channels Hannity and Colmes a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of thought and logic and argument You cannot say of the ballot just because nobody voted for Bush or Gore that its really a secret Gore vote that didnt get counted Saloncoms Joan Walsh His condescending singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was almost insulting Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBCs Imus in the Morning Imus What if Gore had won and BushI mean what if the roles were reversed how would I wouldnt want to include you in this but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be treating all this if the roles were reversed Fineman Oh my God you kidding That George Bush was a cry baby that he was the spoiled son of a failed President You know you can just here it The personal attacks on Bush would be just absolutely vicious Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC Connolly But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore that you sometimes get that has turned off many Americans over time And you also got a little bit of whining frankly when he started talking about voter intimidation Reid Some thought it very odd why they had all the photographers in there flashing It was a bit distracting And the flags some people think maybe its an overdose on the flags And another question a very formal setting for a very personal conversation with the American people Howard Fineman on MSNBC Fineman He Gore had to make clear to people that there was something about him some essential goodness in him that made it worth fighting this fight And when he said If I lose so be it he had to be convincing on that point And I must say after all the arguing in this very divided election its going to be hard for most Americans to agree with that most Americans think that this election was fair Hes got to make the case that it isnt and its hard for him to do it political terms Im not sure how much time he really has AOL contribution link a hrefContributionContributioncfmAIDIVFFBXFAZH GHContributea Paid for by Bush Cheney Recount To

our nation watched we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of each and every vote We were reminded of the strength of our democracy that while our system is not always perfect it is

Bush Statement by James Baker III re FL Supreme Court Decision Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again Washington Post Send in the Thugs Gores Point Man Argued Against Dimples in Statement by Governor George W Bush November I am disappointed with last nights ruling by the Florida Supreme Court We believe the justices have used the bench to change Floridas election laws and usurp the authority of Floridas election officials We believe the court overreached Writing laws is the duty of the legislature administering laws is the duty of the executive branch Two weeks after the presidential election a court has decided that Floridas deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a deadline at all The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes that have already been counted at least two times and in some cases three or four times will continue more than a week after the law says it should And the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language But make no mistake the court rewrote the law It changed the rules and it did so after the election was over Full Statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by James Baker III Senior Advisor BushCheney Recount At Mondays oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court Justice Harding asked a key question about Floridas electoral laws and standards Is it right to change the rules in the middle of the game The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral boards have now decided to do just that Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count Dimpled Ballots So For the past week the Gore campaign has been saying that the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of this election But now that they didnt get a decision exactly to their liking the Gore campaign is backpedaling and saying that they will leave all their options open In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be counted as votes the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke case in Illinois but the Illinois case didnt talk about dimpled chads at all It involved hanging chads the standard that these three counties began using and the standard that they are now seeking to change There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas governing manual recounts In Texas this would all be over because Texas only allows one manual recount and it has very clear and objective standards The first of those is when you see light coming through and the second of those is where you have a hanging chad Its only in the third instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any consideration of a dimpled chad and it doesnt say that a dimpled chad can be considered standing alone It says it can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote With its decision the Florida Supreme Court has decided to change the rules in the middle of the game The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both the executive and legislative branches They effectively rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly belonged to the Florida Secretary of State This decision by seven Democrat justices completely politicizes the votecounting process by putting the fate of this election in the hands of the six Democrats two independents and only one Republican that control the Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual recounts In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this election the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the rules in three counties that are still conducting manual recounts Statistical experts have said that under the current standards Gore will not get enough votes to overcome Governor Bushs lead So now the Gore campaign is looking to change those standards in the middle of the process The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a slight indentation No hole in the ballot is necessary No single loose corner is necessary Not even seeing any light through the ballot is necessary This lenient standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent enough votes to overturn the election Ten years ago the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots should be counted that stated But a chad that is fully attached bearing only an indentation should not be counted as a vote Now Democrats want to unfairly change those rules The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes they need is to keep changing the rules This is unfair and unacceptable This election must be decided by the rules that existed on Election Day not the rules rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged environment two weeks later The Washington Post SEND IN THE THUGS Michael Kelly Excerpt Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida he will have come very very close to winning Moreover he will have done this with his imageskin more or less intact For Gore has already won an astonishing propaganda victory With the help of reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and liberal national press corps he has managed to spin his extraordinary radical unprecedented behavior as reasonable and legitimate This probably ensures that future close presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies of lawyers and thugs demanding recounts rewriting the rules and the laws convincing more and more Americans that their electoral system is like those in most of the world just another rigged game Thanks Al we needed that Full Story

elderly counter dropped to ballots over the floor creating a huge scene Other observers stepped on the ballots In two precincts the result has been so flawed that a second manual recount had to be conducted Counters are provided with no instruction and little guidance Because the Commission is canvassing at the same time that people count counters often roam the room with their hands in the air asking for guidance BROWARD COUNTY Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors for the county the next Steven Michaelson of the public defenders office admitted in court Friday that Democrats are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors Different standards at different tables There are untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors at the next table how to conduct the count Affidavits from Florida residents serving as Republican observers state that there is confusion multiple touching and passing of ballots between inspectors moving precinct ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were already being counted etc Conflicting statements A Broward County attorney said a manual count requires machine error yet the board reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count despite no machine problems Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no evidence of equipment problems and that he was surprised by the very small number of changes discovered for Gore Falling chad on the floor on the counting tables on chairs etc There is no reasonable assurance to voters that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure the integrity and security of the ballots The canvassing board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the counting until they do so Election officials

Crossfire and campaign manager for Walter Mondales failed presidential bid may be engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since Watergate It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly appropriate Since the morning after the election there have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral College If Bush wins Florida he becomes president by one more electoral vote than the required If three Republican electors switch to Gore the Tennessean gains a majority and wins the White House According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere Beckel who has close ties to Gore recount team leader Warren Christopher is engaged in an opposition research project targeting Republican electors Calling his efforts information gathering he says he is working independently of the Gore campaign Bill Daley the vice presidents campaign chairman has publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors I think there is a presumption that those members who are voting vote based upon the election he has said I believe the vast majority of them are legally bound And I would assume if youre legally bound you believe youre morally bound Anyone in politics knows opposition research is a polite synonym for digging up dirt The threat explicit in Beckels project is that the lives of electors are going to be examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to call on mostly Democrats but some Republicans too and ask Who are these electors and what do you know about them That is what blackmailers do too Democrats need to call today for Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does The presidential election

Tuesday that state officials may cut off the vote recount in the states fiercely contested presidential election at pm EST Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or corrected totals after the deadline and Secretary of State Katherine Harris may consider them if she employs proper exercise of discretion A Proposal to End the Impasse in Florida A Summary Tuesday November Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney want to bring some finality to the election process in Florida They believe the American people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks The vote in Florida has been counted It has been recounted Both times Governor Bush has emerged the winner And there have been no allegations of vote fraud in either the count or the recount Confusion yes Fraud no Yet the Gore campaign refuses to accept the result Rather than accept the result the Gore campaign has demanded manual recounts in predominantly Democratic counties In fact the Gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly Democratic precincts in these counties to recount Broward County Precinct F votes for Gore for Bush Precinct F votes for Gore for Bush Precinct C votes for Gore for Bush This might lead to the conclusion that the Gore campaign is more focused on selectivity than fairness Even still Gore was only able to pick up four votes through the manual recounts of the three Gorechosen counties in Democratic Broward County Based on this small change in votes the Broward County canvassing board voted to not expand the manual recount to the entire county Yet now the Gore campaign wants to force Broward County officials to continue the manual count This is after they have talked for days about letting the local officials run the recounts And yesterday the Florida Secretary of State reiterated that Florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to certify its election returns by pm today Amazingly the Gore campaign has filed a lawsuit to block the application of the statute It seems the Gore campaign places great weight on Florida law only when they think it serves their tactics In sum the Gore campaign has been unwilling to accept any finality They refused to accept the first vote They refused to accept the recount They refused to accept the manual recounts in selective counties Thats why today Secretary James A Baker offered the following common sense proposal to solve the impasse Governor Bush has objected to the manual recount Vice President Gore has objected to todays pm deadline required by Florida law Governor Bush is therefore proposing to accept the manual recount up to todays pm deadline if Vice President Gore agrees This is fair proposal that will bring this divisive process to a reasonable conclusion Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker In earlier statements we have emphasized the importance of achieving some finality to the election process not just here in Florida but of course for the nation as a whole More and more we see uncertainty in financial markets and we see uncertainty abroad I believe that most observers whether at home or abroad are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts and recounts until a candidate achieves the result he seeks The vote in Florida was counted and then it was recounted

made in the recount He found that the statistical chances for such large and different totals to occur as a result of random glitches was less than infinitesimal The probability of being struck by

intimidation fill the air Votes have been recounted and are being recounted yet again Because of the closeness of the race problems that have been ignored in the past are difficult to ignore now So what has created this incredible closeness The Gore campaign along with the media has focused on possible problems in Palm Beach county Supposedly had it not been for the spoiled ballots where voters cast more than two votes for president and the votes that Buchanan received there would have been a Gore victory But by now many have heard that the spoiled ballots are nothing new in Palm Beach where ballots suffered similar problems in the last presidential election Heavily Republican Duval County apparently had over similarly spoiled ballots Buchanans votes are actually not an anomaly With registered members of the American Reform Reform and Independent Parties Palm Beach is a hotbed of Reform party activity Indeed it has the second highest total Reform and Independent party membership of any county in the state Hillsborough County which comes in third lags behind with members Up to twothirds of Buchanans vote in Palm Beach can be explained simply by county differences in party registration A more important explanation for the close results exists By prematurely declaring Gore the winner shortly before polls had closed in Floridas conservative western Panhandle the media ended up suppressing the Republican vote Bush obtained over percent of the vote in the affected area With only votes separating the two candidates Friday morning even a few hundred discouraged votes in addition to the cast in Floridas western panhandle could have made a crucial difference For the full article blueskyexnewsxexhowdemocratshtml Chicago SunTimes Many Partial spoiled ballots Scott Fornek and Abdon M Pallasch Cook Countyhome of the notorious butterfly ballotwas more likely than any other Chicago area county to have voters who skipped the presidential contest on their ballots last week or mistakenly chose more than one candidate City and suburban officials said of the people who cast ballots in the county either did not punch a choice in the top contest or spoiled their ballot for that race by punching more than one hole In Chicago the ballots represented percent of all ballots cast In suburban Cook the ballots were percent of the total Comparable figures in the other five counties ranged from percent for McHenry to percent for Will according to a Chicago SunTimes analysis of last weeks vote Election officials in Cook County conceded the numbers were higher than normal But they could not provide an explanation for the discrepancy or a breakdown so it was impossible to tell if the absence of votes was largely voluntary or a problem voters had with the

Filling in Blanks on Ballots Buchanan Numbers Possible Democrats Urge Gore to Quit Legal Wrangling New York Times Washington Post Others Revote or Court Remedy Politically Unsound and Legally Questionable STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A BAKER III The American people voted on November Governor George W Bush won states with a total of electoral votes The vote in Florida was very close but when it was counted Governor Bush was the winner Now three days later the vote in Florida has been recounted Over twothirds of the state election supervisors overseeing the recount are Democrats At the end of this recount Governor Bush is still the winner subject only to counting the overseas ballots which have traditionally favored the Republican candidate No evidence of vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has been presented Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the recount It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly prolong the countrys national Presidential election through endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida Furthermore the more often ballots are recounted especially by hand the more likely it is that human errors like lost ballots and other risks will be introduced This frustrates the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to machine counting Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot There is a rule of law to be followed for elections The state of Florida has established legal procedures to design approve publish and if need be to protest ballots before the election The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor She approved it The Democratic Party did not question it before the election This butterflytype ballot was used in recent elections in the same county under the same rules Again the Democrats did not complain The overwhelming majority of voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot and we have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you to see The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that double marked ballots are not counted A key principle in America is one person one vote If we have ballots with two votes of course we cannot count them or guess about them Ballots that are doublemarked cant be evidence of the voters intent to vote one way or another No jurisdiction in the United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote and Florida law specifically does not It happens in every precinct in every election And the procedure is clear These ballots must be disregarded We understand and I understand personally that it is frustrating to lose by a narrow margin But it happens It happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in and Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the countrys interest first They accepted the vote for the good of the country It is important that there be some finality to the election process What if we insisted on recounts in other states that are very close For example in Wisconsin Iowa and if we dont win New Mexico Let the country step back a moment pause and think about whats at stake This may be the last chance There is no reasonable end to this process if it slips away The purpose of our national election is to establish a Constitutional government not unending legal wrangling We will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaigns efforts to keep recounting until it likes the result For the good of the country and the sake of our standing in the world the campaigning should end and the business of an orderly transition should begin STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won Floridas election and a recount has now confirmed his victory The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee ballots which in the past have favored Republican candidates Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in by a margin of to percent even though he lost the election in Florida We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts which could undermine the constitutional process of selecting a President and has no foreseeable end Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau NORTH FLORIDA COUNTY TRIES TO FILL IN BLANKS ON BALLOTS partnerspbpostepapereditionstodaynewshtml Palm Beach News SUPPORTERS BUCHANAN NUMBERS POSSIBLE partnerspbdailynewsbuchananhtml DEMOCRATS URGE GORE TO QUIT LEGAL WRANGLING Senator John B Breaux a Louisiana Democrat questioned the Gore campaigns wisdom in challenging the Palm Beach result The right thing Mr Breaux said is to count the votes and respect the decision without lengthy litigation And Senator Robert G Torricelli Democrat of New Jersey warned against getting mired in the courts I want Al Gore to win the election Mr Torricelli told reporters but more than that I want somebody to win this election There is going to have to be a very compelling case for anybody to take this into a court of law The New York Times R W Apple Jr NEW YORK TIMES WASHINGTON POST OTHERS REVOTE OR COURT REMEDY POLITICALLY UNSOUND AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE The problem is that potential remedies such as a new election in Palm Beach County seem politically unsound and legally questionable The sad reality is that ballot disputes and imperfections are a feature of every election It will poison the political atmosphere if presidential elections in particular come to be seen as merely a starting point for litigation New York Times Editorial opinionFRIhtml We say yes to counting a little more but the legal action about which Mr Daley spoke elliptically should be approached with enormous caution and restraint Absent more than is currently known our sense is that either a lawsuit or a repeat vote would raise at least as many questions as it would likely resolve the courts in the end cant legitimize the results Washington Post Editorial wpdynarticlesANovhtml Some folks are even calling for a rerun of the Florida election It is important to decide this election by the rules that million Americans understood or should have understood when they entered the voting booth Tuesday This is not just about fair play for Al Gore and George W Bush It is about defending a system that regards votingday verdicts as the final word a concept that distinguishes this nation from most others in the world San Francisco Chronicle Editorial You know I dont think the ballot was a problem Bill and Ill tell you whyis that theres one section I dont know if people are really looking at which relates to electronic or electromechanical voting And in that particular case what the law says down here it says Voting squares may be placed in front of or in back of the names of candidates and statements CNNs Crossfire Greta Van Susteren If you start saying the ballot should be thrown out because of confusion I think that cases like that could be
