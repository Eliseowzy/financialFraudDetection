<17028141.1075845078780.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.new@enron.com,2001-05-17 15:10:00,PLEASE READ Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power Cc This mail is the third in the series regarding the acceptance of RiskTrac VaR for UK Power Please see the previous days which will provide the history Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen London Research have done it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the systems but not completely including the change in factor loadings the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the primary and secondary component curves in RiskTrac In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on That said does the VaR number sound right The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market The RiskTrac calculated m VaR is a day VaR and the methodology would imply it should be broken in business days Based on historical PLs this has not been the case and so it does not pass the sense check note that the original m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year There are many potential explanations why but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end ie only the first years and the component VarR for this period is in the order of m This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to jumps or shocks The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not captured in the current VaR calculation Outstanding issues work Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days weeks and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR number methodology being calculated employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the day earnings risk for out of days It would also be appropriate given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio to assess the fat tail risk being run I am away for the next weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates Forwarded by James NewLONECT on Stig NRON To James CT cc Tani CT Viacheslav CT Tanya nronXGate Kirstee CT Fergus nron Naveen nronXGate Mike E nronXgate Subject Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power Due to recent variances in UK Power VaR between the VaR spreadsheet SS model and RisktRAC RT despite small differences in Net Open Positions London Research and Risk Management have investigated these discrepancies with the results as below COB May data was chosen as a test example DPR RT NOP TWh VaR USD MM Summary of analysis for UK Power only Following checks of parameter and position inputs to the London VaR SS and a VaR recalc with appropriate inputs from RT the resultant VaR change does not seem to explain the discrepancies between RT and the SS VaR number Consideration of the term structure of the Net Open Positions in both RT and SS showed only minor differences Adhoc VaR calculation using SS positions run through RT The VaR obtained was comparable to the SS VaR Adhoc VaR run through RT with curve positions correctly mapped to the relevant price curves rather than aggregated to PPP curve Analysis of inputs to the London Spreadsheet SS VaR model PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ALL CHANGES WERE PERFORMED ON A STANDALONE BASIS ie one change made and then returned to original state before changing another variable Correlations Impact of RT correlations in SS NEW VAR USD MM Energy Trend ET correlations mapped to PPPWD as RT does not contain ET correlation data By keeping ET correlations the matrix became non positive definite and hence unusable for VaR model If the correlation matrix is larger ie takes into account more markets in RT as opposed to the SS this could also have a marginal effect mainly because the Cholesky factorisation will be different Factor loadings FIVE VERSUS SEVEN FACTOR LOADINGS SS uses rather than as per RT Houston Research Jaesoo Lew analysis has shown the effect of using five versus seven factor loadings Considering one of the primary curves as an example PWD Five factor loadings describe of the movement of the curve whereas seven factors describe Therefore the choice of whether to use or factors should not have a substantial impact on the VaR Impact of RT factor loadings in SS NEW VaR USD MMET Energy Trends curve with original factor loadings New VaR USD MM ET factor loadings mapped to PPP WD Volatilities Impact of RT volatilities in SS no change in VaR vols are the same Prices Impact of RT prices in SS no change in VaR prices are the same with the impact of rounding errors providing very small immaterial differences Positions Impact of RT positions in SS no change in VaR Forward forward volatilities Impact of utilising seasonality flag set to ON in SS NEW VaR USD MM In RT these are assumed to be ON constantly as are the fwd fwd volatilities due to using implied rather than historic vol inputs Impact of utilising fwd fwd vol flag set to OFF in SS NEW VaR USD MM The fwf fwd vol flag should be set to on in the SS model Combining different parameters The impact of RT correlations and RT factor loadings and several other combinations all gave changes to the VaR However the net result did not substantially differ from the results above in blue Other issues Intramonth positions not included in RT or SS for UKPower Primary and secondary curve mappings see below for Adhoc VaR results Currency conversion Prices are in GBP Does any term structure apply to GBPUSD FX forward curve used for transformation to USD VaR dollar Forward curve Therefore changing the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VaR between the two systems but NOT completely Checking differences in the term structure of positions UK Power Portfolio is fed from three different sources ET Elec positions are fed via a spreadsheet to the RT book UKPowerswap The Eastern books are also fed via spreadsheet into RT books called ESB ESB EXXEXX The UK Power book positions are uploaded directly from EnPower to the UK Power Portfolio in RT Differences ET ELEC none EnPower total difference of TWh of which is from June Eastern total difference of TWh for the ESB book only Misfeed causing this error now corrected AdHoc VaR Calculation Results Run Positions from the SS where ET Elec was mapped to WD VaR USD MM Run Positions from the SS where of ET Elec positions were mapped to the primary curves PPP Wd and WE curves VaR USD MM The VaR results obtained from Runs and are comparable with the VaR number from the SS The differences between these runs and the SS number can be attributed to parameter input variances as described above Run Positions from SS split into component curves ie SG NP NBP and PPP rather than aggregated into PPP curves ET Elec still split equally over the PPP positions VaR USD MM This is almost exactly in line with the headline UKPower VaR calculated through RT UK Power exposure composition TWh by curve price source PPP NBP NP SG Total Within the SS all positions from above ie TWh were mapped to the PPP curves whereas in RT all curves were mapped individually as secondary curves where PPP acts as primary curve even though PPP curve has smallest amount of price risk attached to it through having the smallest Net Open Position The adhoc results support the assumption that most of the RT VaR within the PPPNEW book is due to SG and NB rather than PPP The business may now want to consider the primary secondary relationships used within RT for UKPower based upon the net exposures against each curve Research suggests that SG should now become a primary curve based upon these results if price data is available for factor loading and correlation data analysis Further analysis on the impact of this change would be needed to quantify the effect of this As VaR at the confidence interval should typically represent expected losses over day for day in a day period backtesting should demonstrate this by illustrating a realised PnL loss greater than the VaR number However for UK Power the realised PnL losses have only exceeded the VaR approximately once over the last days By increasing the reported VaR number this may not seem appropriate given the underlying reasoning behind VaR and empirical evidence from backtesting It should be borne in mind that the current structure of the UK Power markets since the introduction of NETA has only been in operation for approximately days For this reason all data considered for either correlation or factor loading analysis should be considered with care The introduction of NETA into the UK Power market has necesserily created more risk to Enron especially until the market settles down and gains maturity and stability Therefore the revised UK Power VaR of USD MM is not entirely inappropriate although still appears a high number in absolute terms Research and Risk Management will investigate the underlying parameter levels during the next few days now that the core assumptions have been verified
