first round Were trying to get less confusing not more What we do not need is some major change in the draft methodology days before the draft The system that Kevin initially described is the fairest least confusing and works fine The franchise keepers including me should pick after those that do not keep anyone It best simulates the outcome of a nonfranchise snake draft Assuming the franchise keepers retain picks through of a true first round they would naturally pick last in a second round This system worked fine last year Dutch and Jeff have brought up ranking the franchise players instead of a nd random drawing for franchise keepers I would vote for that even though I would pick last in the st round th pick There are questions with players that might have been injured part of the year or otherwise but at least you know exactly where you stand I believe in using the snake draft and a nd drawing for franchise keepers but I would be fine with ranking the franchise players based on prior year Jeff Smith is just whining because he kept potentially the th overall player in Manning and would now potentially has Manning and the th pick This is a large sacrifice but this is Jeffs fault not the system Look at the other franchise players they are all in the top in most draft rankings Only Smith is complaining DeLuke To Smith Jeff Jeff FCCcomENRON

Franchise Players and the Draft The snake thing is good and bad But I think the first round should be randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental and then also at the top of the first round Theoretically the non keeper teams are getting the best players who are arguably also franchise players In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a lower level franchise player So they shouldnt get the an automatic shot at or whatever it might be as well So snake or no snake all of round one should be random order Original Message From Kiske Chris SMTP Sent Wednesday September PM To Kevin Ty Servello Mike Deluke Michael Currie Jody Spottswood Jeff Ullrich Smith Jeff Grant Johnson Dutch Quigley Dan Wienserski Chris Kiske Home BJ Naman Andy Reynolds Kiske Chris Subject RE Franchise Players and the Draft As the creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to eliminate the inherent advantage that the teams had by getting back to back picks every other round I think the time for mathematical preciseness has passed Im all for going to a simplified traditional snake system Frankly at this point I think there are as many disadvantages to being or or as advantages that it all works itself out Hell if it makes preparing for the draft any easier or administering the league Im for it PS Im for keeping TEs too Somewhere Rick is rolling over in his grave Original Message From Kevin mailto Sent Wednesday September PM To Ty Servello Mike Deluke

The following is the list of franchise players that have been kept Grant Johnson Eddie George Jeff Smith Peyton Manning Michael Deluke Marshall Faulk Michael Currie Edgerrian James Jeff Ullrich Kurt Warner I know this was brought up last year and we kind of decided much of nothingbut does anyone object to going to a snake system for the draft for the whole draft We will still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise players Then the nonfranchise teams will pick in opposite order of the supplemental round for round onethus if you pick first in the supplemental round you will pick last for those that did not keep franchise players in the first round Then the teams that kept franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first round After the first round the draft will snake back the other way with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the draft Let me know what you think or if you are confused See everyone at the draft Kevin This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and
