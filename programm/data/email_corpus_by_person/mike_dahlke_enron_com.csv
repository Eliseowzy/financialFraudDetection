PRC I would like each of you to prepare a list of accomplishments goals achieved etc Steve Per your July th request Performance Based Rates Analysis and Training for SKEnron The ultimate commercial objective is to establish a rate making framework for Korean gas distribution companies that will allow theJVs operating companies to retain profits derived from efficiency gains and earned returns that exceed the statuatory rate of return Analysis of several PBR mechanisms demonstrated the potential benefits from replacing the current Cost of Service framework with an incentive based system An eductional workshop based on the results of this analysis was organized and presented to Executive Financial and Regulatory staffs of the JV and its City Gas Companies Improved Cost of Service Rate Filing Procedures and Methods The commercial objective is to improve the results achieved by SKEnrons City Gas Companies when preparing and negotiating new rates under the current COS framework employed in Korea Several areas within the current framework where forwardlooking cost calculation methods could be employed to better match costs that will be incurred while new rates are in effect and the revenues earned were identified The need and benefit of determining the cost of service for each class of customer was also demonstrated Results of the analysis and methodology for determining COS by customer class was presented to the Executive Financial and Regulatory staffs of the JV and its CGCs Elimination of Dividend Restriction imposed on the City Gas Companies of SKEnron The commercial objective is to more effectively employ cash generated within the JVs CGCs by freeing these companies from a Ministry of Commerce Industry and Energy guideline limiting dividends to of each companys par stock value The initial approach was to develop a program that would consolidate all of the JVs CGCs into the Joint Venture company and thereby eliminate the need for dividends that would give the holding company access to opertating cash flows The regulatory implications of such an effort were analyzed and provided to the project team Opinion sampling of local regulators indicated strong opposition to such a strategy This insight plus tax issues of Enrons partner led to the conclusion that implementation of this strategy would be difficult A direct lobbying program to convince MOCIE to lift this guideline is currently being developed Feasibility of EnronOnLine launch in Korea The commercial objective is to create the opportunity for Korean companies to become customers of Enrons worldwide trading network Initial due diligence has established the feasibility of offering commodity products such as crude oil refined products and LPG and has identified issues the must be addressed with the Korean government to effectively deal in financial and weather derivatives Required Korean consents and other regulatory matters for Project Summer The commercial objective is to enhance Enron shareholder value Regulatory consents possibly required were identified and contractual issues with Enrons partner have been highlighted Gas transmission company ratemaking workshop for Korean Gas Company KOGAS and Korean Energy Economics Institute KEEI The commercial objective is to have Korea adopt an open access gas tranmission rate framework that is supportive of LNG marketing by Enron in Korea and improving gas supply cost of the JVs CGCs A workshop for representatives of KOGAS and KEEI was organized in Houston and introductions were made to the FERC staff in Washington DC The KEEI work product from its rate study effort has not been made available as of this date because of internal issues within KOGAS Keynote speaking role for APACHE CEO at Asia Pacific Economic Council Energy Ministers Meeting The commercial objective of this effort was to improve Enron APACHEs ability to shape policies relating to its business by raising the profile of its CEO amoung senior energy officials from throughout Asia Rebecca McDonald was one of three Key Note speakers for the opening of the conference She was accorded this honor even though Enron contributed a fraction of the financial support for the conference that several other energy companies did Her remarks on ecommerce and energy received considerable positive attention from many attendees including the Korean delegation Meeting with US Embassador to Korea The commercial objective was to improve Enrons chances of winning bids for energy assets particularly electric generation facilities scheduled to be privatized by the government A meeting was organized for myself SKEnrons Chief Operating officer and the JVs General Manager of Operations Based on the experience in bidding late in the Embassador was urged to advocate for more transparent and less subjective bid evaluation procedures that substantially increased the likelihood of closure on asset sales Ultimately sucessful privatization will create both asset acquisition and commodity marketing opportunities
