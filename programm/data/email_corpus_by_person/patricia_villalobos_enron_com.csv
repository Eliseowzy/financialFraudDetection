Finally The Truth on National TV Date Thu Nov PST Finally The Truth on National TV Billy Grahams daughter was being interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her How could God let something like this happen And Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response She said I believe that God is deeply saddened by this just as we are but for years weve been telling God to get out of our schools to get out of our government and to get out of our lives And being the gentleman that He is I believe that He has calmly backed out How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand that He leave us alone I know theres been a lot of an email going around in regards to but this really makes you think If you dont have time at least skim through it but the bottom line is something to think aboutIn light of recent eventsterrorists attack school shootings etc Lets see I think it started when Madeline Murray OHare she was murdered her body was found recently complained she didnt want any prayer in our schools and we said OK Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school the Bible that says thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal and love your neighbor as yourself And we said OK Then Dr Benjamin Spock said we shouldnt spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their selfesteem Dr Spocks son committed suicide and we said an expert should know what hes talking about so we said OK Then someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave And the school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we dont want any bad publicity and we surely dont want to be sued Theres big difference between disciplining and touching beating smacking humiliating kicking etc And we said OK Then someone said lets let our daughters have abortions if they want and they wont even have to tell their parents And we said OK Then some wise school board member said since boys will be boys and theyre going to do it anyway lets give our sons all the condoms they want so they can have all the fun they desire and we wont have to tell their parents they got them at school And we said OK Then some of our top elected officials said it doesnt matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs And agreeing with them we said it doesnt matter to me what anyone including the President does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good And then someone said lets print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome downtoearth appreciation for the beauty of the female body And we said OK And then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then stepped further still by making them available on the Internet And we said OK theyre entitled to their free speech And then the entertainment industry said lets make TV shows and movies that promote profanity violence and illicit sex And lets record music that encourages rape drugs murder suicide and satanic themes And we said its just entertainment it has no adverse effect and nobody takes it seriously anyway so go right ahead Now were asking ourselves why our children have no conscience why they dont know right from wrong and why it doesnt bother them to kill strangers their classmates and themselves Probably if we think about it long and hard enough we can figure it out I think it has a great deal to do with WE REAP WHAT WE SOW Dear God Why didnt you save the little girl killed in her classroom Sincerely Concerned Student AND THE REPLY Dear Concerned Student I am not allowed in schools Sincerely God Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the worlds going to hell Funny how we believe what the newspapers say but question what the Bible says Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe think say or do anything the Bible says Funny how someone can say I believe in God but still follow Satan who by the way also believes in God Funny how we are quick to judge but not to be judged Funny how you can send a thousand jokes through email and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord people think twice about sharing Funny how the lewd crude vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace but the public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace Funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week Are you laughing Funny how when you go to forward this message you will not send it to many on your address list because youre not sure what they believe or what they will think of you for sending it to them Funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me Are you thinking Pass it on if you think it has merit If not then just discard itno one will know that you did But if you discard this thought process then dont sit back and complain about what a bad shape the world is in God Bless America
