items and even thought up a new enhancement ie UNDO key but feel free to add to this list I have not sent this to Madup Kumar yet so just delete this message and forward to him I hope this isnt too harsh towards Sasha but I wanted to get the point across regarding the PS message at the bottom I really hope that they can complete these changes It would make life much easier Joe Capasso Madup In reference to Eterra I have prioritized some enhancements to the system that will improve its usage and accuracy When using Eterra some tasks are difficult to complete and can result in mismatches in the Ercot Portal I will identify some of the difficult tasks and I will make some suggestions on enhancements In addition I realize that we are working with time constraints and limited personnel I will categorize the list based on Priority Priority Very important and needs to be completed immediately Priority Important and needs to be completed within the next days Priority Moderate importance easy tasks can be completed at programmers convenience Priority A Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades such as a simultaneous Buy from Counterparty A in the South Zone and a Sell to Counterparty B in the North Zone Currently this has to be done by entering two trades a purchase from Counterparty A South Zone to the Hourly Ercot Book and a second trade a sell from the Hourly Ercot Book to Counterparty B I realize that we have a problem with the transmission between the North and South Zones and that is what makes this a difficult enhancement PriorityB Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation The current process is to input a buy from Frontera and a sell to Frontera This is not very intuitive and causes some confusion Why cant we input a buy from Frontera just as we would with any other trade It could be as simple as clicking a box to indicate that Frontera ie EPMI should be adjusted on the resource side and not EPMI on the obligation side PriorityC Eterra should not write over any trades that were input manually into the Ercot Portal Is there any way that we can make it identify a trade that was input manually into the portal When it finds one then it should not overwrite this trade PriorityA Undo Button On various occasions we have sent Bal Day trades to the QSE MOSErcot Portal and it was not the result that we had expected Therefore the trader has to manually change each of the trades This can be a very time consuming process Is there a way to have an UNDO button similar to the Excel UNDO key to retract the trade information from the QSE MOS or Portal PriorityB Change the short name in internal counterparty external counterparty to the actual long name ie elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy Reason It is just difficult to read I brought this up with Sasha and he said it would be a quick fix but it is still not done ProirityA Please give us a list of the Counterparties and their appropriate QSE names ie El Paso Merchant is actually APX This helps us identify what it will effect in the QSE MOS and Portal for example elpasomeren is converted into APX But does ELP or ELPASELECOM convert to APX also PriorityB Match Flow Period to automatically update the Contract Date This is one less step that we need to worry about The above mentioned enhancements will allow us to quickly and accurately update the QSE MOS Ercot Portal In addition it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs If you need additional clarification on any of these topics I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further I will be working days on Monday Nov th Thursday Nov th Thanks Joe Capasso PS Below is an email that outlines my conversation with Sasha on November rd Unfortunately none of the quick fixes have been completed yet Original Message From Capasso Joe Sent Saturday November PM To Forney John M Cc McElreath Alexander Olinde Jr Steve Phillips George Oh SeungTaek Subject Eterra John I met with Sasha today for approx hours We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra the top of the list is the highest priority Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine South Zone and a Sell to FPL North Zone Currently this has to be done by entering two trades a purchase from Calpine South Zone to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book to FPL North Zone Sasha said he is working on this but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that it is a purchase from Frontera Essentially this would increase the EPMI mws in the Ercot Portal Change the short name in internal counterpary external counterparty to the actual long name ie elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE ie El Paso Merchant is actually APX So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date One less step that we need to worry about I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading time is of the essence and that we dont have much time to input data Therefore we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly I realize that the first two items will take some time but the last items should be quick fixes I hope this helps Joe Capasso
