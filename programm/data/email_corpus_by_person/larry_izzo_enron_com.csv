on August of this year abo ut the million settlement payment that the SECLP project in the Dominica n Republic owes us and that they have not paid and that has been accruing interest for years EECC will have to write off all of this amount unless some resolution is achieved The email tells the story so I wont repeat it but will just update the note as follows After we sent this note there were several internal Enron meetings between EECC and CALME in which it was decided that Dan Castagnola would approach t he lenders in a last ditch attempt to obtain payment If the Lenders refused t o approve payment then EECC would be freed to file litigation against SECLP to recover the full uncompromised amount of the claim approx million excluding interest This project was then transferred to Global Markets in connection with the CALME breakup and the owners efforts to discuss the matter with the Lende rs seems to have ground to a halt We do not think that the discussion with th e Lenders ever occurred However we are still willing to consider alternatives to litigation such as selling the claim to the Enron shareholder in SECLP for the amount of the settlement and allowing the Enron shareholder company to hold and control the claim against the project and perhaps have it treated as a capital contribution for which shares might be issued later This would allow EECC to clean up its books without taking a write off and allow the Enron sharehold er to preserve the claim and perhaps capitalize it Please call me when you have had a chance to review this note Hopefully w e can work something out LI Larry L Izzo PM To David HaugENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc John SchwartzenburgENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject David as you know we have been trying to get the open claim we have with SECLP settled for some years now I am sending you this note as part of a last effort to get this settled and so it is to be considered part of the settlement discussions and used solely in that context and is without prejudice For you convenience I wanted to summarize the history of the dispute involving the outstanding invoice dated March from Enron Power Construction Company EPCC to SmithEnron CoGeneration Limited Partnership Owner in the amount of Claim Project History November Owner and GE execute the Turnkey Agreement November NTP issued to GE May Phase I Simple Cycle Commercial Operation achieved September Owner and EPCC execute the Construction Completion Agreeme nt CCA August Phase II Combined Cycle Commercial Operation achieved The Construction Completion Agreement Under the CCA EPCC administered the final stage of the Turnkey Agreement by stepping into the shoes of Owner in order to manage the schedule for completion of the work under the Turnkey Agreement It is important to remember that i EPCC had no authority to settle disputes or determine if the Commercial Operation was achieved and ii EPCC had no warranty obligations for GE or any other third person The Costs under the Invoice Between August and March EPCC continued to incur costs including additional scope of work items and costs incurred as a result of third part y actions Force Majeure Our costs totalled and were included i n the March invoice Since we have not been paid interest has been accruing on that amount Settlement Discussions Beginning Q I personally had discussions with Owner about the Claim We discussed several payout options most involving insurance proceeds EP CC and your partner Smith Cogeneration Dominicana Inc executed a settlement agreement in early This was negotiated personally by Rod Gray on behalf of EI However Owner refused to execute the settlement agreement pending Lender approval This Lender approval never materialized and the settlement agreement was never signed by the Owner However I was asked b y Rod on behalf of EI to await the insurance settlementThe settlement agreement stated that Owner would pay EPCC MM as follows of Owner insurance proceeds ie of Owners for the first MM gross insurance max is k and of Owners insurance proceeds ie of Owners above MM until EECC obtains MM Meanwhile we have patiently waited to close out the CCA while Owner resolv ed its claims against the responsible parties including RaytheonEbasco Gener al Electric and Foster Wheeler We have spent considerable time and effort investigating and addressing issues raised with respect to these liability issues even to the point of allowing our personnel to be interviewed We have waited so long that we had to execute a Tolling Agreement on August in order to protect our rights from disappearing due to lack of prosecution Finally in June your team suggested that the Lenders may consent to t he settlement agreement if we sent a stern letter outlining our position and evidencing our frustration Our litigation counsel drafted and sent such a letter on June but Lenders did not consent to the settlement agreement Current Status We now have no prospect of repayment of the Claim and no path forward EPC C is prepared to move forward and initiate appropriate proceedings for collection of this long overdue outstanding balance but I wanted to give y ou this letter as notice in case you had another solution to this dilemma Please note that the CCA allows for a per annum interest charge on all unpaid amounts and we will include four years at this rate in the arbitrati on claim Please respond with your thoughts and comments I look forward to discussi ng this matter with you Larry LI

Brown and Root Let me try and answer that and at the same time provide my recommendations on how EECC should evolve inside the new Enron a Enron does not need EECC however Enron has realized extra value from the EECC model since b EECC has taken an Enron liability construction risk and turned it into an asset net income The risk was incurred by Enrons decision to build assets around the world c Enron could have outsourced most or all of its engineering and construction management since but for about the same market price and contract value EECC has performed this work and accumulated over MM of net income for Enron d In addition EECC has performed the work generally in a manner superior to the rest of the industry We have avoided disasters experienced by Brown and Root Black and Veatch Snamprogetti Raytheon and Stone and Webster which presumably could have occurred while performing Enrons work Weve out performed them because we had better risk management skills e Cost avoidance In addition to performing this work at market price and at the same time making MM net income as Jack Urquhart pointed out at the last Board meeting we have avoided tens and tens of millions of dollars of extra cost during execution The Enron portfolio of construction risks averages in billions of dollars so even or percent in nuisancetype change orders from outside contractors would have added up to substantial extra costs f ROIC as we recognized the Enron deal flow was decreasing we were asked in the last two to three budget cycles to maintain or grow our net income Therefore we embarked on nonEnron thirdparty construction business This marginal income has increased our use of working capital Still this years return on all our working capital will be about down from last year but still a average over two years which is not unreasonable You asked about the details of our working capital Im scheduled to brief you on Oct g Internal flexibility there have been many instances over the years where having an internal contractor has enhanced the ability of an Enron developer to close the deal For example on the Peakers although other companies have outsourced the same type of work I assure you that because of the late start getting going by the Enron developers having to outsource would of easily cost us four to six weeks of summer revenues on the schedule On our current Dabhol LNG project an outside turnkey contractor would never be motivated to try and maintain the current schedule given the weaknesses in the Owners contractual positions including quarry suitability and subsea surface rock surprises etc Many other examples abound h Downsizing risks I think the risk to Enron of what happens to a large EECC in the event of downsizing during a market cycle is misconceived EECC in Houston has about employees many of whom are accountants lawyers contract specialists program managers all of whom have skill sets which are in demand in other Enron business units Therefore any downsizing of EECC if done over a reasonable period of time should be able to avoid a significant severance cost risk Nevertheless as Enron changes to a lessasset dependent company and because of the current value in monetizing assets the need for change is necessary I think it is important to agree on a clear plan and brief our employees all of whom are stressed by the uncertainty of where theyre going This will have a negative impact on the companys performance unless addressed My recommendations for evolving EECC is as follows a Sell NEPCO and phase out other nonEnron thirdparty lump sum work already ongoing b Define a slice of EECC in Houston as NEPCOHouston and package this with the NEPCO sell A buyer might value the EECCHouston expertise in cogeneration and gasrelated services c Finish the Enron work now under contract which will take from one to two years d Continue to selfperform any new Enron work in the future which I see centered in North America Europe and possibly Brazil where assets may be required to enhance the Enron networks being developed for trading purposes I think it would be a mistake to allow the decentralized business units to attempt to manage outside EPC contractors without a residual Center of Excellence EECC e Move EECC inside EES allowing EES to take advantage of a continued income stream from EECC A subsequent step would be to merge the infrastructure between EES Global Services and EECC f Slowly downsize the company as the current work evolves and the work load permits g Continue to develop engineering services for customers without taking construction risks but taking advantage of our reputation for due diligence and risk mitigation I think this effort could fit well inside EES as another service provided by Enron h Continue EECCs initiative to develop an Ecommerce revenue stream currently being undertaken in coordination with Enron Networks but relying on EECCs intellectual capital lessons learned and contacts in the industry I think we have good potential for this opportunity which is actively underway In summary EECCs assets are the intellectual capital of its people and the collective systems and procedures it has developed Both can continue to provide value to Enron inside EES Ive been discussing details with Lou and Joe but I strongly recommend we agree on a clearly defined plan and allow me to communicate it to our employees LI
