nron Iona CT Katy CT Vance NRON John AmblerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peggy ES cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires cheryl owjon

Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists Already relative to other areas naturalgas prices have inched higher in New England where naturalgas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by cents to per million BTUs said a spokeswoman for Distrigas a unit of Belgiums Tractebel SA But the lack of LNG isnt likely to become a big issue until winter hits and naturalgas storage is used up Richard Grant CEO of Distrigas says LNG has a year safety record at the companys Everett Mass terminal While LNG is flammable he says it is unlikely to explode He adds that there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual But until we answer the concerns we wont be able to bring a ship in here Deutsche Banc Alex Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourthquarter projections for naturalgas prices last week Prior to Sept we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back said Jay Saunders a Deutsche Banc analyst But all that is out the window now Deutsche Banc is now estimating a drop in winter demand in the industrial sector which accounts for more than a quarter of total US naturalgas consumption The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage which is on pace to be full by the end of October While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future naturalgas demand is met Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms such as EOG Resources Inc plan to moderate production in the next two months Gas drillingrig counts fell to last week from at the end of August Even with the increased naturalgas drilling of earlier this year overall naturalgas supply is expected to increase just this year as the countrys mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence Still the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form With prices high last winter El Paso Corp and Enron Corp among others said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas which is gas compressed and frozen to minus degrees Fahrenheit You will see some cancellations and some delays predicts Marshall Adkins an analyst with Raymond James Associates in Houston Naturalgas prices need to average per million BTUs on the East Coast and on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas said Ronald Barone an analyst with UBS Warburg A spokeswoman for El Paso Houston says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the US market Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank Freny Patel MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in BandraKurla Complex Enron has been able lease out square feet of it to Citibank NA Against an expected realisation from Rs crore for the outright sale of its four floors Enron will get around Rs crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant Cushman Wakefield at a monthly rental of Rs per square foot With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income Enron had eyed a deal of Rs crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs per square foot This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs to Rs per square feet In June the US energy giant had shelled out Rs crore when it acquired the four floors plus car park space from Wockhardt the pharmaceutical company The deal was struck at Rs per sq ft and included parking space for cars Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs crore to acquire the property and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired In order for it to break even it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs per square foot Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase he added Moreover the inefficiency of the

Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production By Alexei Barrionuevo Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc In the wake of last months terrorist attacks naturalgas prices have slid below per million British thermal units frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in naturalgas projects Analysts predict that with prices at current levels projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the US could be shelved or canceled Naturalgas prices which reached highs of nearly per million BTUs last December had held to around to per million BTUs for much of the year At per million BTUs and below producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electricutility demand Nearby November futures fell cents

Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production By Alexei Barrionuevo Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc In the wake of last months terrorist attacks naturalgas prices have slid below per million British thermal units frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in naturalgas projects Analysts predict that with prices at current levels projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the US could be shelved or canceled Naturalgas prices which reached highs of nearly per million BTUs last December had held to around to per million BTUs for much of the year At per million BTUs and below producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electricutility demand Nearby November futures fell cents yesterday to on the New York Mercantile Exchange In the Boston area however different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region Last week the US Coast Guard under pressure from local lawmakers indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor LNG makes up of New Englands gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists Already relative to other areas naturalgas prices have inched higher in New England where naturalgas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by cents to per million BTUs said a spokeswoman for Distrigas a unit of Belgiums Tractebel SA But the lack of LNG isnt likely to become a big issue until winter hits and naturalgas storage is used up Richard Grant CEO of Distrigas says LNG has a year safety record at the companys Everett Mass terminal While LNG is flammable he says it is unlikely to explode He adds that there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual But until we answer the concerns we wont be able to bring a ship in here Deutsche Banc Alex Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourthquarter projections for naturalgas prices last week Prior to Sept we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back said Jay Saunders a Deutsche Banc analyst But all that is out the window now Deutsche Banc is now estimating a drop in winter demand in the industrial sector which accounts for more than a quarter of total US naturalgas consumption The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage which is on pace to be full by the end of October While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future naturalgas demand is met Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms such as EOG Resources Inc plan to moderate production in the next two months Gas drillingrig counts fell to last week from at the end of August Even with the increased naturalgas drilling of earlier this year overall naturalgas supply is expected to increase just this year as the countrys mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence Still the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form With prices high last winter El Paso Corp and Enron Corp among others said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas which is gas compressed and frozen to minus degrees Fahrenheit You will see some cancellations and some delays predicts Marshall Adkins an analyst with Raymond James Associates in Houston Naturalgas prices need to average per million BTUs on the East Coast and on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas said Ronald Barone an analyst with UBS Warburg A spokeswoman for El Paso Houston says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the US market Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank Freny Patel MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in BandraKurla Complex Enron has been able lease out square feet of it to Citibank NA Against an expected realisation from Rs crore for the outright sale of its four floors Enron will get around Rs crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant Cushman Wakefield at a monthly rental of Rs per square foot With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income Enron had eyed a deal of Rs crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs per square foot This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs to Rs per square feet In June the US energy giant had shelled out Rs crore when it acquired the four floors plus car park space from Wockhardt the pharmaceutical company The deal was struck at Rs per sq ft and included parking space for cars Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs crore to acquire the property and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired In order for it to break even it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs per square foot Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase he added Moreover the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super builtup area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises and Enrons proposition continues to go abegging said the consultant

built a highgrowth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in April In these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest

where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman

York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia

the Hispanic community Monday pitching the million plan to a grassroots group of Latino leaders More than community activists and leaders precinct judges and civicassociation members attended an informational meeting and getoutthevote rally for the Nov arena referendum The rally was sponsored by the Lets Build It Together political action committee By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this it empowers us said Celina GarzaRidge a Harris CountyHouston Sports Authority director Its very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference and we are exactly in that position George Postolos the Houston Rockets chief operating officer said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community The proarena committee headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan and Ken Lay Enron chairman and chief executive officer does not want a repeat of the referendum Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues The Rockets made a percent participation commitment similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field to fairly share the new arenas design and construction jobs with minorities and women The team also promised to distribute up to a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to each to worthy grassroots nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in innercity Houston The new program targets the Hispanic community Postolos said The new arena plan is being endorsed by a crosssection of Latino leaders including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez state Rep Mario Gallegos the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city and the Hispanic community is getting more tangibles this time around He said When you consider that our community will get percent affirmative action that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community Mercedes Alejandro who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston heard the details of the plan for the first time Its good if it creates jobs for the community and opportunities to rebuild the community she said We want it to be good for the whole not the few Humberto Barrera president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization was critical of Hispanic leaders not the arena plan I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers health care and public safety than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs Barrera

Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones The nations top two power providers are battling in a US court over an unexecuted power sales agreement The Tennessee Valley Authority TVA has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of Enron Corp ENE alleging breach of a power sales contract TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the governmentowned utilitys inability to meet its debtreduction forecast According to the documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires the alleged breach of contract contributed to a million shortfall during fiscal year TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case which is under a court protective order A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract said David Smith TVAs chief financial officer when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVAs distribution utility customers But after consulting with attorneys Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the US District Court in Chattanooga Tenn in February stemming from a dispute over a longterm sales agreement an Enron spokesman said Monday In March TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract a TVA spokesman said Monday But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract or to elaborate further on the dispute citing the judges protective order TVA said Enron sought the court seal The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houstonbased energy giant and TVA a governmentowned utility that ranks among the largest US power producers The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative US Midwest power market which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of and After the summer of in which power that typically sells for between and per megawatthour spiked as high as per megawatthour Enron cited a study showing that TVAs power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward Enron built gasfired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVAs system After the summer of saw a repeat in extreme price volatility Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utilitys handling of transmissionaccess requests But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVAs transmission service In February Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the governments help charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enrons requests were gathering dust Enron later dropped the matter saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of

the Hispanic community Monday pitching the million plan to a grassroots group of Latino leaders More than community activists and leaders precinct judges and civicassociation members attended an informational meeting and getoutthevote rally for the Nov arena referendum The rally was sponsored by the Lets Build It Together political action committee By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this it empowers us said Celina GarzaRidge a Harris CountyHouston Sports Authority director Its very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference and we are exactly in that position George Postolos the Houston Rockets chief operating officer said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community The proarena committee headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan and Ken Lay Enron chairman and chief executive officer does not want a repeat of the referendum Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues The Rockets made a percent participation commitment similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field to fairly share the new arenas design and construction jobs with minorities and women The team also promised to distribute up to a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to each to worthy grassroots nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in innercity Houston The new program targets the Hispanic community Postolos said The new arena plan is being endorsed by a crosssection of Latino leaders including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez state Rep Mario Gallegos the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city and the Hispanic community is getting more tangibles this time around He said When you consider that our community will get percent affirmative action that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community Mercedes Alejandro who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston heard the details of the plan for the first time Its good if it creates jobs for the community and opportunities to rebuild the community she said We want it to be good for the whole not the few Humberto Barrera president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization was critical of Hispanic leaders not the arena plan I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers health care and public safety than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs Barrera

Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones The nations top two power providers are battling in a US court over an unexecuted power sales agreement The Tennessee Valley Authority TVA has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of Enron Corp ENE alleging breach of a power sales contract TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the governmentowned utilitys inability to meet its debtreduction forecast According to the documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires the alleged breach of contract contributed to a million shortfall during fiscal year TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case which is under a court protective order A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract said David Smith TVAs chief financial officer when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVAs distribution utility customers But after consulting with attorneys Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the US District Court in Chattanooga Tenn in February stemming from a dispute over a longterm sales agreement an Enron spokesman said Monday In March TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract a TVA spokesman said Monday But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract or to elaborate further on the dispute citing the judges protective order TVA said Enron sought the court seal The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houstonbased energy giant and TVA a governmentowned utility that ranks among the largest US power producers The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative US Midwest power market which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of and After the summer of in which power that typically sells for between and per megawatthour spiked as high as per megawatthour Enron cited a study showing that TVAs power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward Enron built gasfired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVAs system After the summer of saw a repeat in extreme price volatility Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utilitys handling of transmissionaccess requests But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVAs transmission service In February Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the governments help charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enrons requests were gathering dust Enron later dropped the matter saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the Albatross the only pub in the only village Edinburgh of the Seven Seas For a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it Not the islands colonial masters in London Not the Governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live miles away on St Helena Tristan da Cunhas nearest neighbour St Helena is Manhattan to Tristans Weehawken New Jersey Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa Tristan da Cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so Now thats living off the grid The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in and its been a Crown colony since populated by a handful of families from the Scottish borders There are just seven surnames on the island Glass Green Hagan Lavarello Repetto Rogers and Swain All of them turned up in London years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the Imperial capital In the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital You can build a hospital for under quid Amazing Otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things While theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a South African fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand Xray machine when it sails next week Now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what George W Bush amusingly calls the great state of California Once upon a time California was like they say of Tristan da Cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the North American continent Today with a population the size of Canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of Americas biggest industry entertainment But inside many a studio vicepresident is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out Deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the Tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try And therein lies the

Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the

traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the

nron Iona CT Katy CT Vance NRON John AmblerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peggy ES cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires cheryl owjon

Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the Albatross the only pub in the only village Edinburgh of the Seven Seas For a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it Not the islands colonial masters in London Not the Governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live miles away on St Helena Tristan da Cunhas nearest neighbour St Helena is Manhattan to Tristans Weehawken New Jersey Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa Tristan da Cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so Now thats living off the grid The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in and its been a Crown colony since populated by a handful of families from the Scottish borders There are just seven surnames on the island Glass Green Hagan Lavarello Repetto Rogers and Swain All of them turned up in London years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the Imperial capital In the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital You can build a hospital for under quid Amazing Otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things While theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a South African fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand Xray machine when it sails next week Now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what George W Bush amusingly calls the great state of California Once upon a time California was like they say of Tristan da Cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the North American continent Today with a population the size of Canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of Americas biggest industry entertainment But inside many a studio vicepresident is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out Deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the Tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try And therein lies the contradiction Californias selfinflicted energy crisis has exposed the preposterousness of poseurconservationism in a booming economy Which state has the most rigorous conservation program California Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption California And which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts By now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that conservation is not a viable policy for a nonstagnant economy Instead a rolling blackout here a rolling blackout there and theyre running around like headless chickens Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at everyone in sight Bush and Cheney are irresponsible the power generators are unconscionable no wait theyre snakes and robber barons And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay CEO of Enron Corp I would love said Bill Lockyer Californias AttorneyGeneral to personally escort Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey As the states AttorneyGeneral Mr Lockyer cannot summarily sentence citizens to anal rape but no doubt once the guys convicted he can make some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates Fortunately for Mr Lay as chief exec of the worlds largest energy trader he doesnt live in California he lives in Texas Indeed very few of the folks the State of California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia whose BC Hydro has been living high off the hog on Californias woes could also use a little light buggery but I cant see a Canadian court approving extradition Nevertheless in a state thats overregulated bans new power plants and is addicted to price caps Mr Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to Lalaland California bought into the softeco Sierra Club illusion that somehow one could be a conservationist with no consequences for ones economic wellbeing To put it in terms Californians can understand Suppose you build a house out in the desert But you dont want to buy a car because thats bad for the environment isnt it So instead every morning you call a taxicab in the city to drive out pick you up and take you into the office Not only does it have no environmental benefit but theres no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas Yet thats what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding price caps Through its own incompetence California is wholly dependent on energy generators and distributors from other jurisdictions But it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service California ie Hollywood and Silicon Valley as an act of public welfare A profit is swinelike piggish and totally unreasonable says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange She may have a point but if Californias going to institute price caps they might like to start closer to home After all if Enrons board members dont really need those big salaries do Paramounts or Universals I mean sure Ken Lay has an easy job but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every couple of months I mean surely the guy could do the job on oh a year And thatd be good for conservation cause hed have to give up the Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus And how about Travolta Instead of million per picture maybe he could get by on just two or three and the remaining million could be put into those renewable energy projects hes so keen on I mean a million salary isnt just swinelike its piggish right Since its entry into the Union California has had what we thcentury imperialists call responsible government Tristan da Cunha doesnt Yet its community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than Californias Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him Youre on your own man And if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous they should try spending a week in the dark cut off from the outside world and knowing that even when the radio starts working again its going to take months for the secondhand Xray machine to arrive

on PM From Ann M Schmidt PM To Mark NRON Karen NRON Meredith NRON Steven J nron Elizabeth nron Eric NRON Laura nron Jeannie CT Mary NRON Damon HarveyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Keith nron Richard nron James D nron Iona CT Katy CT Vance NRON John AmblerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peggy ES cc Subject DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing DJ Enron Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing New York By Cheryl Devoe Kim Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires cheryl owjon
<13303812.1075842073204.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,eric.thode@enron.com,2001-06-20 04:13:00,National Post Columnleast some reporterscolumnists get it This is a column from the National Post in Canada Eric Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the Albatross the only pub in the only village Edinburgh of the Seven Seas For a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it Not the islands colonial masters in London Not the Governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live miles away on St Helena Tristan da Cunhas nearest neighbour St Helena is Manhattan to Tristans Weehawken New Jersey Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa Tristan da Cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so Now thats living off the grid The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in and its been a Crown colony since populated by a handful of families from the Scottish borders There are just seven surnames on the island Glass Green Hagan Lavarello Repetto Rogers and Swain All of them turned up in London years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the Imperial capital In the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital You can build a hospital for under quid Amazing Otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things While theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a South African fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand Xray machine when it sails next week Now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what George W Bush amusingly calls the great state of California Once upon a time California was like they say of Tristan da Cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the North American continent Today with a population the size of Canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of Americas biggest industry entertainment But inside many a studio vicepresident is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out Deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the Tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try And therein lies the contradiction Californias selfinflicted energy crisis has exposed the preposterousness of poseurconservationism in a booming economy Which state has the most rigorous conservation program California Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption California And which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts By now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that conservation is not a viable policy for a nonstagnant economy Instead a rolling blackout here a rolling blackout there and theyre running around like headless chickens Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at everyone in sight Bush and Cheney are irresponsible the power generators are unconscionable no wait theyre snakes and robber barons And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay CEO of Enron Corp I would love said Bill Lockyer Californias AttorneyGeneral to personally escort Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey As the states AttorneyGeneral Mr Lockyer cannot summarily sentence citizens to anal rape but no doubt once the guys convicted he can make some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates Fortunately for Mr Lay as chief exec of the worlds largest energy trader he doesnt live in California he lives in Texas Indeed very few of the folks the State of California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia whose BC Hydro has been living high off the hog on Californias woes could also use a little light buggery but I cant see a Canadian court approving extradition Nevertheless in a state thats overregulated bans new power plants and is addicted to price caps Mr Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to Lalaland California bought into the softeco Sierra Club illusion that somehow one could be a conservationist with no consequences for ones economic wellbeing To put it in terms Californians can understand Suppose you build a house out in the desert But you dont want to buy a car because thats bad for the environment isnt it So instead every morning you call a taxicab in the city to drive out pick you up and take you into the office Not only does it have no environmental benefit but theres no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas Yet thats what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding price caps Through its own incompetence California is wholly dependent on energy generators and distributors from other jurisdictions But it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service California ie Hollywood and Silicon Valley as an act of public welfare A profit is swinelike piggish and totally unreasonable says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange She may have a point but if Californias going to institute price caps they might like to start closer to home After all if Enrons board members dont really need those big salaries do Paramounts or Universals I mean sure Ken Lay has an easy job but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every couple of months I mean surely the guy could do the job on oh a year And thatd be good for conservation cause hed have to give up the Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus And how about Travolta Instead of million per picture maybe he could get by on just two or three and the remaining million could be put into those renewable energy projects hes so keen on I mean a million salary isnt just swinelike its piggish right Since its entry into the Union California has had what we thcentury imperialists call responsible government Tristan da Cunha doesnt Yet its community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than Californias Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him Youre on your own man And if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous they should try spending a week in the dark cut off from the outside world and knowing that even when the radio starts working again its going to take months for the secondhand Xray machine to arrive
