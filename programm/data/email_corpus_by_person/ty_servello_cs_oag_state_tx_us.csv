guilty so since he is a manager at sherlocksfree st round when we decide to visitcheap bastard so am i jodys partner and do we have a th team im not sure whos more patheticme giving up a hawaiian vacation years ago so i could partakeor grant taking time from work and flying in from alaska to be part of the houston ffl gamblers rule now if we could only entice jody to bring aboard his wifeall would be right Smith Jeff Jeff FCCcom AM That idea is the best Ive heard so far And this thing about not voting this year is crap because if enough people have issues about something it should be voted on for this year Its not like it would be a major problem to implement such a system for this year as youve already said well come with two systems on Saturday This is what email is for why cant we have a vote on email between today and tomorrow and have a decision before Saturday Original Message From SMTP Sent Thursday September AM To Smith Jeff Ty AGSTATETXUS Jerry OMPAQcom Subject RE Franchise Players and the Draft suggested draft order scenario franchise teams and nonfranchise franchise teams ranked based on total points of franchise player from previous year First the supplemental draft Round one franchise team supplemental franchise supplemental and so forth and so on with a non snake system going from there ok everyone chew on that and spit back Dutch Original Message From Smith Jeff Jeff FCCcomENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESSmithCJeffCJeffFSmithAFCCEcomE NRONcom Sent Thursday September AM To Kiske Chris Kevin Ty Servello Mike Deluke Michael Currie Jody Spottswood Jeff Ullrich Grant Johnson Quigley Dutch Dan Wienserski Chris Kiske Home BJ Naman Andy Reynolds Subject RE Franchise Players and the Draft The snake thing is good and bad But I think the first round should be randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental and then also at the top of the first round Theoretically the non keeper teams are getting the best players who are arguably also franchise players In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a lower level franchise player So they shouldnt get the an automatic shot at or whatever it might be as well So snake or no snake all of round one should be random order Original Message From Kiske Chris SMTP Sent Wednesday September

Franchise Players and the Draft As the creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to eliminate the inherent advantage that the teams had by getting back to back picks every other round I think the time for mathematical preciseness has passed Im all for going to a simplified traditional snake system Frankly at this point I think there are as many disadvantages to being or or as advantages that it all works itself out Hell if it makes preparing for the draft any easier or administering the league Im for it PS Im for keeping TEs too Somewhere Rick is rolling over in his grave Original Message From Kevin mailto Sent Wednesday September PM To Ty Servello Mike Deluke Michael Currie Jody Spottswood Jeff Ullrich Jeff Smith Email Grant Johnson Dutch Quigley Dan Wienserski

Smith Peyton Manning Michael Deluke Marshall Faulk Michael Currie Edgerrian James Jeff Ullrich Kurt Warner I know this was brought up last year and we kind of decided much of nothingbut does anyone object to going to a snake system for the draft for the whole draft We will still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise players Then the nonfranchise teams will pick in opposite order of the supplemental round for round onethus if you pick first in the supplemental round you will pick last for those that did not keep franchise players in the first round Then the teams that kept franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first round After the first round the draft will snake back the other way with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the draft Let me know what you think or if you are confused See everyone at the draft Kevin
