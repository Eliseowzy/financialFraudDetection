the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important Accordingly I have argued inhouse to anyone who will listen that we should be arguing that WIO should be independent I dont believe that it is independent its a stakeholder board like California and the WSCC both of which we have had problems with Historically a number of people have worked on WIO Tom worked on it for a while Recently I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings I think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some degree Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following seams issues A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance structure I told her that I didnt like the lack of independence and suggested that we oppose it Nonetheless I believe I was told that

Christian CT cc Subject Western Connection Interface WIO Forwarded by Steve C HallPDXECT on AM Steve C Hall PM To Christian CT cc Subject Western Connection Interface WIO Christian Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents proposals and draft bylaws relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization Conclusion Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal bylaws and other materials I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation of the WIO The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric markets in the Western Interconnection However you should carefully consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards transmission owners who will have of the votes Power marketers generators and loadserving entities will only have votes directors establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors present so it is conceivable that for example directors show up of which are transmission owners and the transmission owners are able to pass any resoultion they wish Related to this issue is the inability of one membership group such as the power marketers group to be able to veto a proposal It will take three membership classes acting in unison plus two other votes to defeat a proposed action by the board Unfortunately because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC membership I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk this presents Background and Overview In General The Western Interconnection Organization WIO will be formed by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association the Southwestern Regional Transmission Association the Northwestern Regional Transmission Association and the Western States Coordinating Council WRTA SWRTA NRTA and WSCC respectively into one organization The WIO a nonprofit corporation will assume and perform the functions of these organizations and eventually those organizations will be disbanded The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional reliability operating and procedural standards The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western Interconnection The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices but may work to promote compatible efficient markets Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and between WIO members Membership Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following membership classes may be Member of the WIO There are five classes of membership Business entities owning more than miles of transmission lines Business entities owning less than miles of transmission lines Business entities that do not own control or operate transmission or distribution lines eg power marketers loadserving entities independent power producers End users of electricity and Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western Interconnection Each class elects four directors All of the classes select seven nonaffiliated directors for a total of twentyseven directors Quorum A majority of all members including a majority in at least three classes In the case of directors there must be directors Board Decisions A board decision requires a majority of the directors present Standing Committees There are three standing committees the Planning Coordination Committee the Operating Committee and the Market Interface Committee Committee Voting For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board committees are divided into three classes transmission providers transmission customers and States and Provincial Members which is Class In order to make a recommendation to the board there must be a simple majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer classes Termination The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the members

Marcie Milner Paul CT Steve CT Elizabeth CT Richard CT cc Subject Seams Western Connection Interface WIO Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in the West I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important Accordingly I have argued inhouse to anyone who will listen that we should be arguing that WIO should be independent I dont believe that it is independent its a stakeholder board like California and the WSCC both of which we have had problems with Historically a number of people have worked on WIO Tom worked on it for a while Recently I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings I think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some degree Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following seams issues A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance structure I told her that I didnt like the lack of independence and suggested that we oppose it Nonetheless I believe I was told that we had already agreed to it From Joe NRON on PM CST To Mary CT cc Subject Western Connection Interface WIO Mary Your thoughts Who has historically been in charge of the WIO effort Thanks Joe Forwarded

Christian CT cc Subject Western Connection Interface WIO Forwarded by Steve C HallPDXECT on AM Steve C Hall PM To Christian CT cc Subject Western Connection Interface WIO Christian Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents proposals and draft bylaws relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization Conclusion Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal bylaws and other materials I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation of the WIO The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric markets in the Western Interconnection However you should carefully consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards transmission owners who will have of the votes Power marketers generators and loadserving entities will only have votes directors establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors present so it is conceivable that for example directors show up of which are transmission owners and the transmission owners are able to pass any resoultion they wish Related to this issue is the inability of one membership group such as the power marketers group to be able to veto a proposal It will take three membership classes acting in unison plus two other votes to defeat a proposed action by the board Unfortunately because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC membership I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk this presents Background and Overview In General The Western Interconnection Organization WIO will be formed by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association the Southwestern Regional Transmission Association the Northwestern Regional Transmission Association and the Western States Coordinating Council WRTA SWRTA NRTA and WSCC respectively into one organization The WIO a nonprofit corporation will assume and perform the functions of these organizations and eventually those organizations will be disbanded The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional reliability operating and procedural standards The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western Interconnection The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices but may work to promote compatible efficient markets Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and between WIO members Membership Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following membership classes may be Member of the WIO There are five classes of membership Business entities owning more than miles of transmission lines Business entities owning less than miles of transmission lines Business entities that do not own control or operate transmission or distribution lines eg power marketers loadserving entities independent power producers End users of electricity and Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western Interconnection Each class elects four directors All of the classes select seven nonaffiliated directors for a total of twentyseven directors Quorum A majority of all members including a majority in at least three classes In the case of directors there must be directors Board Decisions A board decision requires a majority of the directors present Standing Committees There are three standing committees the Planning Coordination Committee the Operating Committee and the Market Interface Committee Committee Voting For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board committees are divided into three classes transmission providers transmission customers and States and Provincial Members which is Class In order to make a recommendation to the board there must be a simple majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer classes Termination The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the members
