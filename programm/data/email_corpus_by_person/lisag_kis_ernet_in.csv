<31002763.1075861132376.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lisag@kis.ernet.in,2002-01-09 03:55:29,whats upem very good idea on updating everyone on india i will definitely try to stay on top of that i keep finding myself so busy the school operates on a day class cycle rather than a day cycle so no day of the week is ever the same with regards to the kids or the classes you teach and to make it even more confusing after school activities run on a typical day cycle so intramurals study halls after school meetings etc are on the same day every week so i find myself studying my schedule every night before i go to bed so i know exactly where i am supposed to be the next morning so my responsibilities thus far are assisting during the day with grade boys vball grade vball intramurals after school study hall at the girls dorms times a week and now trying to put together a schedule in which to teach the staff PC applications its amazing how little the teachers know with regards to Microsoft Office especially since the school is trying to get international recognition so Priya and I will be putting classes together so that the teachers get more proficient and then can use computer applications within there curriculum next semester my weekends are pretty busy also saturday i am doing an hour hike to Gunder Falls which is supposed to be absolutely breathtaking I did a hour one last weekend and hopefully will get a chance to get some of those pictures up for everyone to look at then sunday ultimate frisbee next weekend i am chaperoning a camping trip with the th grade students and chaperoning a school dance the days are long and busy but the nights are fairly uneventful we typically do dinner at someones place and then in bed by and up by its fine because the sun rises at and by early afternoon the clouds set in and its overcast the rest of the afternoon and evening i am hoping that soon changes as well as the temperature its absolutely frigid up here probably no colder than it gets in houston in january but theres no escape from it there are no heaters and the houses are made of mud with metal roofing my first purchase here was a tiny space heater well hope all is well i will write more later lisa

<13465031.1075861132677.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lisag@kis.ernet.in,2002-01-22 21:36:29,INDIA UPDATEhello all havent been as good about sending mass email updates as i had originally i ntended so here we go well you have all been asking if i have been sick and i can finally answe r yes it happened this weekend and of all places and times while i was c haperoning a th grade camping trip i am considering myself extremely luc ky though for a couple of reasons my stomach actually held out for w eeks in india it only lasted about hours and started at the latter half of the camping trip and supposedly it should only hit once we wi ll see we all know how much i enjoy being the exception to every rule the camp was at a beautiful spot called Poondi the school owns several hu ndred acres of land surrounding a lake about a hr drive and then a mi nute hike from campus KIS is in the process of building bathrooms and sho wers a sand volleyball court and a deck going out onto the water so it was actually great to be there roughing it with the students before a ll the distractions are in place we spent the days repelling and doing ar chery and i was actually leading some of these activities SCARY so asid e from the rats in the girls hole in the ground bathroom and the extrem ely bumpy bus ride it was rather enjoyable the kids got a kick out of the herd of bison and so did i on the road on our way back to school they were absolutely enormous and the bus driver had to turn off the engine whi le we sat patiently and waited minutes for them to finish doing whateve r it was they were doing so we could proceed on priya and i were scheduled to chaperone a school dance that evening but gi ven my stomach problems i opted out and it ended up being canceled anyway for a memorial service a th grade student who became ill the first day o f class Jan died this weekend he was transported to madurai for care on jan and had been in extremely bad condition ever since indian drs have no idea the cause and had called on other dr around the world to he lp identify the cause but still nothing has been determined the first th ought was that he contracted something at school but that was quickly rule d out given the short time frame he was actually here the students werent allowed to arrive before jan and given his unique case and that no oth er students have had any of symptoms it was ruled an impossibility even m ore tragic the parents of another student had gone to visit Asad in the h ospital shortly after he was admitted and on their way home were involved in a car accident the father died immediately and the mother has been in a coma she is expected to make a full recovery but nonetheless extreme ly traumatic events for young children at the start of the semester lets move on to a brighter topic i am still enjoying myself i started study hall last night i will be doing study hall every tuesday night fro m in the girls th and th grade dorm for math and english its unbeli evable how stupid you can feel trying to do th grade math i was reading the textbook to remind myself what the rules were for arithmetic and geome tric sequences intramurals began this week mondays and thursdays i am do ing th and th grade boys vball intramurals so my evenings are pretty bu sy and my days are getting busier i just took on the kindergarten PE cla ss i start next week there are of them and when i asked what they are doing currently the elementary school coordinator told me that yesterday t hey were marching left right left to learn the difference between their right and left he suggested that next i teach them to skip hop gallop etc how cute is that i am really looking forward to it especially after spending everyday th and th period with the juniors and seniors some m ore good newsI found out monday that all volunteers were given a pay in crease effective immediately for the month of january i was making R smo approx and am now making Rsmo approx priya as sures me that she doesnt spend more than Rsmo so obvioulsy expens ives are of little concern so this is an invitation to all of my fellow e xenron employees still jobhunting with no attachments or responsibilitie s Bryan Niclas to come for an extended visit dont worry its not a one time invitation you will be asked again this weekend i am helping to finalize plans and registration for the Terry Fox K Cancer fundraiser on sunday Terry Fox was a canadian man who los t a leg to cancer and started this fundraiser before he died in the early nineties The fundraiser now takes place in countries and India is the th largest contributing country A canadian woman that i work very closel y with here brought the fundraiser to Kodai last year and it was a huge su ccess before all of that i am chaperoning the middle schools weekend ac tivity saturday night Night Frisbee It should be a pretty tame weekend not that weekends here arent given th e recent events in Calcutta the state of Tamil Nadu and the rest of India have put American Institutions on high alert So this morning at an alls chool assembly the principal met with staff and students to inform us of t he security measures that are in place for the remainder of the week and t hrough the weekend and possibly ongoing All school campus have been shut down and locked up with only the main entrances accessible and guarded by indian commandoes the students all laughed at the word commandoes inst ead of police or armed guards but that was the word used students and staff effective by end of school today are required to wear ID badges no visitors other than family members of student and staff are allowed on ca mpus and students who live in dorms off campus will be transported to and from dorm by bus I LIVE ON CAMPUS I still feel very safe here given th e inaccessibility of Kodaikanal we are extremely far south of everything that continues to happen in the north ft up in the mountains a h r ride up the mountain and remember indians arent the people committing these acts i havent said any of this to worry anyone actually my inten t was quite the opposite i am anticipating emails from a lot of you quest ioning the schools response to the incident in calcutta and wanted to assu re all of you that security measures are in place love you and miss you Lisa I know i forgot many people my distribution lists are set up on my hotmai l account Ashley please forward on to Jahnke Leigh Ann to Tracy and th e rest of the girls
