disclosure of Mondays talk with New York analysts The companys stock reacted with one of the larger losses in a soft electric utility group slipping as low as Thursday morning before steadying to

PGEs K filing noted the utility has authority from the California Public Utility Commission to issue of to billion of shortterm financing Last Friday the filing continued it applied to the commission for the authority to issue an additional billion of shortterm financing It also said the utility is considering the sale of additional longterm debt to finance wholesale power purchase costs and its other capital requirements As noted by several security analysts PGE chief executive Robert Glynn told the New York meeting the utility wants to boost power rates as soon as possible to recover the surging costs the company has been forced to pay to buy electricity in Californias chaotic wholesale power market Other analysts also point out the utility is facing the possibility of significant writeoffs for power costs it will be unable to collect In the K filing PGE said if the utility determines that its uncollected wholesale power purchase costs are not probable of recovery then the utility would be required to write off the unrecoverable portion ABN AMRO utility analysts that attended Mondays meeting said PGE estimates the summer price surge has created an additional billion of stranded cost on top of the existing yet to be recovered stranded cost on its balance sheet of billion The billion total includes unrecovered transition costs of billion which the K said could also reduce future earnings A worst case scenario according to ABN AMRO would be a billion net or per share writeoff of unrecoverable stranded cost if the present high power prices continue to the end

Californias troubled power markets should force tough changes to make deregulation work better not end the movement Speaking at the commissions regular meeting Hoecker and the three other FERC commissioners reiterated their support for deregulation but said the experience in California where prices spiked considerably for residents of San Diego and on wholesale markets must result in new policies I personally reject the notion that this is the beginning of the end for deregulation Hoecker said FERC conducted a hearing in San Diego on Tuesday allowing discussion from utilities

NYSESRE news subsidiary San Diego Gas and Electric became the first in the nation to pay marketbased rates without a safety net Hoecker said now was the time to make tough decisions on retooling deregulation laws to make them work better FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert said the problem is not just in California but also in New York and New England where structural problems with deregulation efforts have triggered market power price supply and reliability concerns Many California and national lawmakers want FERC to declare that rates set by suppliers this summer were not just and reasonable as required under law Such a declaration could be followed by action to impose market restrictions such as price caps across the western US Experts say such a move could lead to the demise

ELECTRICITY PRICES SUPPLY SACRAMENTO Responding to a draft proposal by the Federal Energy Regulator y Commission FERC Governor Gray Davis today announced several initiatives to ensure reliable and affordable electricity in California In a letter to the federal regulators the Governor outlined a variety of regulatory and legislative actions to keep the states electricity price s at the lowest reasonable cost They include innovative measures to encourage the siting of power plants in compliance with the states environmental laws restructuring the states powerbuying agencies to eliminate confl icts of interests and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by larger users during periods of high electricity demand If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope wrote Gov Davis who also reiterated his call to FERC to order retroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers and to impose price caps on the price of wholesale electricity I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that would serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Governor Davis who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of legislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in said that The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Governor added Even though FERC had recently concluded that Californias market was dysfunctional its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop outofstate electrical generators from price gouging and would lead to higher prices next summer The Governors proposals include Introducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO an d PX eliminating members of the board that have what he called inherent conflicts of interest and replacing them with independent members Seeking legislation that will allow new approaches such as emissions credit trading to aid in the siting of new power plants Calling on the states Public Utilities Commission PUC to promote distributed generation and cogeneration Accelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state agencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods Expanding forward contracting by utilities that would allow multiyear contracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability Asking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the states electricity demand reduction programs for commercial users and adopt new programs to allow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity use during peak power periods Reviewing new measures to coordinate powerplant maintenance and operating activities Requiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead of selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive and Calling on the PUC and California Energy Commission CEC to study providin g real time price signals such as metering to large energy users to reduc e energy use Governor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration no power plants were built in the state But since April six power plant s representing MW of new generation have been approved Twenty more applications are under review and more are in the pipeline This represents a significant change in policy and performance and respond s to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection he said The Governors initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FE RC Chairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide inpu t into FERCs final order on the California electricity market That decis ion could come as early as December The Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders consumer groups and other interested parties to discuss additional options He said a more complete plan cannot be developed until FERCs final order has be en announced and analyzed Please see attached letter hoeckerhtml GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of California must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilities generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that would serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that market power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of hig h demand The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are available to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are availabl e to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by the exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigations by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and i n the fashioning of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel the necessary disclosure of information to complete thes e investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferred alternative This suggests that Californias course of generat ion divestiture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation and to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electricity are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means o f coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportunity for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours for more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in other areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged to work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply These programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides million for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I also signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for the next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independent boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method t o do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status quo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in position to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and federal law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS Karen Edson Karen Edson

ELECTRICITY PRICES SUPPLY SACRAMENTO Responding to a draft proposal by the Federal Energy Regulator y Commission FERC Governor Gray Davis today announced several initiatives to ensure reliable and affordable electricity in California In a letter to the federal regulators the Governor outlined a variety of regulatory and legislative actions to keep the states electricity price s at the lowest reasonable cost They include innovative measures to encourage the siting of power plants in compliance with the states environmental laws restructuring the states powerbuying agencies to eliminate confl icts of interests and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by larger users during periods of high electricity demand If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope wrote Gov Davis who also reiterated his call to FERC to order retroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers and to impose price caps on the price of wholesale electricity I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that would serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Governor Davis who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of legislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in said that The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Governor added Even though FERC had recently concluded that Californias market was dysfunctional its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop outofstate electrical generators from price gouging and would lead to higher prices next summer The Governors proposals include Introducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO an d PX eliminating members of the board that have what he called inherent conflicts of interest and replacing them with independent members Seeking legislation that will allow new approaches such as emissions credit trading to aid in the siting of new power plants Calling on the states Public Utilities Commission PUC to promote distributed generation and cogeneration Accelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state agencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods Expanding forward contracting by utilities that would allow multiyear contracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability Asking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the states electricity demand reduction programs for commercial users and adopt new programs to allow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity use during peak power periods Reviewing new measures to coordinate powerplant maintenance and operating activities Requiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead of selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive and Calling on the PUC and California Energy Commission CEC to study providin g real time price signals such as metering to large energy users to reduc e energy use Governor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration no power plants were built in the state But since April six power plant s representing MW of new generation have been approved Twenty more applications are under review and more are in the pipeline This represents a significant change in policy and performance and respond s to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection he said The Governors initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FE RC Chairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide inpu t into FERCs final order on the California electricity market That decis ion could come as early as December The Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders consumer groups and other interested parties to discuss additional options He said a more complete plan cannot be developed until FERCs final order has be en announced and analyzed Please see attached letter hoeckerhtml GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of California must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilities generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that would serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that market power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of hig h demand The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are available to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are availabl e to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by the exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigations by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and i n the fashioning of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel the necessary disclosure of information to complete thes e investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferred alternative This suggests that Californias course of generat ion divestiture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation and to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electricity are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means o f coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportunity for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours for more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in other areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged to work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply These programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides million for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I also signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for the next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independent boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method t o do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status quo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in position to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and federal law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS Karen Edson Karen Edson

PGEs K filing noted the utility has authority from the California Public Utility Commission to issue of to billion of shortterm financing Last Friday the filing continued it applied to the commission for the authority to issue an additional billion of shortterm financing It also said the utility is considering the sale of additional longterm debt to finance wholesale power purchase costs and its other capital requirements As noted by several security analysts PGE chief executive Robert Glynn told the New York meeting the utility wants to boost power rates as soon as possible to recover the surging costs the company has been forced to pay to buy electricity in Californias chaotic wholesale power market Other analysts also point out the utility is facing the possibility of significant writeoffs for power costs it will be unable to collect In the K filing PGE said if the utility determines that its uncollected wholesale power purchase costs are not probable of recovery then the utility would be required to write off the unrecoverable portion ABN AMRO utility analysts that attended Mondays meeting said PGE estimates the summer price surge has created an additional billion of stranded cost on top of the existing yet to be recovered stranded cost on its balance sheet of billion The billion total includes unrecovered transition costs of billion which the K said could also
