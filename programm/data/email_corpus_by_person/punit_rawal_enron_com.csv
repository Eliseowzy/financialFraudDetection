<988981.1075840334517.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,punit.rawal@enron.com,2002-01-07 16:58:59,Cc PST Don I have had a chance to look over the MDEA folder and saw that all the sheets I am responsible for are all there with the exception of the MDEA faxed sheets Now I know these are my sheets because due to a glitch in the page setup the OATI checkouts print the last hour off the page and it is not seen on the sheet I fax across to Entergy Trans Since my fax transmission pages are also present I fail to see how only the MDEA fax sheets can disappear since I hold them together by means of a uclip which was in the folder too I was told today that such means of securing the papers might not be the best and that I should staple them instead As for the Load sheet matrix I have been doing that consistently and never has a problem presented itself before this I can only conclude that it was a software glitch However I wanted to ensure that I wasnt doing anything wrong in terms of procedure I am sorry this brought about so much inconvenience but I can assure you it is not due to a lack in my efforts For the former printing problem I have spoken with the IT Resolution centre and hopefully theyll have an answer for me soon As for the latter I shall simply take a printout of the same henceforth Please feel free to let me know if I need to do something more Regards Punit
