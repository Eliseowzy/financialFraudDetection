Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento CMTA PARTICIPATES IN GOVERNORS ECONOMIC SUMMIT Press Release Today at Governor Davis Economic Summit at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank California the California Manufacturers Technology Association CMTA proposed three recommendations to help bring immediate relief to the states faltering economy California is in a dramatic economic decline said CMTA President Jack M Stewart Manufacturing employment is down this year and by more than jobs in September alone The states unemployment rate has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months peaking at its present percent Its time for the state to implement new policies that will incent investment sooner rather than later said Stewart CMTA today will introduce proposals to Implement a Sales Tax Exemption presssalestax on Manufacturing Processing and Telecommunications Equipment Reduce Electricity Rates presselectricrates and Provide Customer Choice in Energy Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees pressstopfees and Taxes These initiatives will comprise the associations focus in the coming months and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members The costs associated with a battered business community are not only measured by stocktickers and cable financial networks They are the human toll of jobs that are lost mortgages that fail and families that go with less added Stewart These measures will restore confidence in every manufacturers ability to remain productive and allow them to reinvest in the states workforce Californias manufacturing sector currently produces percent of state exports One sixth of state payroll percent higher wages than the statewide average And for every manufacturing job an additional jobs are produced These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help California through this economic crisis concluded Stewart BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS According to just released data from Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Association NVCA venture capital investment in the Bay Area during the rd quarter dropped percent over the nd quarter of this year Investment has slowed significantly this year and the rd quarter investment is percent lower than the billion high reached during the nd quarter of The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for the rd quarter Venture capitalists invested billion nationally during the quarter down percent from the previous quarter and percent from the billion high of last year Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors the venture industry will persevere Veterans in our industry recognize this downturn as part of the longterm venture capital cycle Real value can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas through commented Mark Heesen NVCA President CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association CMTA and other employer organizations Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB by Senator Gloria Romero DLos Angeles The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child parent or spouse in any absence control program Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child parent or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds high temperature sore throats etc that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care However employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions When employees dont show up or show up late for work it negatively impacts production In order to mitigate this problem employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling suspension and termination After the above provision became law employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse SB would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem In addition to insuring that production schedules are met the main reason for an employers absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled andor on time Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning For example if an employees attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes no disciplinary action could be taken In other instances it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late SB would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees CMTA discussed with legislators the counterproductive nature of restricting an employers ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those employees who have trouble getting to work under SB and could end up eliminating the benefit for all employees CMTA applauds Governor Daviss veto of the bill wwwcmtanet California Manufacturers Technology Association th Street Suite Sacramento

Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento CMTA ADVOCATES FOR EQUIPMENT SALES TAX EXEMPTION CMTA President Jack Stewart and member company Baxter Healthcare Corporation will testify on November before the Assembly Committee on Jobs Economic Development and the Economy and explain why an equipment sales tax exemption is needed by manufacturers and how its enactment would stimulate job growth in California Chairwoman Sarah Reyes DFresno conducted a similar hearing last month in Silicon Valley at which this proposal was offered by high tech representatives As a result she invited CMTA to speak on this proposal further and to more fully describe how the sales tax exemption would help get Californias economy back to health CMTA believes that manufacturing and technology strength is essential to a strong California economy Historically our state has been a world leader in these industries which include electronics biotechnology aerospace and the production of goods of every description A strong manufacturing base brings high paying jobs and produces an enormous positive ripple effect in the states economy In order to stay in business manufacturing companies must make enormous investments in capital equipment on a continuing basis California taxes the purchases of manufacturing equipment while states do not Many of the also provide tax credits to entice manufacturing expansion to their states While existing MIC Californias Manufacturers Investment Tax Credit law provides some companies a partial offset against sales tax liability Californias tax burden in this regard is one of the worst four in the country and much heavier than that of any other industrial state Such an exemption would greatly enhance Californias attractiveness as a choice for building a new facility or expanding an existing site It would bring a direct and immediate incentive for expansion to all companies in all parts of the state in the manufacturing sector CMTA will also give testimony on its proposed moratorium on regulatory fees and its measure to reduce electricity rates and provide customer choice in energy ENERGY POLICIES REVISITED As the energy crisis wanes many of the actions taken in the last year are being revisited Heres a sampling of what was done why policymakers are taking a secondlook and what may result In January ABX Keeley DBoulder Creek directed DWR to purchase electricity and DWR signed long term contracts at the height of the crisis High fixed prices and reliance on natural gasfired generation have caused consumers environmentalists and the CPUC to demand renegotiation Contract modification could lower prices and make more room for direct access contracts between customers and suppliers ABX also prescribed a financing mechanism that upon secondlook the legislature wants modified by SBX Burton DSan Francisco which uncouples payment for DWR contracts from payment of bonds Citing a preference for SBX and renegotiation of DWR contracts the CPUC refused to approve a rate agreement so that bonds can be issued The Governor promises to veto SBX but has started reviewing DWR contracts The Power Authority was created to ensure a reserve margin in electricity supplies This spring it issued an RFP for supply but was informed recently by DWR that no additional long term supply is required Assemblyman Keeley will hold a hearing this month to review the mission and activities of the Power Authority Last year the legislature passed a bill requiring all generators sited under expedited month licensing to switch from simple cycle to cleaner combinedcycle within years On November th under the Governors emergency powers the CEC removed this requirement allowing the Power Authority to fulfill its margin with dirtier plants for an indefinite term Environmentalists claim that this means dirtier plants for years As the energy crisis became headline news the ISO member stakeholder board came under attack as an ineffective generatordriven body Replaced this year with a member board appointed by the Governor the new ISO and DWR are now under attack for sharing information and manipulating the wholesale market in violation of federal law In June the CPUC ordered the largest rate increase in history Since wholesale prices declined this summer PGE and SCE are collecting more revenues than needed to cover current utility and DWR costs If this trend continues rates may be adjusted downward or revenues may be allocated to historical costs such as utility and DWR back debt In September both PGE and SCE submitted plans for payment of back debt PGE is waiting for bankruptcy court approval of the asset transfer to its holding company and SCE is fighting for its rate freeze deal on appeal from federal district court Legislators may review the plans upon their return in January A LOOK BACK AT THE INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM It was almost a year ago that blackouts plagued California and businesses that operated under interruptible contracts felt the squeeze of repeated curtailments Dire predictions that the Summer of would be fraught with blackouts never came to pass and a year later the State continues to evaluate its energy infrastructure supply and demand Still at issue is whether or not those businesses that did not optout of interruptible programs will be required to repay the fines and penalties that accrued between October and January Numerous requests to curtail the threat of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and penalties and suspension of the optout window in November led to demands by the business community for the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act to remedy the situation As a result in January the CPUC suspended fines and penalties for failure to curtail under interruptible contracts and the programs temporarily were placed on hold In April the CPUC issued Rulemaking which among other things allowed businesses to optout or readjust their firm service level effective November if they repaid the discounts received from November through April These customers were not required to pay fines or penalties that accrued between those dates however they were prohibited from participating in any load reduction program that pays per kW for the remainder of Customers also were allowed to optout or to adjust their firm service level effective the beginning of the first billing period after approval of this rulemaking and upon notification by the utility These customers were allowed to retain the rate discount for interruptible service through the date of any change in schedule or firm service level but were required to pay any fines or penalties assessed for failure to interrupt during the period that fines and penalties were not suspended The CPUC has wrestled with how to address the substantial fines and penalties assessed on businesses and yet still preserve the program such that businesses would comply when called upon in the future No CPUC solution would have made whole all businesses that participated in the program and as expected the CPUC decision affected each business differently It is rumored that the CPUC will revisit the fines and penalties provisions to see how businesses that substantially curtailed but were required to repay the full discount were impacted however a specific hearing date has not yet been set Stay tuned for further developments SLOWING ECONOMY HAMMERS BAY AREA WORKERS Technology Sector Drives Job Losses According to a just released report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco the economic downturn has resulted in lost Bay Area jobs in just the last five months The breadth of the slowdown in the information technology IT sector has seriously begun to drag down employment in other sectors The Bay Area relies on hightech for percent of its wages and percent of its jobs Business investment in IT products and software has slowed substantially this year dampened by uncertainty in the national economy dotcom and telecommunications crash and over investment by business in IT products The abrupt slowdown in business investment in IT has had a noticeable impact on orders shipments and production among technology firms resulting in declines in output and employment in these sectors according to the report Softening markets for new office and industrial space have also dampened growth in construction employment this year Employment among providers of shipping trucking and warehousing services also fell in recent months as firms scaled back in response to slowing demand BILL PROHIBITING ENGLISHONLY RULE MAY HINDER WORKPLACE SAFETY The California Manufacturers Technology Association CMTA opposed AB a bill authored by Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City and signed by Governor Davis The bill makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to limit or prohibit the use of nonEnglish language in the workplace unless justified by an overriding business necessity The Fair Employment and Housing Act already prohibits an Englishonly rule with one exception An employer can require that employees speak only in English at certain times if the employer can show that the rule is justified by business necessity and has effectively notified its employees of the circumstances and the time when speaking only in English is required and the employees have been made aware of the consequences of violating the rule AB not only provides the same protections it goes into greater detail that is difficult for an employer to follow and it creates a trap for the unwary employer An employer may be sued if any step outlined in the bill is not followed exactly and could face both compensatory and punitive damages plus a per worker statutory damage award No empirical evidence was presented indicating that current law was ineffective or that multiple monetary penalties were needed to deter employers from violating this provision of the law The bill may prove harmful to employees if it turns out that injuries or fatalities in the workplace begin occurring because safety and health rules are not being clearly communicated and understood by all employees and reinforced in a common language CMTA is also concerned that the bill may encourage more discrimination and harassment complaints by employees who believe they are the subjects of nonEnglish conversations that could severely undermine employee moral AB becomes law on January Employers who have Englishonly rules should review their rules to make sure that they are not in conflict with the bill wwwcmtanet California Manufacturers Technology Association th Street

Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento IWC RULES IN EMPLOYERS FAVOR ON EMPLOYEES PAY STATUS DURING TEMPORARY PLANT SHUTDOWN At the October th hearing in San Jose the Industrial Welfare Commission IWC approved an amendment of the Statement as to the Basis of Wage Order rejecting the controversial letter written by Mr Miles Locker former Chief Counsel Division of Labor Standards Enforcement DLSE that prohibited any deductions from exempt employees salary in increments of less than onemonth during temporary plant shut down The amendment makes it clear that the IWC believes that employers are required to pay exempt employees their full predetermined salary for any week in which any work is performed instead of any month in which any work is performed with limited exceptions Thats good news for employers CMTA along with other employer representatives testified at the commission hearing requesting that the IWC clarify whether California businesses should continue to follow the federal rules regarding exempt employees salary deductions Under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA the salary deduction for exempt employees is measured in weeks and not months as opined by Mr Locker under California law Lockers much maligned interpretation was believed to be based on AB Chapter Statutes of a bill that made sweeping changes to California wage and hour laws However AB did not contain any language that specifically prohibited wage deductions from exempt employees in increments of less than one month On the contrary Section c of the Labor Code specifically provides that for purposes of this section fulltime employment means employment in which an employee is employed for hours per week In CMTAs opinion this language clearly provides that salaries may be paid weekly clearly comporting with the FLSA that permits weekly deduction Advocacy on this issue is not yet over While the amendment clearly indicates where the commission stands on the issue according to Commission Chair Bill Dombrowski amendment passed on a vote it only applies to Wage Order Public Housekeeping and not to the other orders The IWC is authorized to amend without hearings the Statement as to the Basis of any wage order that is open Wage Order was the only order open at the October meeting so the commission did not have the authority to clarify the issue by revising all of the wage orders Also important to employers is that the IWC voted to set an investigation hearing with regard to the issues set forth in the Locker letter and requested that the commission staff establish a schedule for completing that investigation and amending all of the wage orders to reflect the commissions position on this issue in as short a time as possible The commissions action is good news for California employers especially when they are about to enter the most frequent periods of temporary shut downs the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas Employers are facing many economic challenges in a slowing economy and flexibility is needed to improve efficiencies and control cost if employers are to remain competitive and minimize layoffs Employers are already faced with highenergy costs and doubledigit cost increases in health care and workers compensation insurance premiums that only seem to grow CMTA believes that the commissions ruling brings clarity and reason to the issue indicating that temporary plant closures in California will continue to follow the federal rules concerning exempt employees salary deductions DTSC STEPS UP PRESSURE ON MERCURY The California Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC recently released a comprehensive report on mercury a metal that is ubiquitous in the environment and can be found in manufacturing processes and consumer products Examples cited in the report include ash contaminated soil cement manufacturing sewage sludge pharmaceuticals paint pesticides electrical switches fluorescent lamps and batteries Mercury is the subject of increasing regulatory attention due to the fact that certain forms are highly toxic and known to bioaccumulate ie concentrate in organisms DTSCs report examines mercury uses health effects behavior in the environment and regulatory options The report recommends regulating all mercurycontaining waste whether present in manufacturing process wastes consumer products or naturally occurring mercury liberated in mining or construction activities as hazardous waste This broadbrush listing approach would be a dramatic departure from the current concentrationbased regulatory scheme and raises numerous policy questions concerning the extent of DTSCs regulatory authority the point at which a material or product is determined to be a waste collection and handling requirements and class hazardous waste disposal capacity This approach also calls into question the future viability of existing recycling programs where postconsumer recyclable materials may contain trace quantities of mercury Presumably consumers haulers and recyclers would find themselves in the business of managing hazardous waste In advancing this recommendation the report fails to assess the anticipated environmental and human health benefit and the associated cost to consumers and the regulated community Moreover it fails to address at least one major source of mercury exposure legacy waste from past placer mining activities While DTSC acknowledges that legacy mining waste is one of the largest contributors of mercury to the states environment the report does not contemplate strategies to mitigate this source These issues should be addressed in a subsequent iteration of the report before DTSC initiates any regulatory action Now more than ever the state must ensure that its regulatory initiatives make wise use of limited resources to target the sources that drive public health risks and environmental exposures MORE BAD NEWS FROM FINANCE MANUFACTURING JOB LOSSES GROW According to justreleased figures from the California Department of Finance a clearer picture of the California economy is emerging subsequent to September It appears California suffered less than the nation as a whole with the states drop in nonfarm jobs amounting to only percent of the nationwide loss of jobs The Manufacturing sector continued to take the brunt in California losing over jobs in October now totaling over lost jobs during the last months Industry employment estimates for October show a decline in all private industry sectors with the exception of a small gain in finance insurance and real estate The state appears however to be faring better than the nation as a whole The impact of the September attacks is difficult to gauge Air transportation lost jobs which is about of the national losses Hotels shed jobs which represent about of the national loss Eating and drinking places actually added jobs even though the nation as a whole dropped Transportation services which include travel agents lost jobs in California compared to nationally Manufacturing employment dropped in October with weakness in both hightech industriescomputers electronics aerospace and instrumentsand in constructionrelated fields Chemicals posted the only gain in October Nationally manufacturing dropped jobs Local government employment rose during the month after dropping more than in September reflecting difficulties in seasonally adjusting beginning of school year figures On a yearoveryear basis total industry employment grew by or percent while the nation lost jobs a drop of percent Wholesale and retail trade added the most jobs Services were not far behind adding jobs Manufacturing employment has fallen by jobs over the year with over half of the losses coming from the states high tech sectors The motion picture industry lost jobs in the aftermath of heavy strikehedge activity in the first half of the year Californias unemployment rate rose percent to percent in October with the unemployment rolls growing by Nationally the jobless rate jumped percent to percent Revenue Update Preliminary General Fund Agency Cash for October was below the Budget Act Forecast of billion Yeartodate revenues are million below expectations These revenue figures reflect activity subsequent to September with the exception of that rd quarter sales tax data are not yet finalized Yeartodate bank and corporation taxes are down million from forecast and personal income taxes are million under forecast REPORTS ON NATURAL GAS Rumblings of a looming natural gas problem are surfacing however there is little expectation that this problem will expand into a crisis of electricity proportions Legislation was passed in requiring the California Public Utilities Commission to look at and report longterm natural gas forecasts Preliminary studies have been completed and likely will be released in the next week or so

early November with business and labor leaders and professional economists to identify and discuss measures to stimulate Californias economy The date and participants will be announced this week Governor Davis is also considering the possibility of calling a Special Legislative Session to enact such measures immediately In an effort to avoid or minimize a looming State budget deficit the Department of Finance has instructed state agencies to cut their budgets by CMTAs members are devising a priority list of policies that should be adopted to help mitigate the effects of the international economic cooling and hopefully staveoff recession in this state POWER AUTHORITY MEETING Renewables and the Power Authority At an October Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority Power Authority meeting in San Francisco Chairman David Freeman acknowledged that renewable peaking capacity may comprise a significant portion of the percent reserve the Authority expects to establish to prevent future price spikes in the cost of electricity Freeman indicated that the Authority has received proposals for MW in peaker capacity which have been evaluated and winnowed down to MW While commitments to build these peaker facilities have not yet been formalized the Power Authority is moving forward with proposals for a few hundred renewable megawatts Freeman also indicated that at least two state biomass plants are at risk of shutting down He believes that these plants should continue to run despite the high costs associated with this market Power Authority staff has been asked to look at options to keep the plants operating and to report back to the Power Authority Board member Donald Vial expressed concern at the way in which the Power Authority is looking at the percent reserve He believes that the reserve should be a working capacity margin used to phase out dirty plants and to move into and to promote renewables Board member John Stevens pointed out that the Power Authority has limited funding with which to purchase peaking capacity and reminded the members that any plan must reasonably balance the costs associated with the generation capacity Department of Water Resources Update The Power Authority also received a report from staff of the Department of Water Resources DWR who indicated that the Department is looking at load curtailment renewables and new supplies that ideally are north of Path The Department believes it has been instrumental in keeping the spot market under control and minimizing the number of blackouts experienced this summer The Department also gave a great deal of credit to customers who have been instrumental in preventing blackouts through conservation The Department will be updating its energy portfolio needs and posting its information on its website at wwwcerswatercagov sometime next week Public Utilities Commission Natural Gas Infrastructure Report Barbara Hale the Director of Strategic Planning at the Public Utilities Commission PUC provided an update on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report that is due to the Power Authority by November Ms Hale indicated that the PUC is working with the California Energy Commission CEC to evaluate the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure including interstate pipelines intrastate pipelines local distribution storage and backbone The PUC fully expects to have the report finalized and ready to deliver to the Power Authority by November Preliminary findings indicate that inground storage is at percent of capacity a healthy margin to meet demands through the winter While there still is room to inject additional natural gas the PUC is expecting a moderate winter with low gas demand Chairman Freeman requested that the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report also include a forecast of natural gas availability from the lower states and Canada as well as whether or not California may depend on these sources to meet its needs Board Member Vial questioned if the unbundling of storage has been successful Ms Hale replied that the PUC is monitoring noncore use and that preliminary findings indicate that many noncore customers are increasing their use of storage Activities Related to Renewable Energy and Conservation Staff at the Power Authority reported that coordination between the PUC and the Power Authority is necessary to optimize conservation energy efficiency and demand response Specifically the Power Authority is putting together a residential loan program financing for efficiencies in public buildings and financing for small commercial and industrial upgrades The Power Authority believes that the small commercial and industrial market is the most underserved due to the multiple demands on owners and their lack of resources The Power Authority is looking at ways to assist these customers in retrofitting their facilities At the other end of the spectrum the Power Authority believes that large commercial and industrial customers require the least assistance The Power Authority believes these customers are well served under current programs but acknowledged that many of the demand response programs would be better coordinated under the administration of just one agency Finally Board Member Vial questioned why there has been little emphasis on real time pricing Power Authority staff agreed that real time pricing has not been a priority and that the infrastructure to implement a real time pricing program does not currently exist Staff did indicate however that a recent million investment in meters should help to incentivize these programs Freeman concluded that it is important for the Power Authority to build on the momentum of conservation and he acknowledged that technology finally is being priced such that real time pricing makes sense and likely will be an integral part of the Power Authoritys program Laura Doll Named as New Executive Director Laura Doll of Austin Texas was approved as the Chief Executive Officer of the Power Authority at the October Board meeting Most recently Doll was Director of Customer Service for Grande Communications She also has held the positions of Senior Vice President for Planergy as well as Chief Administrative Officer for Austin Energy Doll received a master of public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin and a bachelor of arts degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute She will receive an annual salary of COMPUTER RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY BILL VETOED AGAIN Governor Davis vetoed SB by Senator Debra Bowen DMarina Del Rey on October The bill would have required employers to prepare and distribute by hard copy or electronically a company monitoring policies and practices notice to each employee to collect and verify their understanding of the notice and file and maintain each employees signed notice indefinitely This is the third time Senator Bowens notice bill has been vetoed by the Governor and we hope that the bill has struck out In his veto message the governor referred to some of the concerns expressed by employers such as the need to monitor and control the use of company property for business purposes Also employers are potentially liable for the misuse of computers for improper purposes such as sexual harassment defamation and the like so employers have a legitimate reason to monitor email and computer files from time to time The Governor said in closing his veto message I support reasonable privacy protections for employees in the workplace and my Administration proposed amendments which would carry out the intent of the bill without imposing undue regulatory burdens and potential legal exposure to businesses for doing what any employee should assume is the employers right when they accept employment Senator Bowen rejected the proposed amendments Thus I must veto the bill a third time This is a significant victory for employers The bill had the potential to open up Pandoras box on employee notices in the workplace by greatly expanding the scope confirmation and tracking of notices CMTA applauds the Governors veto of SB GOVERNOR SIGNS MERCURY LEGISLATION Governor Davis has signed legislation to place new controls on products containing mercury SB by Senator Byron Sher DPalo Alto places new controls on the disposal of appliance and vehicle components found to contain mercury I am signing this bill because it will help reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded thermometers novelty products and by mercurycontaining electrical switches that are not removed before junked vehicles are crushed or shredded said Davis SB also bans the sale of new automobiles in California after January that contain mercury electrical switches

Legislative Weekly October Issue Volume A weekly publication from the California Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ECONOMY CONTINUES SLIDE Manufacturing Jobs Lost in September The California Department of Finance reports in their October bulletin that the employment and revenue picture in the state is not positive The most available economic data on the state do not yet reflect the economic impacts or conditions after the September attacks The Department indicated in their October bulletin that although too little time has elapsed to accurately appraise the attacks impact on the state it is reasonable to assume that the full impacts of the September attacks will be quite serious add to existing economic woes and are now only beginning to emerge Labor market figures in the bulletin for September reflect employment status at anytime during the second week of the month including September the day preceding the attacks Nonfarm employment based on a survey of establishments declined in September Industry estimates for September indicate a decline in construction employment weakness in nearly all manufacturing sectors gains in private service employment and an anomalous drop in government employment Manufacturing employment dropped by jobs in September Californias hightech specialtiescomputers electronics aerospace and instrumentsaccounted for over percent of the losses Only textile mill employment rose in September Service sector employment rose by in September based on gains in motion pictures jobs social services jobs and engineering and management consulting jobs These gains offset the fifth consecutive monthly decline in business service employment which lost jobs On a yearoveryear basis services added the most jobs followed closely by government and more distantly by wholesale and retail trade Manufacturing lost jobs over the year with losses in nearly all sectors High tech manufacturing has been hard hit Californias unemployment rate based on a survey of households inched up percent to percent in September based on a rise by in the number unemployed A year ago the unemployment rate was percent The national unemployment rate at percent is up a full percentage point over the year Preliminary General Fund agency cash for September was million below the Budget Act forecast of billion At this time it does not appear that any significant amount of this months shortfall was attributable to the September terrorist attacks If a reduction in taxable sales occurred as a result of those attacks it will be reflected in the sales tax receipts due at the end of October Any other effects on revenues due to such things as the fall in the stock market or employment losses may not be apparent for some time Yeartodate revenues are million below expectations CPUC EXPLORES ISSUES SURROUNDING DIRECT ACCESS On September the CPUC suspended the right to enter into new contracts for direct access The CPUC left for later consideration what effect should be given to contracts executed before September including renewals of such contracts Previously the CPUC indicated that it might suspend direct access effective July On October Commissioner Wood issued a ruling asking for public input on direct access contracts noting that commencing on or about July there has been an increase in customers switching to direct access He states that there are serious policy concerns about costshifting If customers are allowed to switch to direct access there is a potential for these exiting customers to avoid helping to pay down the unprecedented debt incurred by the State to help weather the energy crisis These costshifting issues are part of the Commissions consideration in determining whether there should be an earlier suspension date and what this date should be Some of the questions he asks include Why should or shouldnt the Commission choose an earlier date than after September for suspending the right to acquire direct access service If the Commission should choose an earlier date why should or shouldnt the Commission consider a July suspension If not July what other date or dates should the Commission consider and why Are there alternatives to suspending direct access as of a date before September that would still alleviate costshifting problems What effect if any should be given to renewals of contracts originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commissions suspension of direct access What effect if any should be given to provisions in contracts addon provisions that allow the buyer to add more facilities to be served after the date on which direct access is suspended For electric service providers How many contracts have you entered into with direct access customers between January and September What percentage of your total direct access contracts contains any renewal provision What percentage of your total direct access contracts contains any addon provision Also requested are copies of unsigned contract forms and signed contracts with names and other sensitive information deleted but contract signing dates retained CMTA will be submitting written comments which are due November EMPLOYERS IN A QUANDARY ON TEMPORARY PLANT SHUTDOWN STATUS The California Manufacturers Technology Association CMTA is continuing to seek clarification from the Industrial Welfare Commission IWC in regards to the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement DLSE Opinion Letter of May Re Deductions From Exempt Employees Salary This very controversial letter written by Mr Miles Locker Chief Counsel DLSE generated an enormous number of complaints from employers Labor Commissioner Arthur Lujan suspended the letter on June and requested clarification from the Industrial Welfare Commission IWC of the criteria for determining the correct interpretation of salary However the letter left reduction from exempt employees salary and other issues raised in the letter unresolved and still hanging over the heads of employers when they are about to enter the most frequent periods of use Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks CMTA believes that the salary basis test applicable to all wage orders should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the salary basis test in the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA that California has consistently followed over the years Under the FLSA the salary deduction for exempt employees is measured by weeks and not months as opined by Mr Locker under California law The opinion letter prohibited any deductions from exempt employees salary in increments of less than one month based on the quantity of work quality of work and or business operating requirements Therefore in order to be eligible for the overtime exemption the employee must receive his or her full salary for any month in which he or she performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked This is a particularly onerous provision for manufacturers who have a long history of temporarily shutting plants down for a week over such holidays as Thanksgiving Christmas and New Years Day During temporary plant shut downs employees are permitted to use accrued vacation or other paid time off to meet the salary requirement for days missed Employers are facing many economic challenges in our slowing economy and flexibility is needed to improve efficiencies and control cost if employers are to remain competitive and minimize layoffs Employers are already faced with high energy costs and double digit cost increases in health and workers compensation insurance premiums that only seem to grow That is why the commission needs to take action now to clearly and specifically state that Californias policy on exempt worker salary deductions was is and continues to follow the FLSA on exempt worker salary reductions WASTE BOARD DELAYS ADOPTION OF CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGIC PLAN In response to concerns raised by the business community the California Integrated Waste Management Board agreed earlier this week to delay adoption of a controversial draft Strategic Plan The Plan is intended to serve as the Boards blueprint for resource allocation and policymaking over the next years Business concerns revolve around the process by which the document was developed and concepts that promote new taxes on products and packaging See last weeks article for more information The Board will entertain further discussion on the draft Plan at a November workshop The Boards action should allow CMTA and other stakeholders to engage Board members and staff in a meaningful dialogue before the Plan is adopted CMTA REQUESTS JUDICIAL CLARIFICATION OF RULE GOVERNING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISCLOSURE DURING LITIGATION Acting as amicus curiae CMTA has urged a California Court of Appeal to provide guidance to the business public regarding the extent and conditions under which trade secret information must be revealed in the pretrial discovery process in trade secret misappropriation cases The California statute which governs such discovery exchanges states that a party claiming to have been injured from trade secret misappropriation may obtain another partys trade secret records only if it identifies the relevant trade secrets with reasonable particularity The purpose behind the statute clearly is to protect responding parties from fishing expeditions being launched outside the scope of the dispute which is the subject of the lawsuit A trade secret can be the most valuable asset of a business Moreover it is extremely vulnerable to destruction during litigation as its disclosure can destroy its secret quality and hence its value Finally and most importantly as parties to trade secret litigation are usually competitors revelation of trade secret information by one to the other tends to have direct and harmful consequences Thus the California legislature passed the statute to help protect against unreasonable discovery practices which would tend to affect adversely such material Unfortunately the statute provides no guidance as to the manner in which the parties must comply Ambiguity in this area causes uncertainty and expense to business wwwcmtanet California Manufacturers Technology

Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento PLENTY OF ENERGY BUT LITTLE TRUST As state and federal officials try to rebuild the defunct California energy market the lack of supply has been replaced by a lack of trust as an ingredient in the ongoing crisis For example Instate generators dont trust the ISO Theyve alleged that the ISO whose board is now all Governor Davis appointees is buying power from DWR or the Pacific Northwest rather than the cheapest bid from generators in violation of federal law CalISO noted that DWRs socalled out of market purchases were more expensive than the bids to the ISO January through August Now the price is roughly the same Consumer groups dont trust the DWR They suggest that the DWR is manipulating the CalISO market for lastminute electricity to help hide surplus electricity that DWR agreed to buy under billion worth of longterm power contracts signed last spring DWR denies this Western states dont trust California As FERC attempts to drum up support for a westwide regional transmission system RTO they heard from other states loud and clear Please dont screw it up Were all saying we dont want to be with California Dont lump us all together This has led FERC Commissioners to conclude that three subregional organizations one being CalISO could form under an umbrella organization rather than a single entity Consumer groups dont trust the CPUC The stealth deal struck by the CPUC to bailout Southern California Edison caused The Utility Reform Network to ask the federal court to undo the deal CMTA was denied intervention Legislators dont trust FERC The bankruptcy reorganization plan for PGE sends generation assets to the holding company and FERC has jurisdiction over the power sale contract back to the regulated utility Many legislators blame FERC for the market meltdown last year and object to any more FERC control over California markets Consumers dont trust the California Power Authority and DWR The California Power Authority was created to ensure a reserve margin in electricity supplies as insurance against blackouts and price spikes DWR entered into billion in long term contracts and is one of the largest single buyers of electricity in the entire West The combination of current longterm DWR contracts and the possibility of more investment in supply by the CPA has consumer groups worrying that lower prices are only a distant and faint hope CPUCS ENERGY EFFICIENCY FUNDING The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC issued a draft decision this week on future energy efficiency policies in an effort to open energy efficiency funding to nonutility entities and to create competition with investorowned utility programs Specifically the decision opens public goods charge energy efficiency funding to nonutility entities such as local governments chambers of commerce and others interested in participating in the program The CPUC believes that this competition will spur overall program delivery improvement and encourage program continuity by creating multiyear funding opportunities The policy manual to be adopted defines CPUC policy rules in great detail and is intended to assist interested parties in preparing proposals in a standard format to minimize apples and oranges comparisons million will be provided to fund statewide programs million in grants will be made available to fund innovative local and regional programs and million will be allocated to the CPUC to assess the States energy efficiency needs Following in order of importance are the goals and objectives of the CPUCs energy efficiency programs The point value under each objective represents their maximum possible score for each objective A perfect score would be points LongTerm Annual Gas and Electric Savings Points The purpose of this category is to create permanent and verifiable energy savings over the lifecycle of energy efficiency measures affected by the program In this area the CPUC is striving for sustainability in the consumption behaviors and investment choices its programs are designed to stimulate Addressing Market Failures or Barriers Points The proposal must include a description of the type of barrier it is designed to overcome For example lack of consumer information about energy efficiency benefits higher startup expense for highefficiency measures relative to standardefficiency measures lack of availability of highefficiency products Equity Considerations Points The CPUC will generally prioritize programs that provide access to energy efficiency alternatives for underserved or hardtoreach markets Cost Effectiveness Points All proposals will be required to provide an estimate of the lifecycle benefits and costs Electric Peak Demand Savings Points Programs paid for by electric public goods charge funds should emphasize longterm and permanent peak demand savings Innovation Points The CPUC will prioritize programs that present new ideas new delivery mechanisms new providers of energy efficiency services or new and emerging technologies Synergies and Coordination with Programs Run by Other Entities Points To minimize confusion and overlap for consumers the CPUC desires program proposals that take advantage of synergies or coordination with other existing programs including those run by other state agencies private entities municipal utilities or the federal government The program allows nonutility parties to submit proposals directly to the Commission for consideration rather than to the utilities as has been required in the past Existing programs will be continued in the First Quarter of for a smooth transition and most new programs will run through For more information see the CPUCs website email them at or call the energy efficiency hotline at The CPUC plans to hold a public workshop to assist parties in preparing proposals once the decision is finalized EMPLOYERS MAY FACE RETROACTIVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PAYMENTS Following newspaper articles criticizing Governor Davis and the Employment Development Department EDD for making misleading remarks regarding SB s Alarcon DSylmar increase in unemployment benefits payments for laid off workers one legislator has already initiated the process to remedy the situation at employers expense Assemblyman Lou Papan DMillbrae introduced a preprint of AB that would retroactively increase UI benefits payments from to for workers laid off on or after July This year the Governor signed SB a bill that raises the maximum weekly payment from to for claims filed on and after January The squabble is about remarks made by the Governor during the bills signing in Los Angeles where many airline workers had been laid off The Governor said I want to make sure we have unemployment benefits that allow these workers to survive until the economy recovers and this will significantly strengthen the safety net not only for airline employees but hightech workers and all those who have been temporarily laid off as a result of a softening economy Apparently many workers believed that they would be receiving the increase benefit payment now and were surprised when EDD later informed them that the benefit increase would only apply to claims filed after December CMTA has already expressed serious concern about the high cost of SB to employers billion and its potential to bankrupt the UI fund However if the Legislature passes a bill making benefits retroactive to July and the unemployment rate continues to grow at the current pace the fund will become insolvent even sooner than our earlier prediction While no one knows what the cost of six months of retroactive UI benefits payment would be to employers at this time we know that it would be rather substantial The state jobless rates rose from percent in September to percent in October and there are no signs indicating that the downturn in the economy is slowing As many businesses struggle to survive in these economically hard times it seems inappropriate for government to be contemplating adding more cost on businesses CARB RELEASES DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GUIDELINES Earlier this week the California Air Resources Board ARB issued for public review the latest iteration of its environmental justice guidance document entitled Proposed Policies and Actions for Environmental Justice This effort has been a source of concern for CMTA and others in the business community given CARBs decision to depart from the statutory framework established by SB Solis and SB Escutia In addition while the current version is much improved over earlier versions there are two remaining significant issues First Californias air quality programs are based on attaining criteria pollutant standards eg ozone particulate matter nitrogen oxides and reducing risks posed by toxic air contaminants ARBs proposed policy would change that fundamental framework by focusing on cumulative emissions This shift in focus disregards the relevance of exposure and risk in determining the existence and extent of a problem and could lead to random rather than sciencebased regulatory actions Second consistent with State environmental justice statutes California should address environmental justice on a programmatic basis as opposed to a permitbypermit basis However references in the document to permitting and mitigation appear to be at odds with that approach These concerns have been brought to ARBs attention by several business organizations along with specific suggestions for alternative language to make the document consistent with Californias existing air quality framework The Board will consider adoption of the document during its December hearing WASTE BOARD ADOPTS STRATEGIC PLAN On Tuesday November th the California Integrated Waste Management Board CIWMB adopted its Strategic Plan on a vote incorporating changes drafted by staff that address some of the concerns raised by manufacturers and other business representatives Among the noteworthy changes new language was added to define the concept of zero waste as striving towards maximum waste reduction through the most efficient use of natural resources and maximizing recycling Other language changes addressing the concepts of product stewardship sustainability and manufacturer responsibility help to address CMTA concerns about the potential use of this document as a rationale for new government mandates such as minimum content recycling rates and taxes on specific products The full text of the adopted Plan is available at agendasmtgdocsdoc HEARING ON POST ATTACK STATE OF THE ECONOMY The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committees November informational hearing on The Response to Recent Terrorist Attacks elicited testimony from the Legislative Analyst the California Budget Project and various travel related industries regarding the post attack state of the economy and appropriate legislative responses Testimony was also requested as to what tax relief might be appropriate for victims families According to the Legislative Analysts Office LAO California is in a mild recession which will give way to moderate recovery in the Spring On the other hand LAO conceded huge uncertainty as to when consumer confidence would return or the stock market decline would play out Witnesses from the California Budget Project stated that tax relief was not the best way to boost the states economy the basis for their opinion was that taxes account for a small percentage of the cost of doing business and that the state budget accounts for a small share of the states economy They also claimed that California is not at a competitive disadvantage Testimony was given by business interests regarding the types of relief that would be appropriate now and marginal cost reduction for a business can make the difference between bankruptcy and survival CMTA presented testimony during the public comment period about the virtue of a sales tax exemption upon manufacturing equipment how California disadvantages itself by imposing such a tax and how capital investments by manufacturers are essential to their continued role as job providers in California GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL SESSION IN JANUARY ON BUDGET CUTS Following meetings with Legislative leadership this week Governor Davis ordered state government to cut more than billion in spending contained in the current state budget The Governor plans to call a Special Session to run concurrently with the Legislatures regular session in January to act on the proposed reductions With California reeling from its worst economic slump in a decade scores of programs will be slashed diverted and delayed Education is set to take the biggest hit with more than million in programs that have been the centerpiece of the Davis administration The expansion of the Healthy Families program will be delayed until July Other cuts include million for grants to encourage housing close to the workplace million for affordable multifamily housing million for local parks projects million in utility bill subsidies for lowincome consumers and million for energy bill assistance for needy households A state government hiring freeze was already ordered by Davis last week For more details
