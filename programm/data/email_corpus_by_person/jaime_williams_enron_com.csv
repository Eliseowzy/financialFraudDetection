<27604967.1075840865064.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jaime.williams@enron.com,2001-08-22 10:50:47,Re Approvals on Monterrey expenditures Cc Dear Georgeanne I am surprised and you can be sure that I try very hard to adhere to Enron Corporate Treasury Policies which I havent actually seen so far As a matter of fact Max Yzaguirre used to sign Alatorres expenses and I was specifically told to do so until further notice Now let me tell you this is the wrong way of giving me notice By the way Aprils expense report of Alatorre was signed by Max and properly documented Junes expense report of Alatorre was signed by me after being told to do so and properly documented Julys expense report of Alatorre is NOT signed by me There is a lot of signing to do for the Monterrey Office and I am also signing all the other expenses in the Mexico City such as Employees salaries Rent Local Telephones Copiers Office Maintenance Long Distance Contract Petty Cash Air Tickets Car Maintenance and some other that might escape my mind Not to mention the EEIM documentation for the Vitro Plant There are about to enter into the country trucks with equipment for the EEIM power plant for which I am the legal rep and I have had to verify every single document I need to sign with our legal counsel getting proper approval plus service contracts banking documents and all the documentation with the authorities such as Energy Regulatory Commission Federal Commission of Electricity Secretary of Energy etc all of those requiring proper authorization procedures which I do follow There are other Corp Policies like Trading and Risk Management Procedures that are clearly writtn and I do follow daily So I totally agree with you that adherence to Enrons authorization policies are crucial and not only to your internal control but also for our business to have sustainability However I strongly believe that such policies should come from your area and if here is a communication gap we need to fill it immediately Your proposals sound very good and I ask you to help us formalize the procedures and minimize the time we spend performing this duties since it has become a burden to my commercial activities In the meantime please notify me differently if possible if there are any other exceptions or special authorization procedures in order to avoid this situation again I am copying Steve Irvin so that he knows he is back into this rewarding activity Best regards Jaime Williams Georgeanne nronXgate PM To Jaime NRON cc Louise nronXgate Wes nronXgate Subject Approvals on Monterrey expenditures Jaime While reviewing some recent expenditures out of the Monterrey office it was noted that several checks signed by you did not have properly approved supporting documentation The absence of properly approved documentation for expenditures is a violation of Enron Corporate Treasury policies and Enron North America standard operating procedure Specifically we found three expense reports which were reimbursed to Mr Jaime Alatorre for expenses from April to August that were not authorized by anyone prior to the check being signed and released to Mr Alatorre I understand that a transition has been taking place involving you and Steve Irvin as a result of the departure of Max Yzaguirre and that confusion about proper authorizations during this transition probably led to this circumstance but I wanted to let you know that adherence to Enrons authorization policies is crucial to our internal control structure and that violations will not be permitted Susan Helton will soon be discussing with you the entire process of disbursing funds out of the Monterrey and Mexico city offices in an attempt to get the internal controls in this area consistent with those in other Enron remote offices I expect some of the major changes to be as follows Mexico City petty cash account to be closed Two signatures to be required on all checkswires you and Steve Irvin Checks to be processed once a week only except emergencies which will help with the availability of you and Steve Expense reports of Jaime Williams Jaime Alatorre and Steve Irvin to be authorized by Louise Kitchen prior to being reimbursed Please call me with any questions or concerns

the events both external and intern al to Enron of the last few months I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us but I do know that what weve done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years whet her in Houston Washington London Brussels Sao Paulo etc was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i n the industries in which we have worked and for each other We even had a good time doing it The good work we do will go on for many if not all of us for some here for others elsewhere Regardless of what the future holds we should all be quite proud of what w e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished My personal app reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni ty to be part of a group that unfortunately will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks is boundless Irrespective of where t hese changes may take any one of us I will continue to do all I can to ear n your trust and respect On a more holidayrelated note for those in the US who are working this week please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in
