Chalcedon Report Sept Emphasis Key italics The reason why Americans were so psychologically unprepared for the horrors of September th is because they simply could not conceive of normal human beings carrying out a plan of such diabolical destruction Weve been led by progressive education Unitarian and liberal theology and our leftleaning media to believe that human beings are basically good and that when they do terrible things like hijacking planes they are simply responding justifiably to American or Israeli aggression And even after the events of September th there are American students and peaceniks who have learned nothing from the experience Ordinary Americans could not understand that there were human beings who would live among us enjoy the hospitality and pleasures of our free society and yet painstakingly plan to murder thousands of innocent people in the name of religion A good many Americans are indifferent to religion They enjoy Christmas and Easter but mainly as cultural events of the yearly calendar extravagantly boosted for commercial gain Religious fanaticism is something they cannot even begin to deal with Nor could Americans understand how anyone particularly those who profess to believe in God could be driven by such consummate hatred that they would gladly inflict on fellow human beings such extreme pain and cruelty Nothing in our American idea of religion toleration sense of decency and love for ones neighbor prepared us for this kind of suicidal insanity All of the preaching in liberal churches all of the humanism in the public schools have left us psychologically unprepared for a real encounter with evil And we are now being told that it could have been worse and that these Islamic fanatics are planning bigger and better attacks against us How does one understand such evil Back in the days after World War II our family in New York made contact with the familys sole survivor of the holocaust in Europe My parents extended families living in Poland had all been killed That sole survivor my parents niece had migrated to Canada with her husband whom she had met in a displaced persons camp in Germany My mother and I took the train to Montreal where we had a very emotional meeting with my cousin In the course of our conversations during our stay I asked my cousin what went through their minds when the Germans invaded Poland She said they all knew that things would be bad but we didnt know it would be that bad They had assumed that the Germans were a civilized Christian people from a highly cultivated society and were simply incapable of doing what they eventually did In fact the Germans had been very friendly to the Jews of Poland in World War I What that in time taught me is that the most civilized people in the world were capable of the worst barbarism if the circumstances made it possible The pagan Hitlerian regime is what made it all possible Of course even if my relatives had known it would be that bad what could they have done It wasnt until most of the Jews of Warsaw had been taken to the death camps that the remaining remnant decided to stage an uprising They felt it was better to die by fighting a lastditch battle and taking some of the enemy with them than merely dying as victims In that regard I thought of those passengers in the hijacked plane over Pennsylvania who decided it was better dying preventing the hijackers from killing more Americans than to die as passive victims smashing into the Capitol or White House It wasnt until I became a Calvinist that I began to understand how the Germans could do what they did John Calvin had no illusions about human nature and he found more than enough in the Bible to characterize man as innately depraved And it is this innate depravity that is the cause of evil in man The only way that innate depravity can be controlled is by belief in the God of the Bible and His laws that tell us how to live Since America was founded for the most part by Calvinists who believed in mans innate depravity they conceived of a form of government that would prevent any one man from gaining so much power as to become a dictator They believed that it wasnt power that corrupts man but man who corrupts power That Calvinist distrust of man is at the basis of our Constitutional system But it is the liberals who have tried to convince us otherwise Trust us they keep saying Give us your guns Give us your children to educate Give us your earnings Trust us But there is enough of a residual distrust of government among Americans that make them resist the liberal siren song of seduction And so all it takes to understand what happened on September th is to understand human depravity in all of its horrendous capabilities Back in colonial days children were taught to read with the New England Primer Each letter of the alphabet was taught in reference to a lesson from the Bible In teaching the letter A the lesson was In Adams fall we sinned all Powerful stuff for the children of early America Today they are taught See Spot run or its Mickey Mouse equivalent We must do better than that if we are to survive as the nation our Founding Fathers gave us Samuel L Blumenfeld wrote the lead article for WorldNetDailys October Whistle Blower a powerful indictment of Americas government education system He
