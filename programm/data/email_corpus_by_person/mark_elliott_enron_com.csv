coversation of yesterday I set out for you below the following An explanation in draft of the Dutch power market and the events leading up to the current market squeeze by certain players which we have produced and discussed for our external lawyers A schematic of arguments which we produced for external lawyers before Christmas just relating to the misapplication of capacity by TenneT A copy of our email to Clifford Chance of last Wednesday summarising the issues in order of priority for their advice Please note that purely on the swap element of this jigsaw we are attempting to arrange a conference with a Queens Counsel for next Monday afternoon Hence it may be better for our meeting with Jeff patchedin to take place next Tuesday clearly the advice on all the elements involved as set out in in toto will not be complete until we have had the conference with the QC I am due to receive tomorrow however from Clifford Chance their legal strategy report on all the other issues raised in my email item and shall forward you a copy on receipt Kind regards Mark Forwarded by Mark ElliottLONECT on Mark Elliott To cc Joe CT Roy CT Ross CT Teun Van CT Dirk Van CT Stephen CT Andreas CT Reuben CT Michael R CT Jeffrey T CT Mark CT Subject URGENT SECOND EMAIL FOLLOWING CLIFFORD CHANCE MEETING IN AMSTERDAM Dutch txn Year Issues to work up into a legal strategy STRICTLY PRIVATE CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEDGE Tjepco Following our useful meeting with yourself and your colleagues yesterday in Amsterdam I now set out below the various issues in what we consider to be the order of priority relating to Dutch transmission for the Year upon which we need your and your colleagues advice with respect to framing an entire coordinated legal strategy eg timelines scales coordination between actions Nma v Courts or both costs liabilities of Enron to defendants if we lose for Enron so as to apply the maximum effective legal pressure on the various parties and to effect a resolution to such issues as quickly as possible the longer the current situation persists the more money Enron will lose whilst at the same time allowing us to weigh up the cost benefit analysis of all the various scenarios Please note the following when planning our legal strategy Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL an English incorporated company is our company which has entered into physical electricty sales contracts to supply certain Dutch Distribution Companies The physical supply contracts are governed by Dutch law and are subject either to ICC arbitration in either Paris Rotterdam or the Hague or the NAI in Rotterdam or the Hague dependant upon the counterparty ECTRL is also a Participant on the APX Enron Capital Trade Resources International Corp ECTRIC a company incorporated in Delaware US is the Enron entity which as principal enters into financial swaps arranged through Enron Europe Finance Trading Limted EEFT an English incorporated company which is regulated by the SFA with among others Dutch Distribution companies The swap contracts have all been documented on a Deemed ISDA basis representative confirms have already been sent to you on this aspect Clearly although the first three issues are TOP PRIORITY the Secondary Priority Issues are not far behind them and so we should be obliged to receive your consolidated written report on all the issues on or before Wednesday th January as we discussed yesterday When providing that report please also let us have at the same time estimates of your fees for the whole of your team incl London and the US ballparks are fine at present broken down into fees for Clifford Chances preliminary advice including the written strategy report fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting the Sep takeorpay issues fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting the APX issues fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting any actions defences counterclaims on the swaps and or physical contracts Fee estimates for Clifford Chance prosecuting any of the Secondary Priority issues can come later Please also pay particular attention to how we might obtain evidence to the appropriate standard of market rigging on the APX etc conspiracy etc re defence counterclaim to any nonpayment by Enron on the Swaps see Points below IMMEDIATE PRIORITY Query What Court actions do we have against TenneT and or SEP re allocation of capacity by TenneT to SEP for Yr in November Issue Missallocation by TenneT of MW of crossborder capacity by TenneT to SEP first step in allocation which defined quota of balance of crossborder capacity available to the market Issue Unlawful speculative reservation or other unlawful reservation of capacity by SEP eg re non takeorpay elements Issue Unlawful retention and or unlawful application of capacity by SEP once granted capacity by TenneT blocking of essential facilities ie generation to other parties Resolution required The quickest way possible to deny Sep right to use TenneT capacity for nontake or pay elements nb relevant take or pay is energy component ie obligation to import at border cf take or pay on virtual capacity as soon as possible The quickest way possible to have that capacity released to the APX in accordance with existing use it or lose it principle or TenneT to allocate to term market under weekly contract category established by DTE as soon as possible Evidence Herkstroter report implied despatch regime implied general market consensus electricity plans DTE consultation paper on transmission reference to virtual power plants EZDTE advice which limited reservation to take or pay hence only needed if some parts were non take or pay Current despatch levels on term deals imply Sep taking MW Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ALREADY INCLUDED AS AN ISSUE IN THE EXISTING NMA COMPLAINT AGAINST TENNET NOT SEP AT PRESENT IN RESPECT OF ITS ALLOCATION PROCESS ON COMPETITION GROUNDS COMMENCED THROUGH LOEFF CLAEYS IN DEC Points to note Initial Clifford Chance view Summary proceedings against TenneT Sep Timeline needed of when to commence length of time to get to Court best methodology of getting Sep contracts before the Court etc Query value of Clifford Chance initial letter to TenneT and or Sep requesting confirmation that all Sep contracts are full takeorpay IMMEDIATE PRIORITY Query Preparation of Draft proceedings against the APX Issue Drafting of summary proceedings by ECTRL as a Participant against APX for failing to enforce to compel them to enforce the APX Rules on ensuring firm crossborder capacity prebid to prevent market manipulation Note failure of APX to enforce its Rules causes losses both to a ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Issue Query availability of shareholder action by ECTRL in concert with others as shareholders of the Exchange against APX for mismanagement in failing to enforce APX Rules leading to a damage to certain Participants and or b damage to APXs prospects as a main European power exchange Resolution required Tactics APX has published certain crossborder transmission contract audit requirements which are to come into effect on copy will faxed shortly we query effectiveness of this compromise approach plus there isnothing specific mentioned re other manipulative conduct eg crossing Hence Issue above required to be done as if APX measures fail then we may need to file suit quickly to bring matters to a head IMPORTANT Irrespective of whether or not APX audit prevents manipulation etc need to consider taking appropriate actions againstAPX or others in any event asap in order to flush out evidence re manipulation conspiracy among certain Participants re any defence counterclaims to any nonpayment on swaps etc see below Query benefit at this stage of shareholder letter to APX setting scene for mismanagement corporate action Points to note Timeline needed of when to commence length of time to get to Court etc plus re above best methodology of gathering sufficient evidence in due time for defence counterclaims on swap issues see below IMMEDIATE PRIORITY Query Do we have any legitimate grounds for nonperforming on our swap contracts physical contracts and what should be our strategy re this eg preemptive actions or defensive actions counterclaims Note certain counterparties to contracts with Enron are causing loss to Enron by what we believe is market manipulation of APX collusion to lockup market etc Certain other parties to such contracts with Enron we do not believe are party to such conduct Losses to Enron are however occurring as follows a to ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b to ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Issue Can ECTRIC legitimately withhold payments on the swaps Query availability of preemptive damages or other forms of actions against swap counterparties Query best jurisdiction esp re swaps English Dutch US Resolution needed need to obtain from a strategic perspective best jurisdictions and best course and causes of action on a preemptivebasis as far as possible to avoid claims of forum shopping and bring maximum pressure plus advice needed on whether we should take preemptive action or to defend and or counterclaim if we get sued if we do not perform on swaps or physical contracts Initial Clifford Chance view None no suitable preemptive action available to Enron defences counterclaims only All proceedings likely to be in England and subject to contracts governing law English under Art Brussels convention Dutch conflict of laws principles Highly unlikley that any US action by Enron practically possible US courts will consider forum shopping unless can show that Dutch counterparty has minimum contacts in the US means in detail even then US courts unlikely to give any appropriate relief query enforcement problems in any event Clifford Chances initial gut reaction is to withhold payment wait for counterparty to sue which would probably be by way of summary judgement approx months to get court in England If so to defeat summary proceedings thus delaying matters to full trial ECTRIC would then need to establish prima facie case for either defence on breach of implied term v difficult indeed but gut reaction is that London Commercial Court could be swayed by an argument that actual counterparty has acted in bad faith eg manipulated mkt fairly untested area and or counterclaim for conspiracy to defraud for which need to establish prima facie case of conspiracy between counterparty and others to rig the mkt etc Notes Need to thoroughly investigate all options here approx of losses could be on the swaps Need to consider evidence re mkt rigging conspiracy to defraud practically whether this could effectively be brough to light by any actions against APX see Issue of Point APX above the race between timescales of summary judgment in England versus any actions against APX under Dutch law to flush out evidence Any additional ways of securing appropriate evidence to the relevant standard of proof whether through crt actions or otherwise whether in the UK US or in the Netherlands and timescales Eg availability of putting people on the Witness Stand in the Netherlands Queries re Clifford Chance initial view a Repercussions action by counterparty not by way of summary judgment but by way of filing insolvency petition under Section IA b Any views altered re amenability of commercial crt if i Enron knew last year that APX could be manipulated if Enron itself had enterd into similar but smallerscale manipulation for short period last year Check Ability of Dutch counterparties to swaps to speculate rather than hedge by way of OTC Derivatives and any good faithintegrity issues re parties use of speculative cf hedging swaps combined with deliberate and systematic market manipulation by swap counterparts Query Any SFA repercussions for EEFT Issue Liability of ECTRL under physical supply contracts Does liability cap on physical contracts work if ECTRL fails intentionally to deliver Does consequential losses exclusion on phyiscal contracts work if ECTRL fails to deliver Strategy ie should we fail to deliver pay undisputed amount of bill and dispute rest of bill and let counterparty take us to arbitration OR can this have any adverse repercussions re any other opart of our legal strategy SECONDARY PRIORITY Query What actions do we have against TenneT to recoup our losses re allocation of capacity by TenneT for Yr in November Issue Misapplication in law of capacity ie MW by TenneT to Market parties eg Enron after Sep allocation allocation favoured incumbents based on market share this caused a new entrant such as Enron loss Issue General unreasonable behaviour lack of good faith of TenneT Misleading market with early rules addition of extra unfounded rules post Nov in reasonable knowledge that market parties had already acted on earlier information from TenneT Jan closing Dutch market to imports query whether this was also for the UCTE system support activities suspect not in an unreasonable fashion ie changed procedures when it had no need so to do The normal procedures whereby TenneT curtailed in the event of a problem on the day would have been sufficient to maintain system stability Disingenous allocation of MW in offpeak capacity night at the same time as indicating to the market that no more than or MW was expected by TenneT to be available for use due to Seps plant despatch regime Reasonable action would have been to allocate no more than the MW to Sep and the market on a term basis with any additional capacity available on a given day treated as uncertain spot capacity and allocated to the APX Lack of checking andor other disingenuity re failure properly to check Sep take or pay obligations Lack of transparency of information eg French grid problems result in cut of MW available to APX No assistance from TenneT either to provide guidance as to the real extent or duration of the problem or to take reasonable steps to mitigate the problem by eg cooperating with market parties aiming to put in place offsetting transit arrangements to alleviate the congestion PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE SAME EXISTING NMA COMPLAINT ON COMPETION GROUNDS REFERRED TO IN ABOVE COMMENCED THROUGH LOEFF CLAEYS IN DEC Resolution required Damages against TenneT Evidence Herkstroter report implied despatch regime implied general market consensus electricity plans DTE consultation paper on transmission reference to virtual power plants EZDTE advice which limited reservation to take or pay hence only needed if some parts were non take or pay Current despatch levels on term deals imply Sep taking MW Sep newspaper quotes intent to use MW day and night intended block on capacity and refusal to contemplate change to superpeak pricing Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc SECONDARY PRIORITY Query ability of Enron to claim damages against APX for losses suffered owing to failure of APX to enforce its Rules and to allow gaming etc Note failure of APX to enforce have enforced its Rules causes losses both to a ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Resolution required Damages against the APX SECONDARY PRIORITY Query Actions against APX Participants for manipulating the APX DAM causing losses to Enron Note manipulation of APX DAM by certain Participants causes losses both to a ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of others parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Resolution required What action can we take against APX Participants i to prevent them further manipulating APX and ii claiming our losses against them on both ECTRLs physical supply contracts and ECTRICs swaps In particular Query availability of injunction summary proceedings against APX Participants to prevent them from manipulating APX DAM SECONDARY PRIORITY Query Actions against SEP a Plant despatch see below re collusive behaviour b Protocol Sep refusing to contemplate changes to superpeak charges which in no way bear reasonable relation to supplydemand or electricity production costs Query availability to Enron of injunctive andor other relief against Sep for a unlawful application and retention eg query damages action against Sep and or b nature plant despatch and or c conduct re Protocol Evidence Herkstroter report implied despatch regime implied general market consensus electricity plans DTE consultation paper on transmission reference to virtual power plants EZDTE advice which limited reservation to take or pay hence only needed if some parts were non take or pay Current despatch levels on term deals imply Sep taking MW Sep newspaper quotes intent to use MW day and night intended block on capacity and refusal to contemplate change to superpeak pricing Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc Query Actions available to Enron against Parties for collusive behaviour Supply market actions Deliberate and systematic attempts by certain parties predominantly large Dutch distcos to deny new entrants ability to access capacityenergy at reaonable prices by virtue of a withholding capacity within NL ie Protocol and b breaching APX rules gaming in such a fashion as to block legitimate access for those parties with foreign txn to sell legitimate volumes on APX consistent with APX rules Effect of withholding capacity from market compounded by collusive actions to manipulate APX prices by strategic bidding Protocol Collusive behaviour suspected by Dutch Distcos re locking parties out of recontracting and use of Protocol to disadvantage of new market entrants eg see EnergieNed letter now in public domain note transcript of Wed Arnhem Court case on Protocol re intent of parties to keep market short APX Art APX DAM Regs

<28755281.1075860517437.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.elliott@enron.com,2000-02-21 03:31:00,Update on situation with Enrons physical and financial deals in the Dutch power market Cc Jeff To give you an update on certain specific nondeliveries nonpayments in the Dutch power market I would report as follows Nondeliveries of physical power by Enron to various counterparties I understand that Enron recommenced deliveries to our counterparties approximately days ago This was because Enron was allowed to contract domestic power in the Netherlands in a process from which Enron had peviously been excluded The long and short of it is however that we are now only dealing with the historical nondelivery situation ie our disputes over the amounts invoiced to us for nondelivery Please note in this regard Re nondeliveries to REMU REMU were billing us everday for nondeliveries at superpeak prices ie Euros MWh or higher for all hours We disputed properly all those bills under the invoice dispute procedures set out in our contract on the basis that we believe that we did not fail to supply all hours and or the prices for the hours when we did fail to supply were not always at superpeak The portions of their invoices which we did not dispute we paid in due form We have not received any bills from them since on or about th February The disputed amount of their previous invoices amounts to M Initally REMU did not try to agree with us what the figure should be despite our invitations to them to discuss the issue with us Commercial met with REMU during the week before last to discuss the issue and REMU were still in the process of deliberating what the figure should be However they now tell us that they will claim full damages and not just cover damages against us and will send us an invoice next week in this regard We have written to them formally to deny their claims in this regard In addition please note that REMU decided not to pay Enron M in January with regard to deliveries which we made to them in December on the mistaken assumption that they could payment net that against their nondelivery claims We sent REMU last Friday a notice requiring payment for December deliveries and reserving all our rights on this issue my instructions from Commercial until last Friday were not to send this notice as it might have jeopardised the delicate negotiations over the amounts which we truely owe them on our nondeliveries On the basis of their current stance ie to claim full damages against us etc I secured Commercials consent to send the notice Commercial also mentioned this nonexistence of a legal basis to withhold the January payment when they met REMU during the week before last Re nondeliveries to ENECO We disputed a couple of their invoices in accordance with contractual provisions as per REMUs above They claim that they then sent us a letter a copy of which we never received to the best of our knowledge and in fact a copy of which they have since failed to provide us despite our requests claiming that we were in default under the contract although not actually closing us out Clearly we do not know what their letter which failed to arrive said nor have they been able to explain it verbally Hence we are waiting for a copy of the missing letter Value of remaining contract M Re nondeliveries to Westland Maastricht They have not invoiced us yet counterparties relaxed Commercial discussing reasonable cover damages payment to these counterparties for our previous nondeliveries Nonpayments of monies owed to Enron on swaps Last year we bought ie we receive floating price some whole year swaps the underlying reference price source being the APX from these counterparties Electrabel Bayernwerk Norsk Hydro First payment date on all the swaps was none of them have paid us Electrabel cries of APX has been rigged etc etc wants to escrow the money which they we to us We have written to them under the ISDA Form crystallising their default date as at close th February and reserving all our rights Clearly we have also refused to allow them to place the money they owe us on escrow and that they should pay it to us forthwith approx Euros m for January Commercial having reasonable discussions with Electrabel on this matter at present hence we are not closing them out at this stage although we have reserved all our rights Signed Deemed ISDA confirm for this deal thus no dispute over the deal per se Bayernwerk mainly using the old chestnut we didnt sign your confirm and you didnt sign ours hence no deal total nonsense in law Correspondence gone back to them telling them that their excuses arent legally valid and to pay up reserving all our rights There is a query over whether ISDA Form would or would not apply to this deal even if it was not to apply they are still liable for debt or for anticipatory repudiatory breach of contract as they have told us that they wont pay as the do not acknowledge that the swap exists owing to no confirm signed between the parties although they acknowledge the terms of the deal Payment due to us on was M Value of entire contract to us M We have reviewed the tapes etc and it is pretty clear that we are in the right Joe Gold has given us the green light to sue Bayernwerk instructions have gone out to Ed Patton at Clifford Chance to commence proceedings Norsk Hydro last couple of days we understand that they acknowledge that a swap was done conversation between Commercial and Norsk Hydro of yesterday on tape but that they didnt want to pay on account of adverse market conditions Default letter gone out to them and Joe Gold has given us the green light to sue them instructions have gone out to Ed Patton at Clifford Chance to commence proceedings Payment due to us on was M Value of entire contract to us M Amounts Enron owes to swap counterparties Note that all payments for January were made to counterparties by Enron relating to all our swap contracts where we had sold floating price being the APX for Evidence gathering still going on re those counterparties who we know rigged the market to check whether we have a strong enough case to win court actions should we not pay them on the swaps later on and get sued Kind regards Mark

email of yesterday evening to Mark Haedicke and Scott Sefton re the impact of English law on a potential Equity trading desk based in London Kind regards Mark Forwarded by Mark ElliottLONECT on AM Mark Elliott PM To Mark E CT Scott CT cc Subject Proposed London Equity Trading Desk I have reviewed the above proposal which includes having had some indepth conference calls with Slaughter May London and conclude that the project is technically and legally viable provided that the points listed below are dealt with Mark once you have read this note if you would like to discuss the contents with Scott and me please do not hesitate to give us a call SFA Authorisation and Structure On account of the potential frequency and size of trading even on an executiononly basis for ECT Investments Inc the London Desk should be authorised by the SFA The personnel involved in the activity should be registered with the SFA as at least Securities Representatives and preferably as General Representatives Accordingly subject to Tax Departments input the London traders should be located in EEFT already SFAregulated which would act as arranger or agent for the existing Houstonbased equity trading corporation ECT Investments Inc the latter as principal Subject to Tax and other internal considerations it would also be possible for EEFT to act as agent to do this business for as principal either ECTRIC the proposed replacement vehicle for ECTRIC or a new UK unregulated entity the latter would apply if a UK book was required A UK entity as principal would be unregulated if it was a purely passive booking company Provided that the ultimate principal is either ECT Investments Inc ECTRIC or an unregulated UK principal there should not be any UK regulatory capital requirements The SFA would need to be informed in advance of our intention to have an equity trading capability in London and EEFTs SFA business profile would need to be extended to cover both arranging and dealing as agent in respect of equities Transaction Reporting As the business would be SFA regulated per the above SFA Rule would require all transactions to be Transaction Reported for pure cash equity business wherever the equities are listed this would be accomplished by computerentry of trade details which would then download to one of the London Stock Exchanges LSEs systems known as either SEQUAL or CHECKING The purpose of such reporting is not only to enable the LSE and SFA to establish daily market volumes etc but also for example to provide the relevant information to the LSEs surveillance unit which actively monitors all trades for signs of Insider Dealing Systems impact On the above structure there should be no extra systems requirements except PC screens for the traders having feeds of market quotes market information eg Reuters Telerate etc potentially a computerlink for settlement purposes a computerlink for the Transaction Reporting of executed deals to the LSE see above a computerlink to produce exception reports of executed deals to enable a Compliance Department to monitor for Disclosable Interests in Shares see below a computerlink to produce reports of executed deals for monitoring against the Watch and Restricted Lists see Insider Dealing below Accountants eg Arthur Andersen would be the best placed to advise on the correct form of computerlinks especially those for Transaction Reporting purposes Disclosure of Interests in shares Re UK listed companies there are the following disclosures to be made of equity interests S Companies Act acquisition of interest or more or disposal to below a interest or acquisition of each whole above a interest of a UK Public Cos voting capital requires to be disclosed to the company Group interests concert party interests are aggregated to arrive at the thresholds and interest includes a right or option to acquire shares Substantial Acquisition Rules acquisition of over interest in a UK public company requires separate disclosure to the Company and if listed to the LSE Rule Takeover Code acquisition of or more of UK public companys voting shares leads to a requirement to make a cash offer for the remainder S Companies Act UK public companies can request at any time an entity to disclose to the company particulars of their and other persons interests in the companys share capital including such details for the last three years Rule Takeover Code during an offer period relating to a UK public company and the offer is a securities exchange offer persons owning or controlling directly or indirectly or more of relevant securities of that company including cashsettled derivatives must disclose such interests to the TakeOver Panel Please note that there may be similar rules in other jurisdictions depending on where the relevant equities are listed indeed in some jurisdictions there may be prohibitions on foreign ownership of equities Insider Dealing Looking just to the UK legislation The Criminal Justice Act the various criminal offences of Insider Dealing are committed basically when an individual has Inside Information meaning unpublished pricesensitive information concerning the securities of an entity or entities whether UK or nonUK which are officially listed in any State within the European Economic Area or admitted to dealing or quoted on a Regulated Market eg including the major European markets NASDAQ etc Please note that pricesensitive means likely to have a significant effect on the price of any securities not just those of the entity or entities in respect of which one has the knowledge and securities includes shares debentures options to subscribe for shares debentures depository receipts futures and CFDs Once in knowledgeable possession of insider information the offences are commited if one deals in priceaffected securities in relation to that information or encourages another to so deal or discloses the information The offence is punishable by imprisonment and or fines The offences are highly technical and there are certain defences available The manner in which to try to prevent the internal commission of the offences is to put in place simply established and effective Chinese Walls between those individuals who would be involved in the Equity Trading facility and others in within the Enron Group who may have such inside information to prevent the potential flows of Inside Information between those with such information and the Equity Traders in London Both I and Slaughter May feel that potentially replicating in London the Enron Chinese Wall policy actively followed in Houston could suffice in this respect as it is generally felt that the US requirements should be at least as stringent as those required in the UK Alan Aronowitz is in the process of sending me Houstons policy in this regard for review and upon receipt that policy will be reviewed accordingly However the relevant Chinese Walls would need to be put in place for Insider Dealing purposes between in my and Slaughters views a on the one side the Equity Traders and b on the other side originators and traders and persons involved in any corporate finance MA Joint Venture and financing activity Not only would the Chinese Walls need to be implemented but also they would need to be actively monitored by a Compliance Department in London to ensure that they were being observed and effective In addition to the Houston Chinese Wall policy there should be implemented both a Watch List and a Restricted List procedure I understand the latter already exists and would need to be combined with additions to such list in London the Watch List does not actively prevent trading in relevant securities but is an intermediate step before a stock is placed on the Restricted List ie companies in which Enron is involved in sensitive transactions would be placed on such a list and an internal Compliance Department should then actively monitor for any unusual deals by the Equity Traders eg by volume etc in stocks of the Companies on such list If any irregular trading activity is then spotted it could be internally investigated Obviously an internal procedure would need to be established to gather information on sensitive transactions so that they could be placed on the Watch Restricted Lists as appropriate Other Confidential Information In addition to any specific Insider Information various Enron Group entities will be party to specific Confidentiality Agreements or other forms of Agreement eg Master Agreements containing confidentiality clauses with third parties pursuant to which the Enron entities may have confidentiality obligations to those third parties and which may prevent the contracting Enron entities from disclosing certain information to affiliated Enron entities Obviously in order to comply with our various obligations in this regard we would need either to check each contract or ensure that Enron personnel were aware of their obligations in this regard and never disclosed to the London Equity traders any information covered by the confidentiality obligations The Watch List could be used to log for monitoring purposes companies to whom Enron owes confidentiality obligations Both with regard to Insider Information and this form of confidential information employees would need to be actively trained to ensure that only generally available market sentiment on a third party could be passed on to the London Equity traders and not more specific information Compliance Department If this proposal moves ahead my suggestion is that Enron in London would need to hire an experienced Compliance professional for the following purposes active implementation of review of and consistent monitoring of the Chinese Wall policy active monitoring of executed deals against Watch and Restricted Lists active monitoring of executed deals for Disclosable Interests in Shares in the UK and similar rules and prohibitions in other jurisdictions handling SFA and LSE queries on Transaction Reporting handling potential LSE and Takeover Panel queries on executed Transactions and running continuous training courses for Enron personnel on Insider Dealing confidentiality obligations etc In addition such person could have responsibility for the implementation of monitoring of and ensuring compliance with SFA Conduct of Business Rules and Moneylaundering compliance and any relevant exchange rules firmwide in London across all of Enrons business eg its OTC Derivatives business Kind regards Mark

<15533105.1075859882039.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.elliott@enron.com,1999-02-23 08:03:00,Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Cc Further to my email to you of last week on the above subject I have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local Indian Counsel Crawford Bailey Co on the above topic in January That due diligence reveals the following Prior Reserve Bank of India RBI approval required to do business in India If Enron is considered to be doing business in India which it would for example if we had a branch or entity there we shall require the prior consent of the RBI under Section a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA eg to set up the branch or entity Please note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel th January Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the RBI to do business in India This needs to be revisited as to the requirements Repatriation of proceeds Exchange Control Please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI such approval would state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated eg to the USA or not I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it We also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation FX Interest Rate dealings A It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate Products for the Enron Group ie an internal Treasury Desk to trade with dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the RBI B FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by the FERA Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA It is not clear what are the exact ramifications of dealings in contravention of FERA this needs to be investigated C What are the Rules of FERA see A above It appears that the RBI requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates and authorised dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated deals The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the dealer It appears however that there was a relaxation of the Rules shortly before the due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a backtoback basis without seeking the approval of the RBI These transactions are the following Interest Rate Swaps Currency Swaps Coupon Swaps Purchase of Interest Rate CAPSCollars Forward rate agreements In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers are required to ensure that i The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan transactions ii The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of the loan iii The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the underlying loan iv The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved a once and for all basis is sufficient the relevant financial limits and the authorised designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of underlying loan transactions Hence query eg whether a simple currency swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption and if not query how one obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this This needs to be investigated If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a transaction Speculative transactions are void Please note that transactions entered into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section of the Indian Contract Act Indian counsel opines that provided the rate or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid Capacity and Authority It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that the transactions were covered by its objects clause and similarly that our counterparties objects clauses covered the products in which we wish to deal there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside their capacity Furthermore in relation to authority to enter into transactions it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties documentation in this regard Derivatives and Borrowings If we were to establish a company in India we would be subject to the Companies Act in relation to limitation on the quantum of monies which it could borrow Any borrowing in excess of stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the company in general meeting Accordingly in relation to derivatives transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency one would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by the members of the company in general meeting The power to borrow itself must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors Collateral It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided received for example in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India would be legal valid and binding as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its insolvency however the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance The due diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due diligence consider outright transfers of collateral eg under English law rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral situated locally in India these issues need to be checked Choice of Law and Arbitration It would appear that Indian entities may enter into agreements eg ISDA Masters governed by New York or US law and it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work Insurance business Indian counsel opined that interest rateFX derivative transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India Income Tax Please note that if an Enron entity or a branch of an Enron entity was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake such business then any income arising to the Enron entity branch in India from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax Please note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA UK and Singapore with India However no details of rates of taxation or further explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in the opinion GrossUp Clauses Contractual grossup clauses re withholdings eg the standard grossup clause in the ISDA Master would need to be approved by the RBI Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved Closeout netting Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel the existing due diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum eg if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a closeout against them in their insolvency This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel Oral Contracts Please note that in relation to oral contracts whilst it is possible to sue upon an oral contract in India it is not possible to take any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the permission of the RBI under section of FERA Indian counsel does not state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to obtain Mark I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above before I take any further action on the above Kind regards Mark Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a subsidiary in India and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the US any proceeds of such business there did not appear to be any other trade control or other laws which would inhibit Enrons ability to do business in India

but I have just returned this week after a few weeks of vacation and your email together with about others have only just arrived on my PC today owing to a glitch which occurred with my machine whilst I was away I have finished the due diligence on this the first round was completed some months ago and preliminary results were given to Mark Haedicke and Harry Arora not to Gary as I never knew that he was involved Out of that first round of due diligence several questions arose which required to be bottomed out and despite instructing Indian counsel in April on those additional questions they never actuallly finalised their advice on this aspect until a few days before I went on vacation Anyway that has now been done Im starting my secondment in Houston for two months from next Monday As I am trying to sort out things here today and tomorrow in preparation for my absence from London would you mind if I gave you the full lowdown on this one early next week faceto face Kind regards Mark Shari Stack AM To Mark CT cc Mark ECT Legal CT Subject Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Have you spoken with Gary Hickerson about your findings re India He was asking me today about the status of our due diligence review and asked if I could be his point person with respect to this exercise Could you pls emailmail me any further correspondence re India Also maybe we could have a quick chat tomorrow as to what your conclusions are at this point regarding trading in India Many thanks Shari Forwarded by Shari StackHOUECT on PM From Mark ECT Legal Taylor PM To Shari CT cc Subject Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Forwarded by Mark ECT Legal TaylorHOUECT on PM Mark Elliott AM To Mark E CT cc Mark ECT Legal CT Alan B CT Scott CT Subject Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Mark Further to my email to you of last week on the above subject I have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local Indian Counsel Crawford Bailey Co on the above topic in January That due diligence reveals the following Prior Reserve Bank of India RBI approval required to do business in India If Enron is considered to be doing business in India which it would for example if we had a branch or entity there we shall require the prior consent of the RBI under Section a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA eg to set up the branch or entity Please note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel th January Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the RBI to do business in India This needs to be revisited as to the requirements Repatriation of proceeds Exchange Control Please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI such approval would state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated eg to the USA or not I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it We also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation FX Interest Rate dealings A It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate Products for the Enron Group ie an internal Treasury Desk to trade with dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the RBI B FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by the FERA Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA It is not clear what are the exact ramifications of dealings in contravention of FERA this needs to be investigated C What are the Rules of FERA see A above It appears that the RBI requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates and authorised dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated deals The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the dealer It appears however that there was a relaxation of the Rules shortly before the due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a backtoback basis without seeking the approval of the RBI These transactions are the following Interest Rate Swaps Currency Swaps Coupon Swaps Purchase of Interest Rate CAPSCollars Forward rate agreements In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers are required to ensure that i The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan transactions ii The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of the loan iii The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the underlying loan iv The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved a once and for all basis is sufficient the relevant financial limits and the authorised designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of underlying loan transactions Hence query eg whether a simple currency swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption and if not query how one obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this This needs to be investigated If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a transaction Speculative transactions are void Please note that transactions entered into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section of the Indian Contract Act Indian counsel opines that provided the rate or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid Capacity and Authority It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that the transactions were covered by its objects clause and similarly that our counterparties objects clauses covered the products in which we wish to deal there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside their capacity Furthermore in relation to authority to enter into transactions it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties documentation in this regard Derivatives and Borrowings If we were to establish a company in India we would be subject to the Companies Act in relation to limitation on the quantum of monies which it could borrow Any borrowing in excess of stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the company in general meeting Accordingly in relation to derivatives transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency one would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by the members of the company in general meeting The power to borrow itself must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors Collateral It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided received for example in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India would be legal valid and binding as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its insolvency however the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance The due diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due diligence consider outright transfers of collateral eg under English law rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral situated locally in India these issues need to be checked Choice of Law and Arbitration It would appear that Indian entities may enter into agreements eg ISDA Masters governed by New York or US law and it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work Insurance business Indian counsel opined that interest rateFX derivative transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India Income Tax Please note that if an Enron entity or a branch of an Enron entity was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake such business then any income arising to the Enron entity branch in India from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax Please note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA UK and Singapore with India However no details of rates of taxation or further explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in the opinion GrossUp Clauses Contractual grossup clauses re withholdings eg the standard grossup clause in the ISDA Master would need to be approved by the RBI Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved Closeout netting Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel the existing due diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum eg if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a closeout against them in their insolvency This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel Oral Contracts Please note that in relation to oral contracts whilst it is possible to sue upon an oral contract in India it is not possible to take any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the permission of the RBI under section of FERA Indian counsel does not state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to obtain Mark I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above before I take any further action on the above Kind regards Mark Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a subsidiary in India and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the US any proceeds of such business there did not appear to be any other trade control or other laws which would inhibit Enrons ability to do business in India

but I have just returned this week after a few weeks of vacation and your email together with about others have only just arrived on my PC today owing to a glitch which occurred with my machine whilst I was away I have finished the due diligence on this the first round was completed some months ago and preliminary results were given to Mark Haedicke and Harry Arora not to Gary as I never knew that he was involved Out of that first round of due diligence several questions arose which required to be bottomed out and despite instructing Indian counsel in April on those additional questions they never actuallly finalised their advice on this aspect until a few days before I went on vacation Anyway that has now been done Im starting my secondment in Houston for two months from next Monday As I am trying to sort out things here today and tomorrow in preparation for my absence from London would you mind if I gave you the full lowdown on this one early next week faceto face Kind regards Mark Shari Stack AM To Mark CT cc Mark ECT Legal CT Subject Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Have you spoken with Gary Hickerson about your findings re India He was asking me today about the status of our due diligence review and asked if I could be his point person with respect to this exercise Could you pls emailmail me any further correspondence re India Also maybe we could have a quick chat tomorrow as to what your conclusions are at this point regarding trading in India Many thanks Shari Forwarded by Shari StackHOUECT on PM From Mark ECT Legal Taylor PM To Shari CT cc Subject Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Forwarded by Mark ECT Legal TaylorHOUECT on PM Mark Elliott AM To Mark E CT cc Mark ECT Legal CT Alan B CT Scott CT Subject Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Mark Further to my email to you of last week on the above subject I have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local Indian Counsel Crawford Bailey Co on the above topic in January That due diligence reveals the following Prior Reserve Bank of India RBI approval required to do business in India If Enron is considered to be doing business in India which it would for example if we had a branch or entity there we shall require the prior consent of the RBI under Section a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA eg to set up the branch or entity Please note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel th January Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the RBI to do business in India This needs to be revisited as to the requirements Repatriation of proceeds Exchange Control Please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI such approval would state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated eg to the USA or not I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it We also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation FX Interest Rate dealings A It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate Products for the Enron Group ie an internal Treasury Desk to trade with dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the RBI B FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by the FERA Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA It is not clear what are the exact ramifications of dealings in contravention of FERA this needs to be investigated C What are the Rules of FERA see A above It appears that the RBI requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates and authorised dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated deals The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the dealer It appears however that there was a relaxation of the Rules shortly before the due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a backtoback basis without seeking the approval of the RBI These transactions are the following Interest Rate Swaps Currency Swaps Coupon Swaps Purchase of Interest Rate CAPSCollars Forward rate agreements In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers are required to ensure that i The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan transactions ii The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of the loan iii The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the underlying loan iv The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved a once and for all basis is sufficient the relevant financial limits and the authorised designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of underlying loan transactions Hence query eg whether a simple currency swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption and if not query how one obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this This needs to be investigated If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a transaction Speculative transactions are void Please note that transactions entered into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section of the Indian Contract Act Indian counsel opines that provided the rate or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid Capacity and Authority It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that the transactions were covered by its objects clause and similarly that our counterparties objects clauses covered the products in which we wish to deal there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside their capacity Furthermore in relation to authority to enter into transactions it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties documentation in this regard Derivatives and Borrowings If we were to establish a company in India we would be subject to the Companies Act in relation to limitation on the quantum of monies which it could borrow Any borrowing in excess of stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the company in general meeting Accordingly in relation to derivatives transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency one would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by the members of the company in general meeting The power to borrow itself must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors Collateral It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided received for example in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India would be legal valid and binding as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its insolvency however the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance The due diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due diligence consider outright transfers of collateral eg under English law rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral situated locally in India these issues need to be checked Choice of Law and Arbitration It would appear that Indian entities may enter into agreements eg ISDA Masters governed by New York or US law and it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work Insurance business Indian counsel opined that interest rateFX derivative transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India Income Tax Please note that if an Enron entity or a branch of an Enron entity was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake such business then any income arising to the Enron entity branch in India from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax Please note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA UK and Singapore with India However no details of rates of taxation or further explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in the opinion GrossUp Clauses Contractual grossup clauses re withholdings eg the standard grossup clause in the ISDA Master would need to be approved by the RBI Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved Closeout netting Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel the existing due diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum eg if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a closeout against them in their insolvency This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel Oral Contracts Please note that in relation to oral contracts whilst it is possible to sue upon an oral contract in India it is not possible to take any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the permission of the RBI under section of FERA Indian counsel does not state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to obtain Mark I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above before I take any further action on the above Kind regards Mark Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a subsidiary in India and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the US any proceeds of such business there did not appear to be any other trade control or other laws which would inhibit Enrons ability to do business in India

email of yesterday evening to Mark Haedicke and Scott Sefton re the impact of English law on a potential Equity trading desk based in London Kind regards Mark Forwarded by Mark ElliottLONECT on AM Mark Elliott PM To Mark E CT Scott CT cc Subject Proposed London Equity Trading Desk I have reviewed the above proposal which includes having had some indepth conference calls with Slaughter May London and conclude that the project is technically and legally viable provided that the points listed below are dealt with Mark once you have read this note if you would like to discuss the contents with Scott and me please do not hesitate to give us a call SFA Authorisation and Structure On account of the potential frequency and size of trading even on an executiononly basis for ECT Investments Inc the London Desk should be authorised by the SFA The personnel involved in the activity should be registered with the SFA as at least Securities Representatives and preferably as General Representatives Accordingly subject to Tax Departments input the London traders should be located in EEFT already SFAregulated which would act as arranger or agent for the existing Houstonbased equity trading corporation ECT Investments Inc the latter as principal Subject to Tax and other internal considerations it would also be possible for EEFT to act as agent to do this business for as principal either ECTRIC the proposed replacement vehicle for ECTRIC or a new UK unregulated entity the latter would apply if a UK book was required A UK entity as principal would be unregulated if it was a purely passive booking company Provided that the ultimate principal is either ECT Investments Inc ECTRIC or an unregulated UK principal there should not be any UK regulatory capital requirements The SFA would need to be informed in advance of our intention to have an equity trading capability in London and EEFTs SFA business profile would need to be extended to cover both arranging and dealing as agent in respect of equities Transaction Reporting As the business would be SFA regulated per the above SFA Rule would require all transactions to be Transaction Reported for pure cash equity business wherever the equities are listed this would be accomplished by computerentry of trade details which would then download to one of the London Stock Exchanges LSEs systems known as either SEQUAL or CHECKING The purpose of such reporting is not only to enable the LSE and SFA to establish daily market volumes etc but also for example to provide the relevant information to the LSEs surveillance unit which actively monitors all trades for signs of Insider Dealing Systems impact On the above structure there should be no extra systems requirements except PC screens for the traders having feeds of market quotes market information eg Reuters Telerate etc potentially a computerlink for settlement purposes a computerlink for the Transaction Reporting of executed deals to the LSE see above a computerlink to produce exception reports of executed deals to enable a Compliance Department to monitor for Disclosable Interests in Shares see below a computerlink to produce reports of executed deals for monitoring against the Watch and Restricted Lists see Insider Dealing below Accountants eg Arthur Andersen would be the best placed to advise on the correct form of computerlinks especially those for Transaction Reporting purposes Disclosure of Interests in shares Re UK listed companies there are the following disclosures to be made of equity interests S Companies Act acquisition of interest or more or disposal to below a interest or acquisition of each whole above a interest of a UK Public Cos voting capital requires to be disclosed to the company Group interests concert party interests are aggregated to arrive at the thresholds and interest includes a right or option to acquire shares Substantial Acquisition Rules acquisition of over interest in a UK public company requires separate disclosure to the Company and if listed to the LSE Rule Takeover Code acquisition of or more of UK public companys voting shares leads to a requirement to make a cash offer for the remainder S Companies Act UK public companies can request at any time an entity to disclose to the company particulars of their and other persons interests in the companys share capital including such details for the last three years Rule Takeover Code during an offer period relating to a UK public company and the offer is a securities exchange offer persons owning or controlling directly or indirectly or more of relevant securities of that company including cashsettled derivatives must disclose such interests to the TakeOver Panel Please note that there may be similar rules in other jurisdictions depending on where the relevant equities are listed indeed in some jurisdictions there may be prohibitions on foreign ownership of equities Insider Dealing Looking just to the UK legislation The Criminal Justice Act the various criminal offences of Insider Dealing are committed basically when an individual has Inside Information meaning unpublished pricesensitive information concerning the securities of an entity or entities whether UK or nonUK which are officially listed in any State within the European Economic Area or admitted to dealing or quoted on a Regulated Market eg including the major European markets NASDAQ etc Please note that pricesensitive means likely to have a significant effect on the price of any securities not just those of the entity or entities in respect of which one has the knowledge and securities includes shares debentures options to subscribe for shares debentures depository receipts futures and CFDs Once in knowledgeable possession of insider information the offences are commited if one deals in priceaffected securities in relation to that information or encourages another to so deal or discloses the information The offence is punishable by imprisonment and or fines The offences are highly technical and there are certain defences available The manner in which to try to prevent the internal commission of the offences is to put in place simply established and effective Chinese Walls between those individuals who would be involved in the Equity Trading facility and others in within the Enron Group who may have such inside information to prevent the potential flows of Inside Information between those with such information and the Equity Traders in London Both I and Slaughter May feel that potentially replicating in London the Enron Chinese Wall policy actively followed in Houston could suffice in this respect as it is generally felt that the US requirements should be at least as stringent as those required in the UK Alan Aronowitz is in the process of sending me Houstons policy in this regard for review and upon receipt that policy will be reviewed accordingly However the relevant Chinese Walls would need to be put in place for Insider Dealing purposes between in my and Slaughters views a on the one side the Equity Traders and b on the other side originators and traders and persons involved in any corporate finance MA Joint Venture and financing activity Not only would the Chinese Walls need to be implemented but also they would need to be actively monitored by a Compliance Department in London to ensure that they were being observed and effective In addition to the Houston Chinese Wall policy there should be implemented both a Watch List and a Restricted List procedure I understand the latter already exists and would need to be combined with additions to such list in London the Watch List does not actively prevent trading in relevant securities but is an intermediate step before a stock is placed on the Restricted List ie companies in which Enron is involved in sensitive transactions would be placed on such a list and an internal Compliance Department should then actively monitor for any unusual deals by the Equity Traders eg by volume etc in stocks of the Companies on such list If any irregular trading activity is then spotted it could be internally investigated Obviously an internal procedure would need to be established to gather information on sensitive transactions so that they could be placed on the Watch Restricted Lists as appropriate Other Confidential Information In addition to any specific Insider Information various Enron Group entities will be party to specific Confidentiality Agreements or other forms of Agreement eg Master Agreements containing confidentiality clauses with third parties pursuant to which the Enron entities may have confidentiality obligations to those third parties and which may prevent the contracting Enron entities from disclosing certain information to affiliated Enron entities Obviously in order to comply with our various obligations in this regard we would need either to check each contract or ensure that Enron personnel were aware of their obligations in this regard and never disclosed to the London Equity traders any information covered by the confidentiality obligations The Watch List could be used to log for monitoring purposes companies to whom Enron owes confidentiality obligations Both with regard to Insider Information and this form of confidential information employees would need to be actively trained to ensure that only generally available market sentiment on a third party could be passed on to the London Equity traders and not more specific information Compliance Department If this proposal moves ahead my suggestion is that Enron in London would need to hire an experienced Compliance professional for the following purposes active implementation of review of and consistent monitoring of the Chinese Wall policy active monitoring of executed deals against Watch and Restricted Lists active monitoring of executed deals for Disclosable Interests in Shares in the UK and similar rules and prohibitions in other jurisdictions handling SFA and LSE queries on Transaction Reporting handling potential LSE and Takeover Panel queries on executed Transactions and running continuous training courses for Enron personnel on Insider Dealing confidentiality obligations etc In addition such person could have responsibility for the implementation of monitoring of and ensuring compliance with SFA Conduct of Business Rules and Moneylaundering compliance and any relevant exchange rules firmwide in London across all of Enrons business eg its OTC Derivatives business Kind regards Mark

<30808054.1075860086337.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.elliott@enron.com,1999-02-23 08:03:00,Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India Cc Further to my email to you of last week on the above subject I have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local Indian Counsel Crawford Bailey Co on the above topic in January That due diligence reveals the following Prior Reserve Bank of India RBI approval required to do business in India If Enron is considered to be doing business in India which it would for example if we had a branch or entity there we shall require the prior consent of the RBI under Section a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA eg to set up the branch or entity Please note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel th January Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the RBI to do business in India This needs to be revisited as to the requirements Repatriation of proceeds Exchange Control Please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI such approval would state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated eg to the USA or not I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it We also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation FX Interest Rate dealings A It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate Products for the Enron Group ie an internal Treasury Desk to trade with dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the RBI B FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by the FERA Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA It is not clear what are the exact ramifications of dealings in contravention of FERA this needs to be investigated C What are the Rules of FERA see A above It appears that the RBI requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates and authorised dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated deals The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the dealer It appears however that there was a relaxation of the Rules shortly before the due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a backtoback basis without seeking the approval of the RBI These transactions are the following Interest Rate Swaps Currency Swaps Coupon Swaps Purchase of Interest Rate CAPSCollars Forward rate agreements In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers are required to ensure that i The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan transactions ii The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of the loan iii The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the underlying loan iv The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved a once and for all basis is sufficient the relevant financial limits and the authorised designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of underlying loan transactions Hence query eg whether a simple currency swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption and if not query how one obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this This needs to be investigated If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a transaction Speculative transactions are void Please note that transactions entered into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section of the Indian Contract Act Indian counsel opines that provided the rate or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid Capacity and Authority It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that the transactions were covered by its objects clause and similarly that our counterparties objects clauses covered the products in which we wish to deal there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside their capacity Furthermore in relation to authority to enter into transactions it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties documentation in this regard Derivatives and Borrowings If we were to establish a company in India we would be subject to the Companies Act in relation to limitation on the quantum of monies which it could borrow Any borrowing in excess of stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the company in general meeting Accordingly in relation to derivatives transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency one would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by the members of the company in general meeting The power to borrow itself must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors Collateral It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided received for example in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India would be legal valid and binding as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its insolvency however the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance The due diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due diligence consider outright transfers of collateral eg under English law rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral situated locally in India these issues need to be checked Choice of Law and Arbitration It would appear that Indian entities may enter into agreements eg ISDA Masters governed by New York or US law and it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work Insurance business Indian counsel opined that interest rateFX derivative transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India Income Tax Please note that if an Enron entity or a branch of an Enron entity was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake such business then any income arising to the Enron entity branch in India from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax Please note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA UK and Singapore with India However no details of rates of taxation or further explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in the opinion GrossUp Clauses Contractual grossup clauses re withholdings eg the standard grossup clause in the ISDA Master would need to be approved by the RBI Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved Closeout netting Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel the existing due diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum eg if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a closeout against them in their insolvency This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel Oral Contracts Please note that in relation to oral contracts whilst it is possible to sue upon an oral contract in India it is not possible to take any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the permission of the RBI under section of FERA Indian counsel does not state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to obtain Mark I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above before I take any further action on the above Kind regards Mark Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a
