no cause for alarm or better said av ailable remedy from the creditorequity side whether our credit is BBB or BBB why should it matter that we assign to an entity that is BBB Tod a greed to that this

RE Amendment to IM II PPA I spoke to Mike and he had stated that he is in agreement with you on the B anking Provisions and their original intent We also agree that if we assi gn the PPA to an affiliate the Enron Corp guarantee will follow So you have two remaining points to address which can be managed outside of EPMI i The right to assign to a BBB or above Joe has read the DASH whic h also indicates a BBB assignment provision I think this is something th at the lenders should be able to price for you ii The curtailment issue which is a buyer AEP issue which should be solved by them managing this risk through curtailment credits or some othe r means through their portfolio as mentioned by Tod in our meeting We obviously can price these if necessary as indicated by Kevin in his prev ious note to ensure you are making the right decision The contract is wor th around mm today Joe has been working with the finance guys on Indian Mesa II and should be able to offer some assistance but unless the economics state we should cha nge the EPMI contract as the pricing from the lenders and AEP is greater th an Kevins I think we are done Let me know if not Louise Original Message From Lindholm Tod A Sent Monday September PM To Presto Kevin M Curry Mike Lamb John Payne Michael Cc Murphy Harlan Kitchen Louise Subject RE Amendment to IM II PPA Kevin xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomof ficeoffice EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi nanced and sold All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit y purchaser have been dropped and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu ction I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t o the deal Banking Provisions EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en ergy credits RECS produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would on a cumulat ive basis offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years Section of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties This section origina lly provided for the carryover but in an effort to simplify the language the aggregate carryover concept was clouded Both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o f the carryover banking provisions EPMIs most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI drafted the contract with specific pro visions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment Section There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere d under the termination provision relating to force majeure under Section This inconsistency is the problem Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment The propos ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of t he PPA be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments This clarification is consistent wi th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal EPMI Credit Support EPMIs obligations under the PPA are guaranteed by Enron The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain affiliates without consent of the seller Any assignment by EPMI would n ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract and the Enr on guarantee would remain in place However the project lenders have requ ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as Enron Corps credit quality The project lenders have also requested t hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corps since that i s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA This will not affe ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga tion unless released by the project Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu e declaratory relief under arbitration Our sense is that this does nothin g but ensure delay From an Enron perspective The sale of the equity and the financing of the nonrecourse debt on the Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surro unding the ambiguities in the PPA While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place different offtaker the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale o f the Indian Mesa II project If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month Enron will likely end up with approximately M less cas h at year end than it counted on in its plan in addition to any decrease i n planned earnings The aftertax return to Enron in a hold situation is due to Enro n being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position ie it cannot use the tax benefits It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla rifications would have had no affect on value Tod Original Message From Presto Kevin M Sent Saturday September PM To Curry Mike Lamb John Payne Michael Lindholm Tod A Cc Murphy Harlan Kitchen Louise Subject RE Amendment to IM II PPA I would like to make the message even more clear EPMI will not be making any changes amendments clarifications interpretations
