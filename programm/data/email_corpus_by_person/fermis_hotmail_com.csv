he s a basis trader form jaron whos scaling everst weve been getting weekly update that were all pretty honkydory till this one this email was sent fom meters yesterday Original Message From Donald Tencellent Jr Sent Thursday May AM To Trevor Vaughan Subject FW spoke too soon From Nagle RitaSMTP Sent Thursday May AM To Donald Tencellent Jr Subject FW spoke too soon Original Message From himex mailto Sent Thursday May AM To outhstreamcom Subject spoke too soon Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes quickly at meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and had i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends ensuring his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge now dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but stare into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives A member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp this morning Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i think of this mountain now i think only of death Russ is quite experienced in higaltitude rescues but this is the first time he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly strong Many stories of heroism over last hours and many to come The guide and the client spent the night on the ridge meters incoherent and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second time in hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes reaching top camp metersstill incredibly dangerous at pm It was a relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen moving space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could not stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above meters are epics and you are sure to read about this Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available bodies and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba and Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace and the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is inches across for stretches dropping feet on either side When i gazed down nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there for over hours now have been gathering oxygen for the meter descent to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a doublerescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back by mem daywe have to get these people down The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower and slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh oh Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a burning building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is literally cut in half I am praying for these twoand the russiansand its hard to think f anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have messages from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its really sad I am sure they are also severely dehydratedill explain the process when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp was when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razorthin this whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a tenyearold knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here is that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line we used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the mountain And its so hard to do that Is a quarter tank enough Half Or do you need even more because in truth you are dying from the moment you leave camp not even top camp I will pass this info only when the word is outsorrybut will keep you updated from there once i talk ro russ Its hard watching friends die but were helpless down here Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at
