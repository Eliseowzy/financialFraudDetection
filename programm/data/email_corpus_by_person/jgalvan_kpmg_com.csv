answer your questions The assistance you and Steven will be giving by going through some contracts will be invaluable We have had several meetings lately with representatives from all sorts of Enron groups but have still not been able to at least minimally define a solid contract This is an absolute necessity for designing and building the validation and reconciliation tools It is actually Steve Watson not Scott That was my mistake He is a contact of ours in Toby Ellis group which is gathering power contracts and copying them for us on an ongoing basis including new business The process being followed for this detailed in the attached presentation We have not fully developed a plan for how to handle new business but such a decision is forthcoming As for the number of contracts I am not sure We of course have the paper copies delivered so far which equal lettersize boxes with about pages per each contract On top of that there are some contracts being copied at CSC totaling about full file drawers although we are not sure yet of the overlap of these with our already onhand copies Finally we do have extracts from the RPS and CSC Loadstar and STAT systems The CSC dump equaled about records which are summarized in the attached Excel spreadsheet The RPS dump equaled about records but no real analysis of the comprehensiveness of the data has been executed We are working with IT and business representatives to garner a more keen understanding of the fields themselves as well as determining what additional ones can be of use to us so as to formulate a final request for RPS data dump Rest assured that the work is being executed We currently have staff persons on hand already With the preparation of the Access DB for contract validation today alongside our already available set of contracts there will be plenty of data entry and validation work to do Please contact me if there are any other topics you wish to discuss I can be reached by any means as listed below kpmg LLP

communication last week to give you a status on our current activities for the Power Contract ValidationReconciliation Project The Access Database that will be used for the validation and reconciliation processes is complete Our estimate is about days for completion The main issue slowing the development process is that we are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete Power contract After doing so we will need to go back to the folks working with Scott Mills to do another RPS data extraction Toby Ellis group has been working to gather paper contracts from the Legal Dept CSC and Origination so that we have all of the sources necessary for validation and reconciliation As further contracts are generated andor located they are copied and on a daily basis we are to meet with Scott Watson midafternoon for ongoing collection Leveraging the experiences of the Gas Project we are currently documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will use to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures This should ensure a smooth transition for them I will look for Chris Murrays and your recommendations for these at some point by end of week We are currently ramping up the staff involved with this project By weekend we should have about staff personnel on board Finding a physical location for everyone will be difficult Murray ONeil Chris Stokley and one of the office managers in Allen are aware of this need and its urgency and are working with me to arrange the space Please let me know if you have any questions

Kristin Cc Wilson Randy D Fisher Steven Mills Scott Stokley Chris ONeil Murray P Subject RE Update Power Contract ValidationReconciliation Project KristinSteven Thanks for the reply To answer your questions The assistance you and Steven will be giving by going through some contracts will be invaluable We have had several meetings lately with representatives from all sorts of Enron groups but have still not been able to at least minimally define a solid contract This is an absolute necessity for designing and building the validation and reconciliation tools It is actually Steve Watson not Scott That was my mistake He is a contact of ours in Toby Ellis group which is gathering power contracts and copying them for us on an ongoing basis including new business The process being followed for this detailed in the attached presentation We have not fully developed a plan for how to handle new business but such a decision is forthcoming As for the number of contracts I am not sure We of course have the paper copies delivered so far which equal lettersize boxes with about pages per each contract On top of that there are some contracts being copied at CSC totaling about full file drawers although we are not sure yet of the overlap of these with our already onhand copies Finally we do have extracts from the RPS and CSC Loadstar and STAT systems The CSC dump equaled about records which are summarized in the attached Excel spreadsheet The RPS dump equaled about records but no real analysis of the comprehensiveness of the data has been executed We are working with IT and business representatives to garner a more keen understanding of the fields themselves as well as determining what additional ones can be of use to us so as to formulate a final request for RPS data dump Rest assured that the work is being executed We currently have staff persons on hand already With the preparation of the Access DB for contract validation today alongside our already available set of contracts there will be plenty of data entry and validation work to do Please contact me if there are any other topics you wish to discuss I can be reached by any means as listed below kpmg LLP
