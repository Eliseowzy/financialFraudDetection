the article on Louise Kitchen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS Patient but Not Passive A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswome n She is strong and resolute but not in a hurry Patricia Sellers Mon Oct EDT For some yearsever since women started jockeying for power in the wor kplacepatience has gotten a bad rap After all the virtue fairly reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife an d mother So women have shunned it Instead they have felt the need to mak e bold pronouncements and rush to action That was never truer than during the season of dotcom mania when every CEO professed to be leading a rev olution And any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get tram pled by the capitalist vanguard Now in these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Busine ss we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly Were not talk ing about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat pass ively in an outoftheway corner Rather they stayed with a company ste adily building influence there and rose to power through determination an d insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion These qualities of course serve men as well as women Jim Collins author of Good to Great argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such col orless men as Darwin Smith at KimberlyClark and William Allen at Boeing Through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation personal humil ity and will they created enduring greatness Its too early to say whet her Anne Mulcahy No on our list can pull off such a feat But she fit s the profile An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO she f elt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July Im not as famous as Carlyand I want to keep it that way says Mulcahy The famous CarlyHewlettPackard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorinais st ill No on our list as she has been every year since we began publishin g the The Power in She still heads the biggest company bil lion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy competitor Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In di fficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As a womanand a daring outspoken one at thather actions ar e scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men Says Fiorina Iv e had a lot of male CEOs say to me Thank God they dont rank us PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi No understands the urge to tak e bold action but she also knows the necessity of holding back There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher leve lwhich is why women tend to push themselves harder than men says Nooyi But we have to have the right people around who can say to us You re draining the organization Youre pushing too hard Particularly no w as the US prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn power seems to call for pragmatic and c areful leadership This years Power is full of such steady leaders Mulcahy Nooyi and t he other corporate women who are new to the top ten this yearMirants Ma rce Fuller No Pfizers Karen Katen No Chevrons Pat Woertz No and Krafts Betsy Holden No are all lowprofile loyalists The combined tenure at their current companies years The six years Andr ea Jung No spent as head of marketing at Avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became CEO two years ago see It Took a Lady to Save Avon As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at the startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever eBays Meg Whitman No on our list Wh itman who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough has ne ver overpromised investors instead she has diligently delivered abovetar get profits every single quarter While the economy and its points of power change the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list She owns a product The Oprah Winfrey Show that generates more than mil lion in annual revenues and reaches million viewers in the US each we ekplus millions more in international markets Her show and now her magazine O The Oprah Magazine whose subject is personal empowerment have immense influence on the popular culturefrom what books people read to what kind of lives they lead The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers and three returnees from previous years But one trend is especially intriguing Wo men are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibil ity for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot o n this list No more Unless she wields media power like Martha Stewart No This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more Thats a first The ranking has become so competitive in fact that some women moved down even though their power increased Example Shelly Lazarus She heads a healthy busin ess ad giant Ogilvy Mather where by the way she has worked for ye ars whose revenues grew last year Plus she added a prestigious boa rd seatGeneral Electricto her resume But in order to make room for ne wcomers Lazarus slides to No from No last year One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett No Loy alty and selfknowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never imagin ed while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls Vt Barrett couldnt afford to go to a fouryear college and had no specific ambition beyond believing s he would be the best legal secretary in the world she says Barrett sta rted as Herb Kellehers secretary in a decade before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines She made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be Americas topperforming airline In her job as exe cutive vice president of customers she helped create Southwests famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to Kell ehers grand vision Ive never wanted the CEO job says Barrett I don t think I have the talents for it Im a great No person Now Bar rett is exactly where she wants to be Loyalty does not mean kowtowing The women on our list push their companie s to change and grow and they take personal risks Women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller She should know Fuller was getting great marks running international project development for Mirants former parent Southern in when her boss asked her to take charge of the companys tiny North American power plant operations After looking closely at the business sh e told her boss she didnt want the job unless she could do something alto gether newbuild a hightech riskmanagement and marketing organization t o complement the expansion of power plants in the US I told him If yo u dont have this piece you dont have a game plan she says It wasn t an easy sell Only at the time Fuller lobbied Southerns board for a pproval Once she got it she built a person energy trading and market ing unit that is expected to generate billion in revenues this year S outhern a regulated utility spun off Mirant last spring So now Fuller i s her own bossand with Mirant sure to be among Americas largest compan ies this year a FORTUNE CEO One of the few The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of FOR TUNE companies including Fuller And there are fewer women in the pip eline than anyone would have thought years ago When I was I was e xpecting that by this point wed be in the fiftyfifty range says Betsy Bernard No CEO of ATConsumer The reality though disappointing h as motivated Bernard to become a catalyst making sure that other women g et opportunities Bernard and other women emerging now are not based on the old modelthe sharklike Linda Wachner whose company Warnaco c rashed into bankruptcy this year Or the flamboyant Jill

<8811189.1075858591872.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,janette.elbertson@enron.com,2001-10-02 16:55:42,Patient but Not PassiveA colleague has sent you this article from Fortune Reply to your colleague at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS Patient but Not Passive A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswome n She is strong and resolute but not in a hurry Patricia Sellers Mon Oct EDT For some yearsever since women started jockeying for power in the wor kplacepatience has gotten a bad rap After all the virtue fairly reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife an d mother So women have shunned it Instead they have felt the need to mak e bold pronouncements and rush to action That was never truer than during the season of dotcom mania when every CEO professed to be leading a rev olution And any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get tram pled by the capitalist vanguard Now in these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Busine ss we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly Were not talk ing about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat pass ively in an outoftheway corner Rather they stayed with a company ste adily building influence there and rose to power through determination an d insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion These qualities of course serve men as well as women Jim Collins author of Good to Great argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such col orless men as Darwin Smith at KimberlyClark and William Allen at Boeing Through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation personal humil ity and will they created enduring greatness Its too early to say whet her Anne Mulcahy No on our list can pull off such a feat But she fit s the profile An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO she f elt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July Im not as famous as Carlyand I want to keep it that way says Mulcahy The famous CarlyHewlettPackard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorinais st ill No on our list as she has been every year since we began publishin g the The Power in She still heads the biggest company bil lion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy competitor Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In di fficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As a womanand a daring outspoken one at thather actions ar e scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men Says Fiorina Iv e had a lot of male CEOs say to me Thank God they dont rank us PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi No understands the urge to tak e bold action but she also knows the necessity of holding back There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher leve lwhich is why women tend to push themselves harder than men says Nooyi But we have to have the right people around who can say to us You re draining the organization Youre pushing too hard Particularly no w as the US prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn power seems to call for pragmatic and c areful leadership This years Power is full of such steady leaders Mulcahy Nooyi and t he other corporate women who are new to the top ten this yearMirants Ma rce Fuller No Pfizers Karen Katen No Chevrons Pat Woertz No and Krafts Betsy Holden No are all lowprofile loyalists The combined tenure at their current companies years The six years Andr ea Jung No spent as head of marketing at Avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became CEO two years ago see It Took a Lady to Save Avon As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at the startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever eBays Meg Whitman No on our list Wh itman who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough has ne ver overpromised investors instead she has diligently delivered abovetar get profits every single quarter While the economy and its points of power change the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list She owns a product The Oprah Winfrey Show that generates more than mil lion in annual revenues and reaches million viewers in the US each we ekplus millions more in international markets Her show and now her magazine O The Oprah Magazine whose subject is personal empowerment have immense influence on the popular culturefrom what books people read to what kind of lives they lead The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers and three returnees from previous years But one trend is especially intriguing Wo men are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibil ity for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot o n this list No more Unless she wields media power like Martha Stewart No This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more Thats a first The ranking has become so competitive in fact that some women moved down even though their power increased Example Shelly Lazarus She heads a healthy busin ess ad giant Ogilvy Mather where by the way she has worked for ye ars whose revenues grew last year Plus she added a prestigious boa rd seatGeneral Electricto her resume But in order to make room for ne wcomers Lazarus slides to No from No last year One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett No Loy alty and selfknowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never imagin ed while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls Vt Barrett couldnt afford to go to a fouryear college and had no specific ambition beyond believing s he would be the best legal secretary in the world she says Barrett sta rted as Herb Kellehers secretary in a decade before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines She made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be Americas topperforming airline In her job as exe cutive vice president of customers she helped create Southwests famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to Kell ehers grand vision Ive never wanted the CEO job says Barrett I don t think I have the talents for it Im a great No person Now Bar rett is exactly where she wants to be Loyalty does not mean kowtowing The women on our list push their companie s to change and grow and they take personal risks Women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller She should know Fuller was getting great marks running international project development for Mirants former parent Southern in when her boss asked her to take charge of the companys tiny North American power plant operations After looking closely at the business sh e told her boss she didnt want the job unless she could do something alto gether newbuild a hightech riskmanagement and marketing organization t o complement the expansion of power plants in the US I told him If yo u dont have this piece you dont have a game plan she says It wasn t an easy sell Only at the time Fuller lobbied Southerns board for a pproval Once she got it she built a person energy trading and market ing unit that is expected to generate billion in revenues this year S outhern a regulated utility spun off Mirant last spring So now Fuller i s her own bossand with Mirant sure to be among Americas largest compan ies this year a FORTUNE CEO One of the few The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of FOR TUNE companies including Fuller And there are fewer women in the pip eline than anyone would have thought years ago When I was I was e xpecting that by this point wed be in the fiftyfifty range says Betsy Bernard No CEO of ATConsumer The reality though disappointing h as motivated Bernard to become a catalyst making sure that other women g et opportunities Bernard and other women emerging now are not based on the old modelthe sharklike Linda Wachner whose company Warnaco c rashed into bankruptcy this year Or the flamboyant Jill Barad who was bo oted from Mattel last year Says PepsiCos Indra Nooyi PepsiCo which us ed to be known for hiring Pepsi prettyblond blueeyed maleshas made an Indian woman its president That says a lot about the future of women Lets hope Nooyi is right Meantime if you dont see a new Wonder Woman in corporate America it doesnt mean she doesnt exist She might be qui etly and diligently doing her job
