Remove Substitute or Add an email address to our list please send bri ef message to Pepco to Supply Electricity in Maryland Beginning in July of this year Pepco Energy Services will provide electri city to sixteen Maryland state agencies The contract is worth nearly million for billion kilowatthours to be provided over a two year per iod Six percent of the total electricity supply will be generated from re newable resources This award from the State of Maryland is the latest of million worth of contracts for Pepcos services awarded within the la st two years New Mexico Passes Electric Energy Policy On January th the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission NMPRC passed a resolution adopting a new electric energy policy for the state despite the fact that the New Mexico legislature had earlier postponed deregulati on until Principles of the NMPRC policy include requiring utilities to operate adequate distribution infrastructure requesting an indepth an alysis of New Mexicos transmission system redesigning retail rates and considering alternative forms of regulation Commission staff noted that without legislative intervention to repeal the restructuring act the comm issions energy principles can be implemented only on a temporary basis Seven New Power Plants for New Mexico Five power companies serving customers in New Mexico have committed to bui ld seven new power plants in the state between now and the inception of d eregulation These seven plants are expected to generate MW of new e lectricity supply The power companies include Duke Energy Public Service Company of New Mexico TriState Generation and Transmission Peabody Ener gy and Cobisa Corporation all of which have begun construction or are st ill in the planning stages Exelon CEO Supports Continued Deregulation Efforts Speaking at an energy conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago E xelon coCEO John Rowe said that the nation cannot return to the failed re gulatory structures of the past Referring to Enrons bankruptcy and Calif ornias energy crisis Rowe noted that The grand experiment has had some fairly substantial hiccups but we cant go back to our grandfathers Ol dsmobile He also urged FERC to establish RTOs and disagreed with the age ncys November decision to give up price setting responsibility for three large US utilities Deregulation ad campaign denounced The Ontario government will launch a million series of television ads to publicize the arrival of competition in the electricity market but th e opposition denounces the campaign as propaganda This isnt about pub lic information this is about brainwashing NDP Leader Howard Hampton sa id yesterday Its just fundamentally wrong Mr Hampton said advertisin g industry sources told him the government was planning five different tel evision spots to announce that private companies will be allowed to sell e lectricity to consumers starting May The government responded that only one ad was produced as part of a broader campaign to educate consumers a bout their choices under the new system The brief piece resembles many of the other ads produced by the Progressive Conservative government some o f which have been criticized for trying to bolster public support for cont roversial policies Softfocus pictures of smiling people in everyday sett ings run underneath a voice track explaining why deregulation of Ontarios electricity is necessary As we grow were going to need more electrici ty says the advertisements voiceover And more companies generating e lectricity Were not trying to sell privatization said Mike Krizanc a spokesman for the Ministry of Energy Science and Technology He noted t hat the ads are part of an education campaign for which the government has handed out almost a million eightpage pamphlets about changes to the ele ctricity system Ministry officials are also holding public meetings around the province particularly with seniors who might be confused about their new choices This is a propaganda campaign to try to turn around p ublic opinion Mr Hampton said New Requirements for ESCOs in New York The New York State Public Service Commission has approved new financial re quirements for energy service companies or ESCOs ESCOs doing business in New York will now have to meet a minimum bond rating from an independent rating agency before offering prepayment plans or requiring security depos its ESCOs that do not earn the minimum rating will have to put security d eposits in escrow or issue an irrevocable letter of credit they will not be allowed to offer prepayment plans PSC Chairwoman Maureen Helmer explai ned last week that the additional consumer protections balance key inter ests in the energy markets Specifically our administrative flexibility e nables us to balance vital consumer interests with the interest in offerin g innovative competitive energy services Problems in Texas Leave Customers Without Electricity Recent reports of pitfalls in Texas newly deregulated electricity market note that some customers are being left without electricity for several da ys Reportedly deregulation is complicating the way that orders for new e lectricity service are placed and processed in that consumers may select from a number of retail electricity providers REPs when they decide to o rder new service or switch to a different provider After being notified b y a customer the provider must contact ERCOT the Electric Reliability Co uncil of Texas ERCOT which is responsible for managing the power grid t hen notifies the current utility that its customer has opted to change ser vice Before January only the regulated utility needed to be cont acted now there are three different entities involved with the change The usual wait for a service change had been to hours Now it typicall y takes two to five days The Houston Chronicle is reporting that one Hous ton family endured days without electricity while waiting for power in their new apartment Tom Noel ERCOTs president and chief executive offic er explained that weve traded off reduced rates for a little less conve nience In other words in the past when there was a monopoly utility in t his city they consumers made one phone call and that was the only part y they needed to call This issue had impacted enough consumers to cause the states Public Utility Commission to place it on the agenda at last we eks open meeting Terry Hadley a spokesman for the Austinbased commissi on said that the delays are of concern to the commission and that it is l ooking to improve the process Cost of Ontario Hydro subsidies revealed Fearful that competition would lead to sharply higher electricity prices a group of Ontario industrial companies persuaded the province to give the m a subsidy extension worth up to million Records on the size of the subsidy were obtained by Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail through the freedomofinformation legislation It is the first time the amount of the price break given by the Progressive Conservative government has been made public The records also indicate that the Ministry of Energy viewed major electricityconsuming companies as hypocrites because they publicl y called for powermarket competition while privately demanding a continua tion of the subsidy that allows them to buy electricity at belowmarket pr ices Big companies such as Dofasco Inc Bowater Pulp and Paper Canada I nc and up to other large electricity users will continue to receive the subsidy when the Ontario electricity market opens for competition on M ay The extension could last for up to four years Subsidized power was first offered by Ontario Hydro in when the company was looking for w ays to increase demand through what were termed special rate deals Sinc e then about per cent of Ontarios electricity has been covered by thes e deals which were supposed to end when the electricity market was opened to competition Companies receiving the subsidies would suddenly face pri ce increases of up to per cent the records say The cost of the subsid ies will be carried by Ontario Power Generation one of Ontario Hydros su ccessor companies and Ontario Electricity Financial Corp the body payin g off Ontario Hydros debts according to the records The documents show that senior executives at big companies began pressuring Premier Mike Harr is former finance minister Ernie Eves and Energy Minister Jim Wilson in threatening that if the government didnt continue the subsidy the companys investments in the province would be at risk In June of ca binet approved continuing the subsidies through regulation despite an ass essment by the Ministry of Energy that said Ontario Power Generation could lose up to million over four years compared with selling the electr icity at market prices Ontario Electricity Financial Corp would receive million less in dividends over that period Price to Beat Set in Virginia The Virginia State Corporation Commission announced this week that a pric e to beat electricity rate has been set as a benchmark for cost compariso n in the states developing deregulated electricity market The rate will be reset on a yearly basis Electricity suppliers wishing to compete in th e market must offer service at a lower rate or provide a unique service su ch as a green power package The actual price to compare for a particular customer will vary depending on usage and the rate schedule of the existin g electric company but the average price to compare is cents per kilo watthour for residential customers During the states pilot customer cho ice program some Virginia Power customers chose to switch to Dominion whi ch charges between cents and cents per kilowatthour for electri city At the time of the pilot these rates were competitive with rates of fered by other utilities serving customers in Virginia The SCC is now cau tioning those customers to reconsider their switch based on the new price to beat rate A spokesman from Dominion said last week that the company h as no immediate plans to lower its rates but is pleased that new rates ha ve been announced stating We have a number we can shoot at We welcome it Customers who switch their electricity supplier in the new market mus t also consider the transition charge they must pay for the next years This charge was created to compensate utilities for losses on investments they made previously to serve those customers Two licensed competitors Old Mill Power Company and AES New Energy Incorporated have requested tha t the charge be phased out Some concern has been expressed that the low b enchmark price makes it difficult for new retail electricity suppliers to enter the market Eric Matheson AES New Energys director of new markets is arguing that the low price makes it impossible for his company to co mpete with incumbent utilities in Virginia Efforts to Deregulate Electricity Will Be Slowed A top DOE official told reporters this week that efforts to deregulate the electricity market in the United States will be slowed for years due to t he collapse of Enron Corporation and the welldocumented energy crisis in California Vicky Bailey Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Domestic Policy said that the ramifications of Californias crisis and the fall of Enron could slow the progress of electricity deregulation for two to three years She does not expect this to end further developments in deregulation throughout the country however Bailey a former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member believes that Enrons absence may hur t the industrys push toward deregulation but competition will ultimately prevail The restructuring issue she added is larger than Enron and too much progress has been made in support of restructuring to go back to reg ulated markets Long Island Opens to Retail Competition The Long Island Power Authority LIPA has announced that is has completel y opened the islands electricity market to retail competition under the L IChoice Program This achievement is seven years ahead of the schedule im posed by the Public Authorities Control Board PACB in May and a yea r in advance of LIPAs own deadline Under LIPAs retail competition program three Energy Services Companies ESCOs have been certified to s upply electricity to residential and commercial customers on Long Island Currently residential and commercial customers receive approximat ely MW of electricity from ConEd Solutions NIMO Energy Marketing or KeySpan Energy Solutions LIPA has invited the Suffolk County Electrical Agency SCEA to formally participate in the customer choice program as w ell and hopes it will sell as much electricity as it can obtain under its ESCO provisions LIPA Chairman Richard M Kessel hopes that these efforts will encourage more ESCOs to join the market LIPA has also increased the Energy Bill Credit or shopping credit from cents per kilowatthour to cents per kilowatthour to further encourage competition within the market This credit is equal to the cost of generationrelated energy an d capacity costs that LIPA avoids when an ESCO takes over provision of ele ctric service The funds derived from the credit are returned to the ESCO to help cover its generation costs It is hoped that the increase will p rovide ESCOs with a greater incentive to supply competitively priced elect ricity to consumers Retail deregulation in the state began in May w hen LIPA first reduced electric rates by an average of resulting in s avings of billion LIChoice began its phasedin approach to deregula tion in April followed by a second phase in May Florida Loses Interest In Deregulation Interest in a deregulated electricity marketplace in Florida has waned con siderably over the past few months Despite the findings of the Florida E nergy Study Commissions December report that recommended initiation of a competitive wholesale market little additional discussion has occurr ed and the state Legislature is not expected to act on the recommendation s in the report The Orlando Sentinel reported last week that the Legisla ture has other more critical issues on its agenda including the recessio n reapportionment and the states response to terrorism Sanford Berg a Commission member who directs the Public Utilities Research Center at the University of Florida explained that the Legislature is preoccupie d as well with congressional redistricting and the states budget crisis He also mentioned that the Energy Commissions report will require substa ntial analysis which the Legislature does not have time to do The bankru ptcy of Enron Corporation has also contributed to a lack of interest in de regulation The companys collapse has caused stakeholders in Florida to question the ability of electricity generators and transmission and distri bution companies to supply uninterrupted flows of power at an affordable p rice Despite the lack of deregulation in Florida the electricity market in the state appears to be stable and healthy The states large power c ompanies are consistently profitable and have been able to adjust customer prices as compensation for investments in new generating plants and fluct uations in fuel costs The utilities do not expect wide variations in fue l costs in the coming year and believe they have sufficient generating cap acity to cover the demand for power Creation of a regional transmission organization RTO to serve the state is not planned regardless of collab orative efforts during to form a statewide RTO Grid Florida This p lan has been stalled due to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions pre ference for interstate RTOs North Carolina Study Commission To Resume The Study Commission on the Future of Electric Service in North Carolina w ill resume on February Deliberations on electric deregulation ar e not expected to take center stage rather the Commissions work to reso lve the debt burden of several towns and cities will likely be the focus o f discussion In April the Commission approved a set of recommendat ions that included moving to a feemarket system for all power sales in th e state by Californias energy crisis however resulted in the Com missions design to delay these plans Commission CoChairman Senator Dav id Hoyle DGaston told reporters this week that the he does not expect t he panel to make any major recommendations before legislators convene May th for the session He also noted that the Commission is expecting updates from other states on their electricity deregulation activities an d plans in addition to a report on available power supplies for the state s million electric customers Senator Kay Hagan DGuilford agrees wi th Senator Hoyle and does not expect the Commission to move forward with d eregulation plans This is so complex that its not easy to even figure out what questions to ask she said North Carolina regulators are expect ed to closely follow electricity restructuring in the neighboring state of Virginia Pennsylvania Utility Denies Market Manipulation PPL Corporation headquartered in Allentown Pennsylvania has denied char ges that it set artificially high prices for wholesale products in its ser vice territory The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC is inves tigating PPL in the aftermath of charges leveled at it from PJM Interconne ction LLC the wholesale market operator and NewPower Holdings Incorporat ed PPL claims that a readily foreseeable increase in demand resulted i n price increases during the first quarter of rather than an effort t o control prices The PUC is interested in the case because these price c ontrol charges pose questions about the success of the states deregulated electricity market PJM required that electric companies under its juris diction have the ability to meet of their expected demand Therefore PPLs high prices have a negative effect on competing electric companies which often purchase supplemental generating capacity from the utility NewPower which serves Pennsylvania customers called last years market prices unjust and unreasonable Other electric companies and co nsumer advocates are following the case closely to judge its potential con sequences for the future of electric competition John Hanger a former P UC commissioner and now head of PennFuture a Harrisburg consumer interest group said that nobody believes that there wasnt market manipulation g oing on PPL contests in its filing to the PUC that the price increases did not prevent alternative electricity suppliers from competing at the re tail level nor did they affect consumers negatively Most consumers in the midAtlantic region are protected from price fluctuations by rate caps so they did not directly feel the effects of higher wholesale prices Hanger maintained that retail suppliers began leaving the market following the h igh prices in March of The PUC confirmed that only of the origin al electric companies operating in the MidAtlantic region last January are still in the market Copyright Egnatia Research Management All rights reserved

Substitute or Add an email address to our list please send bri ef message to Enrons Collapse Has Experts Questioning Future of Electric Deregulation The collapse of energy company Enron has several experts questioning its i mpacts on the future of electric deregulation Analysts say that the compa nys public championing of electric deregulation in Florida and its curren t financial situation might signal caution to state regulators Enron was the most visible and ardent cheerleader of deregulation and I think what s happened to them is going to raise all these questions about deregulati on says Jim Owen spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute Another v iew comes from Steven Weiss of the Center of Responsive Politics in Washin gton who says that politicians may step away from deregulation because th ey view Enron like a rotten egg Other insiders believe that Enrons sit uation may be another reason that Floridas Governor Jeb Bush has postponed any movement toward deregulation until after his reelection campaig n Jon Cartwright a senior energy analyst with Raymond James Associates says that it will be difficult for deregulation plans to be completely h alted but Enron is going to give regulators something to think about in a ddition to Californias problems with deregulation Retail Choice Available in Massachusetts Dominion Retail Inc has become the first residential supplier to enter Ma ssachusetts nearmoribund competitive retail electricity market Until no w no companies have attempted to enter the states retail marketplace Ro b Wilson a spokesman from Massachusetts Division of Telecommunications an d Energy said that low electric rates have made the market unattractive f or new power providers He also said suppliers were deterred by the nature of the defaultstandardoffer system that tends to spread potential custo mers in the default group over a broad area Dominion will offer an altern ative choice of power supply to Massachusetts Electrics residenti al customers who are now receiving their power on default service Default customers can receive their power from Dominion at per month if th ey commit to a threeyear deal which is slightly less than the ave rage cost for Massachusetts Electric default customers However it is sti ll more than the proposed per month that an average Massachusetts E lectric standardoffer customer will pay beginning January pendin g state approval Currently there are already several companies competing for commercial and industrial customers in the states electric marketplac e Consumer Choice Drives Green Power Market A new study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL and the L awrence Berkeley National Labs Environmental Energy Technology Division h as found that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy so urces If consumers are given the choice they will choose power from clea ner sources such as wind solar geothermal and biomass The study says t hat in order for green power to gain full support in the marketplace rest ructuring should proceed without delay and that market rules in restructur ed markets should be conducive to competition Our study shows that givin g consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving r enewable energy into the marketplace says Blair Swezey of NREL coauthor of the study entitled Forecasting the Growth of Green Power Markets in t he United States Under the best conditions use of green power could gro w percent in less than a decade to a capacity of megawatts Howe ver the study concludes that it is more likely that renewables will exper ience a slow growth in the market In addition to a competitive marketplac e vigorous promotion and education will also be necessary to ensure the s uccess of green power Electricity Bill Will Be Put Off Until Next Year The House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee is preparing an electricity bill that will focus on increasing power supplies and improving electricit y transmission from one part of the country to another Subcommittee Chair man Joe Barton RTX has not set a date for markup an aide said but aims to consider the bill during the first two weeks of December Accordingly Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin RLa announced at a news conference yesterday that he expects to receive the bill for consid eration by the years end Chairman Tauzin told reporters that Congress sh ould allow states to make their own decisions regarding siting transmissio n facilities within their boundaries but that interstate projects might r equire Federal intervention He also noted that grid connections among sta tes are necessary for regional transmission organizations as a means to ex pand the grid and eliminate electricity bottlenecks Separately Senate Ma jority Leader Tom Daschle DSD is expected to introduce a Senate energy bill that includes an electricity title but said that the Senate will not consider it until next year FERC Underestimated Environmental Impacts of Competition The final environmental impact statement the Federal Energy Regulatory Com mission FERC completed for Order underestimated the effects that a c ompetitive wholesale power market would have on air pollutants a new stud y says Synapse Energy Economics a Massachusettsbased firm prepared the study for the commission It reviewed the accuracy of FERCs predictions o n the effects competition would have on the environment in the year The most important conclusion from the analysis is that FERCs modeling me thodology was too narrowly defined to capture the effects the report says Synapse found that FERC did not fully consider the impacts from increase s in electricity demand improvements in nuclear plant efficiency and the extension of nuclear and coal plant lifetimes The study concludes that F ERCs forecast of NOx emissions was roughly four percent lower than actual experience and its forecast of CO emissions was roughly eight percent lo wer Also the report finds that FERC underestimated actual national elect ricity demand through by percent The North American Commission f or Environmental Cooperation a panel created under the North American Fre e Trade Agreement was expected to address these findings and other enviro nmental concerns among the United States Canada and Mexico at a forum he ld November in San Diego Michigan PSC Protects Consumers from Retail Slamming The Michigan Public Service Commission MPSC has adopted standards to pro tect retail electric consumers from slamming and cramming Slamming is the unauthorized switching from one electric customer from electric service p rovider to another while cramming is the billing of a customer for unauth orized electric services The Customer Choice and Reliability Act of requires that the Commission issue orders to protect Michigans electric c ustomers from slamming and cramming and authorizes the Commission to condu ct contested proceedings to investigate any violations Under the new meas ures customers may authorize switching of their electric service provider through written authorization a call to a tollfree telephone number voic e response unit a Webbased connection notice to an appropriately qualif ied third party or a threeway call between the new supplier the custome r and the older supplier New suppliers must notify customers and the exi sting provider within seven days of the requested change in service Viola tors can be fined up to for the first offense up to for t he second offense and up to for repeated violations Michigan PSC Approves Commonwealth Energy as Alternative Supplier The Michigan Public Service Commission MPSC has approved Commonwealth En ergy Corporations application to sell electric generation to Michigan ret ail customers The commission approved Commonwealths license to be the th alternative electric supplier in the state under the Customer Choice an d Electricity Reliability Act of The state regulators concluded that approval of the alternative electric supplier license would expand the op portunities for retail electric competition in the state The commission g ranted the license conditioned upon Commonwealth providing electric servic e within a reasonable time and indicated that failure to do so may result in revocation of the license Commonwealth will operate in Michigan under t he name ElectricAmerica Hearing Held on Pennsylvanias Electric Deregulation The Pennsylvania House Democratic Policy Committee held a hearing on elect ric deregulation on November during which witnesses testified on the states future electricity needs and the impacts of deregulation The committee is concerned about whether enough power plants will be built to meet the states future demand Robert Hinkle of PJM Interconnection whi ch manages the midAtlantic transmission grid and serves as a wholesale el ectricity market said that megawatts of increased electricity capac ity are planned for the next three years With this increase the regions capacity would reach megawatts which is more than sufficient to m eet the regions electricity needs for the foreseeable future Hinkle said Richard Maurer of Local International Brotherhood of Electrical Work ers testified that deregulation has resulted in layoffs and more burdens o n an increasingly aging work force that his union represents On the other hand Duquesne Light Company President Victor Rogue told the committee th at Pennsylvanias electric deregulation has been a success Rogue said tha t Duquesne Light customers have been protected from steep rate increase an d can expect an estimated percent decline in the rates early next year Northeast May See Increased Power Costs Energy Security Analysis ESAI a Bostonbased consulting firm reports t hat urban areas in the Northeast may experience increased power prices unl ess investments are made in regional power generation and transmission sys tems ESAI director Ed Krapels said that while electricity restructuring resulted in new power plant construction in many states urban areas remai n at risk for higher prices ESAIs year power price forecast report fo r New England says that and are shaping up as years with premiu ms close to the double digits in both on and offpeak markets for the Ne w York Power Pool unless additional power and transmission are developed The report also concludes that Boston and southwestern Connecticut will re quire additional generation and transmission to keep their urban premiums in check The forecast estimates that premiums in the PJM region could i ncrease by per megawatt should no new generation be developed However new transmission projects will likely stimulate the development of the n ew generation projects that are currently stalled New generation will hel p stabilize the New Jersey market as well as contribute to New York Citys power needs Ontario Power planning longterm debt offering in new year Ontario Power Generation is planning a longterm debt offering some time n ext year the company said yesterday We do intend to tap the longterm m arket for the first time next year Ronald Osborne president and chief e xecutive officer told reporters following an industry breakfast in Toront o Mr Osborne could not provide details on the proposed offering but sai d it would most likely be a longterm or possibly mediumterm issue This would be the first longterm debt offering for the company which was spu n off from debtridden Ontario Hydro in the s Mr Osborne said the pr oceeds from the offering would be used to replace old Ontario Hydro debt t hat has reached maturity By the middle of next year Ontario Power expect s to pay off million of debt Ontario Power is one of two main spinof fs of Ontario Hydro The other is Hydro Onewhich is slated to become a pu blicly traded company following the planned deregulation of the market nex t year Ontario Power is readying itself for the electricity market to ope n to competition next year The province has already pushed back its origi nal November deadline for electricitysystem deregulation by mon ths Rates Decrease For Texas Provider of Last Resort The Texas Public Utility Commission PUC and Assurance Energy have agreed to reduce previously announced rates for guaranteed backup electric serv ice in the Houston area and south Texas when retail competition begins on January Assurance Energy will be the provider of last resort POL R for residential and small nonresidential customers in these areas of T exas As a POLR Assurance is required to assure continued service at a fix ed nondiscountable rate to consumers who have been dropped by their curre nt electric provider The new prices will be cents per kilowatthour kWh for summer months and cents per kWh for nonsummer months compar ed to the previous respective prices of cents per kWh and cents p er kWh The previous agreement was negotiated early this year when the pri ce for natural gas a major fuel for generating electricity reached histo rical highs Currently natural gas prices are substantially lower Louisiana Considers a Limited Deregulation Plan The Louisiana Public Service Commission PSC is considering a limited ele ctricity deregulation plan that would allow large energy consumers to shop for competitive rates Under the plan companies that use five megawatts or more of energy would be allowed the option of leaving the regulated mar ket every two years starting in The proposed plan does not include r etail competition for residential or small business consumers Not all com missioners support the plan however Commissioner Don Owen has said that h e does not think deregulation will benefit electricity users in the state Opposition to the proposal has also come from the Louisiana Energy Users Group LEUG and the Louisiana Midcontinent Oil and Gas Association which maintain that large industrial users should be given the choice to leave the market annually The groups also argue that the plan hampers large ind ustrial customers from building cogeneration plants because of a provision that requires large industrial cogenerators to pay a stranded costs recov ery fee Industrial customers with new cogeneration facilities are allowed to apply for an exemption The PSC has not yet determined the stranded co st fee structure under the proposed deregulation plan David Dismukes an associate professor of energy studies at Louisiana State University says that this uncertainty may make companies hesitant to build cogeneration pl ants State regulators had included the fee in the proposed plan so that s tranded cost recovery would not be unfairly shifted to residential ratepay ers who remain in the regulated system The PSC is scheduled to vote on th e plan next month Deregulation in Mississippi Not Expected Soon In a recent speech to the Vicksburg Civic Club Public Service Commissione r Nielsen Cochran said it is unlikely that Mississippi will soon open its electricity market to competition Cochran explained that in order for co mpetition or deregulation to work there must be a greater abundance of ge neration options in the state After two years of hearings that ended in the Public Service Commission advised lawmakers that Mississippi was not ready for deregulation Cochran said that deregulation would result in more expensive electricity rates for consumers across the state Texas Electricity Provider Opposes Texas Deregulation Delay The New Power Company an electricity provider that is participating in Te xas pilot deregulation program said that it opposes delaying the January start of electricity deregulation New Power has been a major pl ayer in the pilot program but has experienced its share of obstacles alon g the way Computer glitches have caused the company to send out customer bills late and at times without appropriate charges Representatives from the company say that the company needs information from companies that ope rate the electricity transmission and metering systems in order to issue a ccurate bills New Power and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas whi ch is responsible for making the information available have been communic ating to improve the situation New Power is confident that its problems w ill be resolved in time for the January deregulation date The Pu blic Utility Commission requested comments from electricity companies on w hether the state should move the date back from January New California crisis Too much electricity A man approaches a woman in a grocerystore aisle and asks whether she wou ld rather have dinner with him tonight Sorry she replies shell be doin g her laundry late this evening And not tomorrow night either because s hell be doing her vacuuming in those offpeak hours Energy conservation you know Californians have been forced to watch this state government TV commercial over and over in recent months but are now rolling their eyes at its outdated message The Governor ordered the ads advocating radical energy conservation after an unprecedented wave of blackouts that plagued the state earlier this year But if ads were being ordered now they might suggest that Californians turn on extra lights plug in some heavy applia nces and run their air conditioners at full blast In only a few months C alifornia has gone from an energy drought to a flood in which the state i s now forced to sell or give away a glut of excess electricity at prices f ar below those it paid Californias doublewhammy energy crisis a shor tage followed by an overstock serves as a cautionary tale for other jur isdictions looking to privatize their utilities California led the way i n placing its electricity on the open market and last year fell prey to w hat some describe as a failure in its regulatory structure and what Gover nor Grey Davis calls a monumental scam committed by powergenerating com panies against the state One thing is certain When electricity demand was driven up by poor weather last January generators began charging the sta te prices hundreds of times more than what it had paid only months before Because California bought its power on a daybyday basis prices fluctua ted dramatically One generator billed the state US for a megaw att that had cost the previous year And because most of the states u tilities had capped domestic rates the price increase had to be borne by the state treasury Mr Davis now claims that the state is owed a refund o f more than billion from those generators Federal regulators agree wit h him although the amount of the refund still must be negotiated However the crisis left the state with debts in the tens of billions of dollars consumer electrical rates were raised by per cent and people were terr ified by days of rolling random blackouts that threatened to drive busine sses away from Californias already beleaguered economy Now Mr Davis is coming under fire for his solution to that crisis As the blackouts were t aking place he signed billion worth of longterm power contracts som e of them for many years at rates averaging a megawatt These seemed to provide stability but now they seem onerous With demand for oil and n atural gas dropping in the wake of Sept rosy weather forecasts and doz ens of new generating stations coming on line openmarket energy prices h ave dropped below a megawatt Suddenly California faces the prospect of paying tens of billions of dollars a year above market rates for electr icity Our children and grandchildren will be the ones who have to pay fo r his mistakes said Richard Riordan former mayor of Los Angeles and Mr Daviss chief Republican opponent To make matters worse those energyco nservation TV ads appear to have worked too well Californians are now usi ng less electricity per capita than any other state While this is applaud ed by utility officials and environmentalists it leaves California with c ontracts for far more electricity than it needs Energy companies which h ad rushed in to build or upgrade power plants during this years crisis h ave been scaling back dramatically Since September at least half a dozen planned generating stations have been cancelled But experts warn that th is too could backfire warning that California could be hit by another r ound of blackouts in five years Copyright Egnatia Research Management All rights reserved

House Energy and Commerce Committee have agreed with Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTexas that restructuring legislation should move forward now th at Congress has a few more weeks in session In an vote last week Rep ublican Committee members decided to continue drafting electricity restruc turing legislation Electricity restructuring provisions were excluded fro m the energy bill approved by

built for the competitive market The pro posed wind study will be the first commercial wind analysis executed solely for the competitive market Debate Over Deregulation Impacts in Oklahoma Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL has reported in a firstofits kind study that restructuring Oklahomas electric industry can benefit consume rs but problems and potential pitfalls do exist The report has been met with some opposition however Pete Churchwell president of Oklahomas sec ond largest electric utility AEPPSO stated on November th that he does not support the studys findings one of which indicates that Oklahomas e nergy costs could rise between and percent if the retail electricity market is opened to competition The study results indicate that lower ele ctric prices may be available in the short term but restructuring will ul timately bring higher prices Under the states restructuring plan existi ng generating plants will have a competitive advantage over new plants Th is advantage will result in higher prices in the long term because newer highercost plants may be forced out of the marketplace Churchwell contes ts that it is too early to know for certain how consumer rates will react in a deregulated market While admitting that the nations grid was not de signed for retail competition Churchwell said that improvements in state transmission systems would allow a successful retail competitive market Utility still looks to be freed of generators Clark Public Utilities has been trying in vain for two months to unload so me of the portable generators that have become a multimilliondollar wh ite elephant The units wired in rows near the River Road Generating Pla nt were leased for a year for million The deal was signed with Gen eral Electric early this year at a time when there were dire predictions about this summers power supply In addition to the equipment lease the re is a million natural gas contract to power the generators and a rou ghly million expense to transport the gas While Clark has been able to resell some of the gas at a loss the transportation costs cant be reco uped For weeks electricity on the open market has been much cheaper tha n that produced by the generators In place since July the generators e ach producing megawatt of power have run for just days Electricity prices have plunged from a high of per megawatthour this summer to less than today The price has to be about to make operating the g enerators feasible So utility officials have had no choice but to let the m sit idle In September the net expense for the generator farm gas gen erator lease and so on was million For no electricity Utility offi cials have tried to get GE to find customers for at least some of the gen erators Tuesday morning Andy Huck Clarks operations director said he had heard from GE about a pretty serious inquiry for two generators for two months And that he said is the best inquiry theyve had so far Now utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending a month for three GE employees and other expenses associated with maint aining the generators The theory is that the equipment should be tested a few at a time to ensure they will be ready if needed They told me t he generators need to be exercised said Huck I told them they spent two months on a ship without being started The units were built in Austr ia GE with a signed oneyear lease in hand has little incentive to fin d customers for the equipment particularly when the company could presuma bly lease other generators from its inventory They say its because we re such good client that an effort has been made to find other users for the generators said Huck Clarks million River Road generating plan t features a giant GE turbine Clark officials dont hold out much hope o f getting out from under the generator lease expense which runs about million per month Where would they go asked Jim Sanders Clarks dir ector of energy resources Meanwhile the natural gas supply for the equi pment is being resold at about half what it cost the utility Gas prices a lso have fallen since the supply deal was inked At their regular Tuesday meeting utility commissioners decided to proceed with a million bon d sale that includes money to pay for the generator lease In March Rick Dyer Clarks finance director recommended that the utility cut a deal f or a oneyear million bond anticipation note The arrangement was made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few months whi ch they have to levels The move Tuesday gave Dyer and utility Gener al Manager Wayne Nelson the OK to approve a bond sale of up to years at percent interest although percent or less is more likely and the goa l is a year term officials said The bond sale likely will occur in t he first week of December The bulk of the million borrowing is to cov er a million power purchase from Kaiser Aluminum The deal like the g enerator lease was for power to cover an AugustSeptember gap in Clarks power supply before the start of a Bonneville Power Administration contra ct That Kaiser purchase was at a megawatthour The utility lost a bid to have a federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a parti al refund AEP Reliant Named as Last Resort Providers in Texas The Texas Public Utility Commission PUC has named American Electric Powe r AEP and Reliant Resources affiliates providers of last resort POLR for residential and smallcommercial customers in all or part of count ies within TXU Electrics service area The POLR becomes the electricity p rovider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider due to payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s area AEP and Reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect January By becoming the POLR AEP and Reliant will acquire an additional milli on Dallasarea customers and an expected percent load increase Due t o the higher costs associated with such an increased load the PUC was agre eable to the higher rate Consumer groups are opposing the higher rates s aying that lowincome consumers will be unfairly hurt Although many lowi ncome consumers will qualify for a percent discount advocates are argui ng that POLR rates should equal the regular rates Studies Show Changing Consumer Views Towards Deregulation A recent study by Deloitte and Touche Energy Resources Group finds that co nsumers are less aware of deregulation in the electric industry and more w ary of its potential benefits The survey considered the opinions of c onsumers nationwide and found that the number of consumers who are aware o f changes in retail electric markets has dropped to percent compared with percent in This is a reversal in a fiveyear trend of inc reasing consumer awareness on deregulation Analysts cited the terrorist a ttacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on deregulation as re asons for the change The survey also found that more consumers expect ele ctric rates to increase with deregulation Deloitte and Touches Brank Ter zi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from competition w hile percent expect prices to go down percent expect improved servic e and percent simply dont know Another study completed by RKS Rese arch and Consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that deregul ation has been a colossal failure Their study found that many consumers who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed because their service expectations were not met RKS Senior Vice President Carmine Grastataro said customers of public power are more satisfied with the j ob their utility is doing than are customers of the IOUs Although this fin ding has historically remained true the difference in performance scores between public power and IOUs is exacerbated in states where competition i s under way The study also found that consumers are more interested in p urchasing power through buying groups voluntary energy curtailment progra ms and onsite generation FERC Postpones December RTO Deadline The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has officially decided to postpone the December deadline for utilities to create four regi onal transmission organizations RTO FERC Chairman Pat Wood said of the decision RTO development is in very different stages in various parts of the country and it is not possible for all RTOs to be in operation by th e December deadline established in Order The commission ha s approved a rulemaking order RM that addresses the development of RTOs in several steps First the Commission will develop a broader defini tion of the expected functions of an RTO and how they can be achieved Sec ond FERC will seek improved input and communication from both state and f ederal agencies on RTO development Third FERC will conduct a formal cost benefit analysis of RTO systems This comes in response to two conflictin g studies NY ISO reports that a large Northeast RTO could cause power rat es to increase by million while Mirant contends that a Northeast RTO could save consumers million The rulemaking also calls for FERC to d etermine areas in which standardization can be improved Lastly a new pr ogressive timeline will be developed that addresses RTO development in a regionbyregion approach While Chairman Wood said that the commission is holding to its original concept of four RTOs he also noted that the new order suggests that three smaller RTOs may be developed within the Western region These transmission groups would include RTO West Desert Star RTO and one based on the California ISO The rulemaking also makes a call fo r comments in what Commissioner Nora Brownell noted as possibly the last o pportunity for market participants and state regulators to make suggestion s and raise concerns before final orders are issued Ontario deregulation in doubt The planned deregulation of the billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the provinc es electricity transmission company preventing it from becoming a signif icant player in an open North American power market The plan known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insider s would turn Hydro One into a notforprofit entity instead of a fully co mmercial privatized company If this happens Hydro One would lack the fl exibility to raise equity capital make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continents premier transmission companies a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe Da vid Lindsay the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBui ld Corp the governments privatization adviser confirmed that turning H ydro One into a notforprofit organization similar to Nav Canada the ci vil air navigation service is under serious consideration Weve been as ked to evaluate all options for Hydro Ones future including this one h e said yesterday He would not provide details though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro Ones future ownership st ructure by the conclusion of the year A senior official in the Ontario go vernment who did not want to be identified said the proposal is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro He was referring to the debtla den utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation the electricity generating arm and Hydro One whose network of highvoltage transmission lines spans kilometres The Premiers office would not comment A s pokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that there are a number of options on the table Sources on Bay Street and at Queens Par k said the idea of turning Hydro One into a notforprofit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell the chairman of Royal Bankowned RBC Dominion Securities Bay Streets largest dealer If the new Hydro One took this sh ape it would raise about billion through the sale of bonds to investo rs The dealers commission on the sale of the bonds which would rank amo ng the biggest debt issues in history would range from million to million one Bay Street executive said Mr Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government t o help pay down the billion in stranded debt racked up by the old On tario Hydro The generating and transmission giants decadeslong spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province s balance sheet Hydro Ones cash flow derived from sales to electricity users would be used to pay the interest on the billion of bonds Pre sumably consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lack ed sufficient cash to pay the interest If Hydro One were a private company instead its financial risk would be borne by shareholders not ratepayer s The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts th e financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan citing client confidentiality concerns Mr Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity marke t in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices by next spring The m arket overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One both of which are per cent owned by the government into commercial companies In Hydro Ones case the leading options were thought to be an outright sale in which the utility would be bought by another company pr esumably a rival utility or an initial public offering where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange The third option converting Hydro One into a notforprofit organization has come as a surprise There has been no debate on this option though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One both of whi ch were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eve ntually become a commercial enterprise Sources said that Hydro One manage ment opposes the notforprofit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business The notf orprofit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes which raises potential trade issues with the United States American transmission comp anies might argue that Hydro Ones nontaxable status gives it an unfair c ompetitive advantage It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options Rod Taylor Hydro Ones executive vicepresident would not comment on the notforprofitoption being conte mplated by the government He said however that the companys strategy h inges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North Ame rican electricity market Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity and become in the transmission sector what Canadian Nat ional is to the rail sector he said in a phone interview Stanley Hartt the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Streets Salomon Smith Barney is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a notforprofit structur e for Hydro One Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro Ones str ategic business plan In a threepage letter sent this week to the top ex ecutives of several large powerusing Ontario companies he said that thi s idea is shortsighted and bad for Ontario He argued that the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the notforprofit corp oration essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers He also said that without financial flexibility Hydro One would lack the resource s to invest in new bottleneckeliminating connections that would allow t he company to become a significant electricity exporter Ontario would lo se the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmiss ion he said In a recent report on the power industry TD Newcrest analy st David McCracken wrote With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmiss ion grids in the northern United States where ownership tends to be fragm ented He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next f ew years and he said the utility has the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive highgrowth initiatives According to sources familiar with the notforprofit proposal Hydro O ne would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by sto cking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are he avy power users such as auto and steel makers and paper companies Such a structure exists at Nav Canada with airline executives on the board and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers Restructu ring Hydro One with debt rather than equity is also presented as the mos t efficient way to capitalize the company The problem with a Canadian Na tional Railstyle IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt sai d one financier familiar with the proposal With a debtbased structure every dollar earned is available to pay interest while an equitybased st ructure means you pay federal taxes provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments Dofasco Inc the big Ontario steel producer that con sumes about million of electricity a year supports the notforprofi t proposal Gord Forstner head of communications said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydros stranded debt by billion immediately paving th e way for lower electricity charges Currently a special levy on all elec tricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt The charge costs Dof asco alone about million a year We want to see the stranded debt pai d down first Mr Forstner said Until that happens we dont favour Hyd ro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontarios boundaries Retail Access Requested in California The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets AReM has asked the California Sup reme Court to overturn the state Public Utilities Commissions September th decision that suspended direct retail access across the state The con sumer group comprised of American Utility Network the Alliance for Retai l Energy Markets California League of Food Processors Western Power Trad ing Forum Strategic Energy ABI Foundry Tricon Global Restaurants and S chool Project for Utility Rate Reduction has argued that the ruling was m ade without due process and that the Court had no right to abrogate contra cts retroactively It is our hope that the Supreme Court recognizes the P UC has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rus hed to judgment on this issue without hearings and without creating a pro per evidentiary record said AReM Attorney Dan Douglass PUC Commissioner Carl Wood has maintained that the PUC issued the order because it believe d that consumers have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers leaving fewer customers to pay for the states wholesale power costs ARe M is disputing the claim saying that only a limited number of customers s witched suppliers during the summer of Plant Construction Influences Floridas Wholesale Market California based Calpine Corporation announced that it has begun construct ion of a megawatt power plant in Auburndale Florida The construction brings Florida closer to deregulation as Calpine is one of the few outo fstate generating companies to successfully penetrate Floridas wholesale electricity market Other companies such as Enron have attempted to con struct new power plants in the state but have been unsuccessful due to co mmunity and regulatory resistance Floridas stringent Power Plant Siting Act makes it very difficult for outofstate companies to enter the market Calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the Auburndale plant under a longterm contract to one of Floridas existing utilities Seminole Electric Cooperative In addition Calpine has been working with the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity to persuade lawmakers and Governor Bush to deregulate Floridas wholesale market Flor idas Energy Study Commission which is responsible for the states c ompetition plan has endorsed a proposal to allow outofstate companies t o enter Floridas wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe r to the states incumbent utilities The Commission has also suggested el iminating the power of state government to approve power plant development and limiting the ability of local governments to block projects The Comm ission is expected to issue a final report on December Florida PSC Approves Independent Power Line Operations The Florida Public Service Commission PSC has approved the transfer of t he states power lines from utility jurisdiction to an independent company The PSC has asked Floridas three main utilities Florida Power and Ligh t FPL Florida and Power Corporation and Tampa Electric to devise a pr oposal within days that will turn over operation of the power lines to an independent system operator Commissioner Michael A Palecki said that the decision was made in the best interest for ratepayers utility compani es and independent power companies seeking a competitive market Under an earlier proposal submitted to the PSC the utilities proposed a statewide regional transmission organization GridFlorida that would have owned and managed the power lines The PSC did not approve the plan as it would ha ve moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Com mission New England Congressmen Seek Equal Representation on RTO Board Twentythree US congressmen from New England requested that their states be given adequate representation on the governance of the Northeast Regio nal Transmission Organization RTO In an effort organized by Representat ive Edward Markey DMass the bipartisan delegation of congressmen wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC asking the re gulators to create a governing board comprised of equal numbers of represe ntatives from New England New York and the MidAtlantic We view an equ ally balanced governance structure as the only way in which a single marke t design can be implemented which would truly benefit the consumers of all the regions Markey said FERC has been considering several options for structuring the board that will oversee the unified Northeast wholesale po wer market One proposal gives five seats for representatives from the Mid Atlantic three seats to New York and two to New England ISO New Englan d and New York Independent System Operator joined the congressman in oppos ing that plan and requesting equal representation California Wants Consumers to See Real Power Costs In a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of the wholesale electricity market in California the California Consumer Power and Financing Authorit y wants to install electricity meters that charge consumers the real cost of power Currently consumers pay the same price for electricity throughou t the day even though the wholesale price varies every hour Therefore co nsumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times The meters will c harge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours when de mand is highest and less during off peak times The authority issued reque sts for proposals due by November for a minimum of realtime m eters the cost of which varies between and The power authorit y plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to cust omers of Pacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison San Diego Gas Electric and dozens of municipal utilities As consumers have shown to be responsive to price signals in a pilot program in Washington Californi ans too can expect to reduce their energy consumption Project manger Kev in Wood of Southern California Edison hopes his company will install meter s for customers by next summer He said that if these customers wh o represent to percent of the load respond to price signals during peak hours this may in turn drive down wholesale prices for all users Wh ile consumers may benefit the decrease in consumption may cost power gene rators millions of dollars in revenue Environmentalists and Union Coalition Oppose Deregulation in Indiana A coalition of union members from several groups showed their opposition t o electric utility deregulation in Indiana during a peaceful demonstration on November The coalition know as Peoples Energy Campaign includes members from UNITE Local formerly the Ladies Garment Workers Union t he Central Labor Council Valley Watch environmental group and the Citize ns Action Coalition Denny Owen an executive board member of UNITE Local expressed the general concern of the coalition that deregulation shou ld be discouraged We dont think itll make prices lower itll make the m go higher Owen said Indiana is considered to have low utility rates c ompared to other states Indiana lawmakers are considering deregulation as newly introduced legislation proposes to create an Energy Policy Commissi on that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state Senator Gar d and other General Assembly members created the bill to address the state s need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric load growth Merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past year and a half Gard said There are many people who feel if the state has a comprehensive energy policy it might be better able to deal with t his issue And we also have to pay attention to whats happened in Califor nia The bill would set up a temporary commission with appointed members representing various stakeholder groups including state government indust ry labor and environmental groups The commission is scheduled to presen t a final report to the governor in December While electric deregula tion would not be a prime focus of the commission the specter of deregul ation would have to be examined in some fashion Senator Gard said SB has been sent to the Senate Rules and Legislative Procedures Committee Senator Gard predicts it will pass the Senate although chances in the Hou se of Representatives are less favorable Debate Over Oklahoma Transmission Systems Readiness to Serve Future Load The Electric Restructuring Advisory Committee met with industry officials on November to discuss the future capabilities of Oklahomas transmissio n system The committee is responsible for researching the capabilities of the system determining whether upgrades are necessary and delegating th e responsibility for paying for such upgrades With new power plants being developed and proposals to open the state to a competitive electric marke t in progress concern has risen as to whether the transmission system can handle the increased load Stanton Hadley of Oak Ridge National Laborator y reported that electricity demand in Oklahoma is expected to grow perc ent to megawatts by The transmission system currently is abl e to handle only megawatts Nevertheless power companies are plann ing megawatts of new power generation Calpine Corporation is spend ing about million on transmission improvements between its power plant near Coweta Oklahoma and the outlying region Also Public Service Comp any of Oklahoma plans to spend million on transmission upgrades over t he next few years With the new power plants and a supply surplus expected Hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs John Wright o ne of the committee members questioning this assumption said that in a de regulated market the utilities are likely to sell their power out of state If this were to occur lower power prices would be unlikely The Electri c Restructuring Advisory Committee will deliver a report to the Legislatur e at the end of the year Thirty New Power Plants Proposed for Virginia The latest news out of the deregulation of Virginias electric power indus try centers around thirty proposals for new power plants in the state Whi le the surge in supply is expected to prevent a Californialike energy cri sis health and environmentalists argue that the air pollution and smog fr om the plants could damage the states parks and forests Since when the state announced its plans to open its energy markets to competition companies and utilities have asked for state approval to build new plant s Activists complain that the new power would not even benefit Virginias customers as the energy is intended for delivery in northeastern states By building plants in Virginia utilities avoid the Northeasts stringent environmental regulations An advisory group composed of utility and indu stry representatives argues that new plants pose no significant risk They stated that of the new plants would run on cleanerburning natural gas and that other federal regulations would require older plants to reduce h armful emissions by percent by The representatives also

Substitute or Add an email address to our list please send bri ef message to FERC Rejects Reasons for Suppliers Higher Prices In an order issued on October the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC rejected the cost justifications of several power suppliers that so ld wholesale electricity above the proxy marketclearing price during July The electricity had been sold into the California Independent Syste m Operator CAISO and Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC FERC said that the justifications from Dynegy Reliant Energy Mirant and Willi ams Energy were either untimely filed andor unsupported and has ordered refunds on those transactions The four suppliers submitted their cost ju stifications in compliance with FERCs April order that established pri ce mitigation for sales into the CAISOs spot markets starting in late Ma y That order required power suppliers and generators who submitted bids a bove the marketclearing price to file a justification for the higher pric es within seven days of the end of the month in which the sale occurred F ERC did not disclose how much money would be refunded since the four compa nies requested that the matter be treated confidentially In a separate ca se FERC Administrative Law Judge Bruce Birchman has until March to issu e a report on whether California is entitled to refunds of nearly billi on for wholesale power purchases when prices skyrocketed in the past year The reports recommendations will be considered by FERC commissioners for further action Nuclear plant had long list of failings Inexperience sloppy work habits and poor maintenance increased the chance s of dangerous accidents at the Bruce nuclear power station in Ontario th e worlds largest atomic facility says a secret report obtained by The Gl obe and Mail The report was compiled in by a group of highly trained independent nuclear experts from the World Association of Nuclear Operat ors WANO an industry advisory group based in Atlanta It was given to O ntario Power Generation the provincially owned utility the following year Among its findings Some operators were unaware of such important topics as the time it would take for water in reactors to begin boiling away if flows of cooling water were blocked Nuclearplant operators disconnected warning alarms they found too noisy Operators sometimes did not watch ins trument control panels but had their backs turned to them which could sl ow any response to a problem Should an inadvertent loss of primary heat transport coolant occur operator response could be delayed resulting in a loss of core cooling More than nuclearplant modifications were not incorporated into design manuals leading to confusion about how the p lant actually runs There was a backlog in preventive and corrective maint enance and some maintenance work was poorly done WANO tried to block The Globes access to the report which listed dozens of other sloppy practice s at the Bruce facility and a second related report that found troubling safety lapses at the Pickering nuclear station But the organization recen tly abandoned a court challenge seeking to have the documents remain confi dential It is the first time WANO reports assessing the performance of nu clear plants have been publicly released anywhere in the world A Bruce st ation official said its performance has improved dramatically since the cr itical report was written WANO now considers Bruce one of the fastest im proving nuclear plants in North America said Duncan Hawthorne chief exe cutive officer at the site One nuclear energy critic said concerns raised in the report about possible loss of cooling an interruption in the flo w of water that keeps a reactor from overheating describes an event tha t could cause a serious mishap by allowing unwanted nuclear chain reaction s It could result in some form of criticality accident which could even tually lead to a meltdown said David Martin a nuclear safety consultant with the Sierra Club of Canada The Globe and Mail requested the reports under Ontarios freedom of information act in Both Ontario Power and WANO opposed the releases Ontario Power argued that public knowledge of the reports would jeopardize its finances and increase the cost of its lia bility insurance The government utility completed a longterm agreement l easing the Bruce facility located on the shores of Lake Huron to a unit of British Energy earlier this year WANO in seeking to keep the records secret asserted nuclear safety is enhanced if the public is kept in the d ark about its findings because nuclear staff are more likely to be honest about mistakes if their remarks are kept confidential But Ontarios Infor mation and Privacy Commissioner ruled last year there was a compelling in terest for the public to have the nuclearsafety information Shortly aft er the newspaper made its request for the records the Ontario government changed its information law to exempt provincially owned electricity compa nies from the act blocking future public access to these safety reports The WANO reports known as peer reviews were viewed at the highest level o f the utility with copies sent to Ronald Osborne Ontario Powers preside nt During WANO reviews a team of nuclear experts scours the plant looki ng for sloppy work practices poor maintenance and inadequate training wh ile also trying to discover the causes of these failings At the Bruce pla nt WANO officials reviewed four of the eight reactors The officials foun d the failure to keep accurate designs at the station known as Bruce B h elped create confusion over three unplanned reactor shutdowns in that were caused by the triggering of automatic safety systems Operators had a hard time figuring out why the shutdowns happened because the designs sh owed wiring layouts from the wrong nuclear stations The report also noted that forced reactor shutdowns were caused by equipment problems These have arisen because the station had a large and increasing backlog in p reventive and corrective maintenance tasks Staff also conducted incompet ent maintenance work In one case a pump needing an overhaul was taken fr om service but it was later discovered that the spare parts for this work were unavailable The pump was subsequently returned to service without undergoing the associated maintenance the report said I there were about corrective maintenance tasks at the station Mr Hawthorne sai d that total is now less than reflecting the plants improving perfor mance However there was a backlog of about preventive maintenance tasks in a figure that has since grown to Mr Hawthorne said t he total of preventive jobs is considered normal within the industry Barton Adds Supports for FERC Authority and RTOs Senate Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTX has revised his draft electricity bill to support the Federal Energy Regulator y Commissions FERC proposed requirement that forces utilities to partic ipate in regional transmission organizations RTOs The proposal requires that all transmitting utilities form or participate in an RTO within m onths Bartons draft bill also gives additional authority to FERC by allo wing the commission to propose changes to applications if minimum standards are not met Utilities would have the right to appeal FERCs decision to the federal courts While FERC is pushing for the creation of four RTOs B artons draft bill does not recommend a specific number of RTOs The revis ed legislation requires a MW generation minimum from any new RTO T his requirement was added to minimize the amount of interRTO transmission problems The bill includes an incentive rate provision which opponents c laim would undermine FERCs authority to determine just and reasonable rat es Proponents argue that incentive rates are necessary to account for the inherent risks that transmission companies face FERCs Public Access Rulemaking is Questioned A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC proposed rulemaking on public access of informational filings is generating mixed reactions FERC is pr oposing that utilities and power marketers electronically file an index o f customers on a quarterly basis with a summary of the contractual terms and conditions for marketbased power sales costbased power sales and t ransmission services The proposed rule would require that the information be posted on a publicly available Internet website State regulators see FERCs July rulemaking proposal as an opportunity to improve regulatory ov ersight of competitive markets The National Association of Regulatory Uti lity Commissioners NARUC applauds the proposal stating One of the mos t important and formidable tools in market monitoring is access to data th at is readily available and useful to the public However utilities are warning FERC that making such proprietary and commercially sensitive info rmation available to the public could be harmful to the development of r obust electricity markets The Edison Electric Institutes Alliance of En ergy Suppliers is requesting that FERC defer action on the rulemaking Debate Over Use of PJM as Model for Northeast RTO Wholesale suppliers and the PJM Interconnection have recommended that PJMs market design and governance structure be used as a model for a Northeast regional transmission organization RTO They believe that using the PJM model would facilitate the quickest transition from the current system of independent system operators ISOs to one large RTO Duke Energy North A merica reported to Platts Electric Power Daily that The PJM marketbuildi ng philosophy of cautious incremental modular building blocks which emph asizes marketdriven solutions rather than commandandcontrol decision an d frequent market interventions has worked far better than approaches take n in either New York or New England Administrative Law Judge Peter Young recommended on September to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis sion FERC that PJM be used as a starting point Young proposed an RTO pl an that would have an operational RTO within months of the FERC order His recommendations resulted from the July mediation talks that discu ssed the creation of a Northeast RTO FERC has since asked for comments re garding Youngs plan Enron and PJM contend that an RTO could be operation al within one year if FERC acts expeditiously New York ISO and New Englan d ISO argue that FERC should consider another approach because using PJM a s a model would ignore geographic and philosophic differences The PJM uti lities do not have divested generating assets as do the two regions not c overed by PJM The ISOs also pointed out that PJM does not contain socalle d load centers like New York City or Boston Support for Delay in Arkansas Deregulation Entergy Arkansas largest electric utility has agreed with State Attorney General Mark Pryor to support a delay in the states restructuring effort s An amended restructuring statute in effect as of April pushed back the start date of deregulation to October The Public Service Commi ssion PSC was given the authority to delay deregulation further until if necessary to ensure that deregulation will benefit consumers Severa l concerns still exist according to local sources A study by La Capra As sociates showed that Arkansas consumers might experience higher more vola tile electric rates if the retail market is deregulated before October The study also reports that wholesale electric markets and operating el ectronic systems havent developed both are necessary for successful reta il market competition Entergys President Hugh McDonald has also expres sed concern that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC push to create four regional transmission organizations RTOs may slow the move to retail competition Additionally State Attorney General Pryor has note d that two utilities serving the Arkansas market are experiencing difficul ty meeting the January deregulation deadline in Texas The governor PSC and the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation consider repeal of deregulation to be the best choice for consumers Entergy believes repeal is unnecessary and that delaying until will cause no harm to consumer s A PSC hearing on the topic is set for October Entergy seeks deregulation delay in Texas Texas is experiencing a less than seamless transition to a competitive ret ail electric market Entergy Corp has asked the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUC to delay deregulation in the Southeast Texas service area for months transmission congestion is costing some Texas utilities mi llions of dollars and reports show that Texas consumers have been subject to slamming switching utility providers without their consent Enterg ys request is a turnaround from the corporations announcement in Septemb er that deregulation should move forward and that it was ready to move int o a competitive marketplace The corporation has now filed a memorandum al ong with the PUC staff an industrial electricity users group and the Off ice of the Public Utility Council asking the PUC to delay deregulation fo r months Entergys spokesperson says that the request stems from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions and Entergys inability to come to consensus on an independent regional transmission operator Problems For Texas on the Path To Deregulation Municipallyowned Austin Energy is among a group of Texas utilities that h ave experienced rising costs in a deregulated energy market Their agreeme nt to share transmission costs across the state for generated electricity is costing more than anticipated The PUC and the Electric Reliability Cou ncil of Texas ERCOT estimated last year that a state program designed to ensure that enough electricity can move around the state during peak peri ods would cost utilities million in the year starting July S ince each utilitys share of the cost is based on its use of the grid Aust in Energy expected its percent share to be for the first year However Austin Energy has already been billed approximately million fo r the period between July and September North Carolina Regulators Oppose Southeastern RTO The North Carolina Utilities Commission NCUC has expressed opposition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC move to create four regi onal transmission organizations RTOs In September an administrative la w judge reported on closeddoor mediation discussions aimed at developing an RTO in the Southeast NCUC considers the day long talks illegal FER C supports the creation of a Southeast RTO reflecting RTO proposals submi tted by GridSouth GridFlorida and Entergy NCUC objects that FERC is now attempting to strip retail customers of all rights to existing transm ission capacity and make it availableto relatively new entities such a s Independent Power Producers and marketers This attempt must fail NCUC says that it will take its case to court to prevent FERC from moving forw ard on this issue Slamming reported in Texas pilot program Problems arising from Texas move towards a competitive retail electric ma rket have also spread to the consumers Under the states pilot project percent of the market was opened to competition allowing companies to co mpete for consumers by offering lower prices and different service plans The Texas deregulation law strictly prohibits slamming electric provide rs switching consumers service without obtaining permission New Power Co mpany received at least complaints about slamming Green Mountain Reli ant First Choice and Shell each received one slamming complaint The Fo rt Worth StarTelegram reported that complaints have been filed between March and September concerning billing procedures delay s in the pilot project customer service and deceptive trade practices On one positive note for consumers the PUC has published a consumer educati on brochure The Electricity Facts Label What it is and How it Will Help You Shop for Electricity The brochure will help consumers understand the new electricity labels that Retail Electric Providers REPs are required to provide when retail competition begins The label gives information on electricity prices contract terms generation sources and emissions in a standardized format The labels are intended to help customers make info rmed decisions about choosing their electric service Texas Power Supply to Increase Two new developments in Texas are expected to increase power supply in the state American Electric Power Co AEP is currently seeking approval fr om the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUC to provide energy supply s ervices to large commercial and industrial customers if deregulation begin s in January AEP has a total of about million customers in Texas w ith its three subsidiaries Central Power and Light Co West Texas Utilit ies and Southwestern Electric Power Co The company expects the PUC to act within two to three months In addition Steag Power the Houstonbased u nit of Germanybased electricity utility Steag AG plans to develop a MW to MW gasfired power station in Ennis Texas The company submit ted its application to the Electric Reliabilty Council of Texas and the So uthwest Power Pool Construction is planned to begin next year and reach c ommercial operation by The plant will increase Texas generating cap acity and may help to relieve the states congestion problem of transmittin g power from south to north New power plants as well as new transmission lines are needed in the north to ease congestion Bingaman to Resume Work on Comprehensive Energy Bill Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman DNe w Mexico will resume consideration of a comprehensive energy bill the wee k of October The bill includes provisions related to electricity restr ucturing including expansion of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission s FERC authority over municipal and cooperative utilities The proposed legislation would also allow regional transmission organizations to rely o n FERC to rule when transmission projects are delayed or rejected by state officials Federal Trade Commission Issues Report on Electric Power Regulatory Reform A new report has been issued by the Federal Trade Commission FTC that ex amines state retail electricity programs and their ability to provide cons umer benefits Competition and Consumer Protection Perspectives on Electri c Power Regulatory Reform Focus on Retail Competition compares state and federal authority on competitive issues and implementation of successful r etail competition programs The FTC report finds that most electric market s are in a transitional phase The benefits of a competitive market will n ot be realized until the advent of full competition without price regulati on has been achieved The report also explains that competitive wholesale markets must accompany competition in retail markets The report notes as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies an d jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful The FTC report also cites that artificially low standardoffer rates which are provided to customers w ho do not choose a new supplier may act as a barrier for new retail suppl iers These low rates reduce the incentive for customers to seek alternati ve suppliers The report urges retail suppliers to offer competitive meter ing and billing services in addition to variable pricing for generation se rvices Standardized labeling of power products and services enforcement of truthinadvertising laws and consumer education efforts will help con sumers make informed decisions Supreme Court Hears Arguments on OpenAccess Rules The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday on Federal Energy Regulator y Commission FERC jurisdiction to regulate wholesale transmission servic es and power sales The Courts ruling will have an important impact on th e US power market It could either open the transmission grid to retail competition or limit competition to the retail level As Dow Jones reports The case has great ramifications for congressional debate on electric i ndustry restructuring legislation and FERCs ongoing efforts to promote co mpetition as a surrogate for regulation Nine states led by New York arg ued that FERC overstepped its authority with Order that required util ities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants Lawre nce Malone general counsel for the group argued that the order preempted state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates In FERC car ried the order further by mandating that utilities turn over control of th eir power lines to independent regional transmission organizations or RTO s The states are appealing the District of Columbia Court of Appeals deci sion in June that upheld FERCs orders Currently FERC is working to establish four RTOs to control the nations transmission system Meanwhil e Enron the largest US wholesale power player argued that FERC violat ed federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines whe n utilities kept transmission and retail sales as one operation This bund led service remains in many states where competition is not yet allowed C aught in the middle FERC argued that its orders were issued to achieve a balance between giving competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states FERC Chairman Unveils Plans Pat Wood the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions new Chairman has pro posed a set of issues on which he wants the Commission to focus At the Co mmissions September th meeting Wood proposed the following for FERCs upcoming agenda ensuring adequate generation capacity transmission const raints regional transmission organizations RTOs energy infrastructure standards of conduct for transmission providers market monitoring and en forcement and market based rates One important proposal unveiled at this meeting would mandate that transmission owning utilities be given until D ecember to join an approved RTO or lose their right to charge ma rket based rates Additionally Wood recommended that mergers would only b e approved for power entities belonging to operational RTOs Once the ent ire country is covered by RTOs he said states will have the option to deregulate on the retail level or not Wood also proposed a rulemaking on market design and structure in order to make a seamless national power ma rketplace A new transmission tariff would replace the pro forma open acce ss transmission tariff established by Order Staff at FERC discussed c hanging the Commissions methodology for assessing market power for the pu rpose of approving marketbased rate applications While none of the propo sals were voted on the meeting was important for opening up discussion and addressing the Commissions key challenges and objectives for the coming year A series of commissionerled workshops will be held at FERCs headqu arters from October Congestion management cost recovery mar ket monitoring transmission planning business and reliability standards and the nature of transmission rights have been proposed for discussion a t the workshops Maryland and DC Blast FERC on RTO plan Both the Maryland and Washington DC public service commissions have expres sed concern over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC initiat ive to integrate the US Northeast transmission network In a new plan pr oposed by FERC Chairman Pat Wood utilities would have to submit plans by December to join a regional transmission organization RTO or l ose the right to sell electricity in the wholesale market Catherine Reill y Chairman of the Maryland Public Utility Commission is concerned about the plans effect on the Northeasts economy and the potential for creatin g another Californiatype crisis The Maryland Commission held hearings on RTOs in Baltimore on Wednesday and Thursday of this week Southwest and Midwest Utilities Form Transmission Groups FERCs push for utilities to merge their networks into regional transmissi on organizations RTOs came one step closer to being realized this week Six Southwestern utilities have signed an initial Memorandum of Understan ding regarding the formation and operation of an RTO and plan to file wit h FERC by midOctober The new RTO WestConnect will be created by Arizon a Public Service Co Salt River Project El Paso Electric Co Public Ser vice Company of New Mexico Tucson Electric Power Co and TexasNew Mexic o Power Co In addition six Midwestern utilities filed with FERC last Fri day to create an independent forprofit transmission company TRANSLink T he utilities include Alliant Energy Corn Belt Power Cooperative MidAmeri can Energy Nebraska Public Power District Xcel Energy and Omaha Public Power District A forprofit entity focused solely on the growth and enh ancement of a robust transmission system over a large region will be much more effective than either the current situation or transferring operatio nal control to an independent system operator said Wayne Brunetti chair man president and CEO of Xcel Energy The six companies have asked FERC to expedite their application so that TRANSLink can be formed by early nex t year North Carolinas Restructuring Plans Still on Hold The North Carolina Study Commission on the Future of Electric Service has decided to place its restructuring deliberations on hold until early next year Study Commission meetings were interrupted early in due to the length of the state legislative session which occupied several Study Comm ission members Members of the Commission have expressed concern about imp lementing electricity restructuring Sen Kay Hagan DGuilford explained that I cant see us doing anythingThere are so many people worried a boutCalifornia Hagan and Rep Mary Jarrell DGuilford also on the C ommission have urged North Carolina to take the steps necessary to avoid t he same problems experienced in California Neither legislator foresees th e Study Commission resuming its deliberations until January Pennsylvania Retail Electricity Shopping Declines According to figures released last Tuesday by the Pennsylvania Office of C onsumer Advocate electricity retail shopping fell during the third quarte r of The number of consumers buying from alternative suppliers dropp ed from July st This decline is less than the drop that occurred between April and July total electric load has declined by since July or of the customers in the state are buying MW from o ther suppliers or approximately of the states total load Again this is less than the decline in electric load purchased from other suppli ers that occurred between April and July According to the Electric Power Daily Online Load fell more dramatically than customer participation in t he spring because many of the expiring longterm contracts were held by la rge industrial and commercial customers Pennsylvania opened its electric ity market to competition in In April of of the state resi dents chose alternative energy suppliers subsequently high gas prices an d tight electric capacity drove up wholesale prices in the summer of Many alternative suppliers pulled out of the market as they were unable to offer competitive prices Participation in the retail electricity marke t has been declining since then Texas ElectricityGrid Operator Needs More Power Lines An annual report released on Monday by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas states that Texas needs more electricity transmission lines raisin g concern as the state plans to open its electricity market to competition in January Without adequate transmission lines congestion problems will likely arise and the flow of power may be interrupted The report ha s identified six zones where more lines are needed to deliver power from s outh to north Texas and to bring electricity into the Dallas area Eight m ajor projects are being developed to address the problems and others are be ing considered

House Energy and Commerce Committee have agreed with Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTexas that restructuring legislation should move forward now th at Congress has a few more weeks in session In an vote last week Rep ublican Committee members decided to continue drafting electricity restruc turing legislation Electricity restructuring provisions were excluded fro m the energy bill approved by the House earlier this year The issue was to be readdressed in the fall but was delayed due to the events on September th No action has been taken to date in the Senate Green Mountain Energy Expands Into Ohios Restructured Market Green Mountain Energy Company has entered into an agreement with the North east Ohio Public Energy Council NOPEC to service northeastern Ohio with solar and windgenerated electricity NOPEC was formed last year under Ohi os utility deregulation statute Senate Bill which allows local governm ents to serve as aggregators for electricity customers NOPEC consists of local communities with approximately energy customers Under t he agreement Green Mountain Energy will construct a kilowatt solar arr ay at Lake Farmpark in Kirtland Ohio and will conduct a study to determi ne the feasibility of siting a wind generating facility in Ohio The Green Mountain Energy solar array will be the largest in the state and the firs t commercial solar array in Ohio built for the competitive market The pro posed wind study will be the first commercial wind analysis executed solely for the competitive market Debate Over Deregulation Impacts in Oklahoma Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL has reported in a firstofits kind study that restructuring Oklahomas electric industry can benefit consume rs but problems and potential pitfalls do exist The report has been met with some opposition however Pete Churchwell president of Oklahomas sec ond largest electric utility AEPPSO stated on November th that he does not support the studys findings one of which indicates that Oklahomas e nergy costs could rise between and percent if the retail electricity market is opened to competition The study results indicate that lower ele ctric prices may be available in the short term but restructuring will ul timately bring higher prices Under the states restructuring plan existi ng generating plants will have a competitive advantage over new plants Th is advantage will result in higher prices in the long term because newer highercost plants may be forced out of the marketplace Churchwell contes ts that it is too early to know for certain how consumer rates will react in a deregulated market While admitting that the nations grid was not de signed for retail competition Churchwell said that improvements in state transmission systems would allow a successful retail competitive market Utility still looks to be freed of generators Clark Public Utilities has been trying in vain for two months to unload so me of the portable generators that have become a multimilliondollar wh ite elephant The units wired in rows near the River Road Generating Pla nt were leased for a year for million The deal was signed with Gen eral Electric early this year at a time when there were dire predictions about this summers power supply In addition to the equipment lease the re is a million natural gas contract to power the generators and a rou ghly million expense to transport the gas While Clark has been able to resell some of the gas at a loss the transportation costs cant be reco uped For weeks electricity on the open market has been much cheaper tha n that produced by the generators In place since July the generators e ach producing megawatt of power have run for just days Electricity prices have plunged from a high of per megawatthour this summer to less than today The price has to be about to make operating the g enerators feasible So utility officials have had no choice but to let the m sit idle In September the net expense for the generator farm gas gen erator lease and so on was million For no electricity Utility offi cials have tried to get GE to find customers for at least some of the gen erators Tuesday morning Andy Huck Clarks operations director said he had heard from GE about a pretty serious inquiry for two generators for two months And that he said is the best inquiry theyve had so far Now utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending a month for three GE employees and other expenses associated with maint aining the generators The theory is that the equipment should be tested a few at a time to ensure they will be ready if needed They told me t he generators need to be exercised said Huck I told them they spent two months on a ship without being started The units were built in Austr ia GE with a signed oneyear lease in hand has little incentive to fin d customers for the equipment particularly when the company could presuma bly lease other generators from its inventory They say its because we re such good client that an effort has been made to find other users for the generators said Huck Clarks million River Road generating plan t features a giant GE turbine Clark officials dont hold out much hope o f getting out from under the generator lease expense which runs about million per month Where would they go asked Jim Sanders Clarks dir ector of energy resources Meanwhile the natural gas supply for the equi pment is being resold at about half what it cost the utility Gas prices a lso have fallen since the supply deal was inked At their regular Tuesday meeting utility commissioners decided to proceed with a million bon d sale that includes money to pay for the generator lease In March Rick Dyer Clarks finance director recommended that the utility cut a deal f or a oneyear million bond anticipation note The arrangement was made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few months whi ch they have to levels The move Tuesday gave Dyer and utility Gener al Manager Wayne Nelson the OK to approve a bond sale of up to years at percent interest although percent or less is more likely and the goa l is a year term officials said The bond sale likely will occur in t he first week of December The bulk of the million borrowing is to cov er a million power purchase from Kaiser Aluminum The deal like the g enerator lease was for power to cover an AugustSeptember gap in Clarks power supply before the start of a Bonneville Power Administration contra ct That Kaiser purchase was at a megawatthour The utility lost a bid to have a federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a parti al refund AEP Reliant Named as Last Resort Providers in Texas The Texas Public Utility Commission PUC has named American Electric Powe r AEP and Reliant Resources affiliates providers of last resort POLR for residential and smallcommercial customers in all or part of count ies within TXU Electrics service area The POLR becomes the electricity p rovider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider due to payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s area AEP and Reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect January By becoming the POLR AEP and Reliant will acquire an additional milli on Dallasarea customers and an expected percent load increase Due t o the higher costs associated with such an increased load the PUC was agre eable to the higher rate Consumer groups are opposing the higher rates s aying that lowincome consumers will be unfairly hurt Although many lowi ncome consumers will qualify for a percent discount advocates are argui ng that POLR rates should equal the regular rates Studies Show Changing Consumer Views Towards Deregulation A recent study by Deloitte and Touche Energy Resources Group finds that co nsumers are less aware of deregulation in the electric industry and more w ary of its potential benefits The survey considered the opinions of c onsumers nationwide and found that the number of consumers who are aware o f changes in retail electric markets has dropped to percent compared with percent in This is a reversal in a fiveyear trend of inc reasing consumer awareness on deregulation Analysts cited the terrorist a ttacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on deregulation as re asons for the change The survey also found that more consumers expect ele ctric rates to increase with deregulation Deloitte and Touches Brank Ter zi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from competition w hile percent expect prices to go down percent expect improved servic e and percent simply dont know Another study completed by RKS Rese arch and Consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that deregul ation has been a colossal failure Their study found that many consumers who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed because their service expectations were not met RKS Senior Vice President Carmine Grastataro said customers of public power are more satisfied with the j ob their utility is doing than are customers of the IOUs Although this fin ding has historically remained true the difference in performance scores between public power and IOUs is exacerbated in states where competition i s under way The study also found that consumers are more interested in p urchasing power through buying groups voluntary energy curtailment progra ms and onsite generation FERC Postpones December RTO Deadline The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has officially decided to postpone the December deadline for utilities to create four regi onal transmission organizations RTO FERC Chairman Pat Wood said of the decision RTO development is in very different stages in various parts of the country and it is not possible for all RTOs to be in operation by th e December deadline established in Order The commission ha s approved a rulemaking order RM that addresses the development of RTOs in several steps First the Commission will develop a broader defini tion of the expected functions of an RTO and how they can be achieved Sec ond FERC will seek improved input and communication from both state and f ederal agencies on RTO development Third FERC will conduct a formal cost benefit analysis of RTO systems This comes in response to two conflictin g studies NY ISO reports that a large Northeast RTO could cause power rat es to increase by million while Mirant contends that a Northeast RTO could save consumers million The rulemaking also calls for FERC to d etermine areas in which standardization can be improved Lastly a new pr ogressive timeline will be developed that addresses RTO development in a regionbyregion approach While Chairman Wood said that the commission is holding to its original concept of four RTOs he also noted that the new order suggests that three smaller RTOs may be developed within the Western region These transmission groups would include RTO West Desert Star RTO and one based on the California ISO The rulemaking also makes a call fo r comments in what Commissioner Nora Brownell noted as possibly the last o pportunity for market participants and state regulators to make suggestion s and raise concerns before final orders are issued Ontario deregulation in doubt The planned deregulation of the billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the provinc es electricity transmission company preventing it from becoming a signif icant player in an open North American power market The plan known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insider s would turn Hydro One into a notforprofit entity instead of a fully co mmercial privatized company If this happens Hydro One would lack the fl exibility to raise equity capital make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continents premier transmission companies a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe Da vid Lindsay the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBui ld Corp the governments privatization adviser confirmed that turning H ydro One into a notforprofit organization similar to Nav Canada the ci vil air navigation service is under serious consideration Weve been as ked to evaluate all options for Hydro Ones future including this one h e said yesterday He would not provide details though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro Ones future ownership st ructure by the conclusion of the year A senior official in the Ontario go vernment who did not want to be identified said the proposal is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro He was referring to the debtla den utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation the electricity generating arm and Hydro One whose network of highvoltage transmission lines spans kilometres The Premiers office would not comment A s pokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that there are a number of options on the table Sources on Bay Street and at Queens Par k said the idea of turning Hydro One into a notforprofit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell the chairman of Royal Bankowned RBC Dominion Securities Bay Streets largest dealer If the new Hydro One took this sh ape it would raise about billion through the sale of bonds to investo rs The dealers commission on the sale of the bonds which would rank amo ng the biggest debt issues in history would range from million to million one Bay Street executive said Mr Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government t o help pay down the billion in stranded debt racked up by the old On tario Hydro The generating and transmission giants decadeslong spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province s balance sheet Hydro Ones cash flow derived from sales to electricity users would be used to pay the interest on the billion of bonds Pre sumably consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lack ed sufficient cash to pay the interest If Hydro One were a private company instead its financial risk would be borne by shareholders not ratepayer s The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts th e financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan citing client confidentiality concerns Mr Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity marke t in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices by next spring The m arket overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One both of which are per cent owned by the government into commercial companies In Hydro Ones case the leading options were thought to be an outright sale in which the utility would be bought by another company pr esumably a rival utility or an initial public offering where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange The third option converting Hydro One into a notforprofit organization has come as a surprise There has been no debate on this option though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One both of whi ch were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eve ntually become a commercial enterprise Sources said that Hydro One manage ment opposes the notforprofit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business The notf orprofit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes which raises potential trade issues with the United States American transmission comp anies might argue that Hydro Ones nontaxable status gives it an unfair c ompetitive advantage It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options Rod Taylor Hydro Ones executive vicepresident would not comment on the notforprofitoption being conte mplated by the government He said however that the companys strategy h inges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North Ame rican electricity market Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity and become in the transmission sector what Canadian Nat ional is to the rail sector he said in a phone interview Stanley Hartt the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Streets Salomon Smith Barney is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a notforprofit structur e for Hydro One Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro Ones str ategic business plan In a threepage letter sent this week to the top ex ecutives of several large powerusing Ontario companies he said that thi s idea is shortsighted and bad for Ontario He argued that the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the notforprofit corp oration essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers He also said that without financial flexibility Hydro One would lack the resource s to invest in new bottleneckeliminating connections that would allow t he company to become a significant electricity exporter Ontario would lo se the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmiss ion he said In a recent report on the power industry TD Newcrest analy st David McCracken wrote With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmiss ion grids in the northern United States where ownership tends to be fragm ented He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next f ew years and he said the utility has the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive highgrowth initiatives According to sources familiar with the notforprofit proposal Hydro O ne would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by sto cking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are he avy power users such as auto and steel makers and paper companies Such a structure exists at Nav Canada with airline executives on the board and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers Restructu ring Hydro One with debt rather than equity is also presented as the mos t efficient way to capitalize the company The problem with a Canadian Na tional Railstyle IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt sai d one financier familiar with the proposal With a debtbased structure every dollar earned is available to pay interest while an equitybased st ructure means you pay federal taxes provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments Dofasco Inc the big Ontario steel producer that con sumes about million of electricity a year supports the notforprofi t proposal Gord Forstner head of communications said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydros stranded debt by billion immediately paving th e way for lower electricity charges Currently a special levy on all elec tricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt The charge costs Dof asco alone about million a year We want to see the stranded debt pai d down first Mr Forstner said Until that happens we dont favour Hyd ro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontarios boundaries Retail Access Requested in California The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets AReM has asked the California Sup reme Court to overturn the state Public Utilities Commissions September th decision that suspended direct retail access across the state The con sumer group comprised of American Utility Network the Alliance for Retai l Energy Markets California League of Food Processors Western Power Trad ing Forum Strategic Energy ABI Foundry Tricon Global Restaurants and S chool Project for Utility Rate Reduction has argued that the ruling was m ade without due process and that the Court had no right to abrogate contra cts retroactively It is our hope that the Supreme Court recognizes the P UC has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rus hed to judgment on this issue without hearings and without creating a pro per evidentiary record said AReM Attorney Dan Douglass PUC Commissioner Carl Wood has maintained that the PUC issued the order because it believe d that consumers have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers leaving fewer customers to pay for the states wholesale power costs ARe M is disputing the claim saying that only a limited number of customers s witched suppliers during the summer of Plant Construction Influences Floridas Wholesale Market California based Calpine Corporation announced that it has begun construct ion of a megawatt power plant in Auburndale Florida The construction brings Florida closer to deregulation as Calpine is one of the few outo fstate generating companies to successfully penetrate Floridas wholesale electricity market Other companies such as Enron have attempted to con struct new power plants in the state but have been unsuccessful due to co mmunity and regulatory resistance Floridas stringent Power Plant Siting Act makes it very difficult for outofstate companies to enter the market Calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the Auburndale plant under a longterm contract to one of Floridas existing utilities Seminole Electric Cooperative In addition Calpine has been working with the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity to persuade lawmakers and Governor Bush to deregulate Floridas wholesale market Flor idas Energy Study Commission which is responsible for the states c ompetition plan has endorsed a proposal to allow outofstate companies t o enter Floridas wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe r to the states incumbent utilities The Commission has also suggested el iminating the power of state government to approve power plant development and limiting the ability of local governments to block projects The Comm ission is expected to issue a final report on December Florida PSC Approves Independent Power Line Operations The Florida Public Service Commission PSC has approved the transfer of t he states power lines from utility jurisdiction to an independent company The PSC has asked Floridas three main utilities Florida Power and Ligh t FPL Florida and Power Corporation and Tampa Electric to devise a pr oposal within days that will turn over operation of the power lines to an independent system operator Commissioner Michael A Palecki said that the decision was made in the best interest for ratepayers utility compani es and independent power companies seeking a competitive market Under an earlier proposal submitted to the PSC the utilities proposed a statewide regional transmission organization GridFlorida that would have owned and managed the power lines The PSC did not approve the plan as it would ha ve moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Com mission New England Congressmen Seek Equal Representation on RTO Board Twentythree US congressmen from New England requested that their states be given adequate representation on the governance of the Northeast Regio nal Transmission Organization RTO In an effort organized by Representat ive Edward Markey DMass the bipartisan delegation of congressmen wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC asking the re gulators to create a governing board comprised of equal numbers of represe ntatives from New England New York and the MidAtlantic We view an equ ally balanced governance structure as the only way in which a single marke t design can be implemented which would truly benefit the consumers of all the regions Markey said FERC has been considering several options for structuring the board that will oversee the unified Northeast wholesale po wer market One proposal gives five seats for representatives from the Mid Atlantic three seats to New York and two to New England ISO New Englan d and New York Independent System Operator joined the congressman in oppos ing that plan and requesting equal representation California Wants Consumers to See Real Power Costs In a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of the wholesale electricity market in California the California Consumer Power and Financing Authorit y wants to install electricity meters that charge consumers the real cost of power Currently consumers pay the same price for electricity throughou t the day even though the wholesale price varies every hour Therefore co nsumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times The meters will c harge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours when de mand is highest and less during off peak times The authority issued reque sts for proposals due by November for a minimum of realtime m eters the cost of which varies between and The power authorit y plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to cust omers of Pacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison San Diego Gas Electric and dozens of municipal utilities As consumers have shown to be responsive to price signals in a pilot program in Washington Californi ans too can expect to reduce their energy consumption Project manger Kev in Wood of Southern California Edison hopes his company will install meter s for customers by next summer He said that if these customers wh o represent to percent of the load respond to price signals during peak hours this may in turn drive down wholesale prices for all users Wh ile consumers may benefit the decrease in consumption may cost power gene rators millions of dollars in revenue Environmentalists and Union Coalition Oppose Deregulation in Indiana A coalition of union members from several groups showed their opposition t o electric utility deregulation in Indiana during a peaceful demonstration on November The coalition know as Peoples Energy Campaign includes members from UNITE Local formerly the Ladies Garment Workers Union t he Central Labor Council Valley Watch environmental group and the Citize ns Action Coalition Denny Owen an executive board member of UNITE Local expressed the general concern of the coalition that deregulation shou ld be discouraged We dont think itll make prices lower itll make the m go higher Owen said Indiana is considered to have low utility rates c ompared to other states Indiana lawmakers are considering deregulation as newly introduced legislation proposes to create an Energy Policy Commissi on that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state Senator Gar d and other General Assembly members created the bill to address the state s need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric load growth Merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past year and a half Gard said There are many people who feel if the state has a comprehensive energy policy it might be better able to deal with t his issue And we also have to pay attention to whats happened in Califor nia The bill would set up a temporary commission with appointed members representing various stakeholder groups including state government indust ry labor and environmental groups The commission is scheduled to presen t a final report to the governor in December While electric deregula tion would not be a prime focus of the commission the specter of deregul ation would have to be examined in some fashion Senator Gard said SB has been sent to the Senate Rules and Legislative Procedures Committee Senator Gard predicts it will pass the Senate although chances in the Hou se of Representatives are less favorable Debate Over Oklahoma Transmission Systems Readiness to Serve Future Load The Electric Restructuring Advisory Committee met with industry officials on November to discuss the future capabilities of Oklahomas transmissio n system The committee is responsible for researching the capabilities of the system determining whether upgrades are necessary and delegating th e responsibility for paying for such upgrades With new power plants being developed and proposals to open the state to a competitive electric marke t in progress concern has risen as to whether the transmission system can handle the increased load Stanton Hadley of Oak Ridge National Laborator y reported that electricity demand in Oklahoma is expected to grow perc ent to megawatts by The transmission system currently is abl e to handle only megawatts Nevertheless power companies are plann ing megawatts of new power generation Calpine Corporation is spend ing about million on transmission improvements between its power plant near Coweta Oklahoma and the outlying region Also Public Service Comp any of Oklahoma plans to spend million on transmission upgrades over t he next few years With the new power plants and a supply surplus expected Hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs John Wright o ne of the committee members questioning this

Substitute or Add an email address to our list please send bri ef message to Electricity Restructuring Gets Push From Republicans Republican members of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have agreed with Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTexas that restructuring legislation should move forward now th at Congress has a few more weeks in session In an vote last week Rep ublican Committee members decided to continue drafting electricity restruc turing legislation Electricity restructuring provisions were excluded fro m the energy bill approved by the House earlier this year The issue was to be readdressed in the fall but was delayed due to the events on September th No action has been taken to date in the Senate Green Mountain Energy Expands Into Ohios Restructured Market Green Mountain Energy Company has entered into an agreement with the North east Ohio Public Energy Council NOPEC to service northeastern Ohio with solar and windgenerated electricity NOPEC was formed last year under Ohi os utility deregulation statute Senate Bill which allows local governm ents to serve as aggregators for electricity customers NOPEC consists of local communities with approximately energy customers Under t he agreement Green Mountain Energy will construct a kilowatt solar arr ay at Lake Farmpark in Kirtland Ohio and will conduct a study to determi ne the feasibility of siting a wind generating facility in Ohio The Green Mountain Energy solar array will be the largest in the state and the firs t commercial solar array in Ohio built for the competitive market The pro posed wind study will be the first commercial wind analysis executed solely for the competitive market Debate Over Deregulation Impacts in Oklahoma Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL has reported in a firstofits kind study that restructuring Oklahomas electric industry can benefit consume rs but problems and potential pitfalls do exist The report has been met with some opposition however Pete Churchwell president of Oklahomas sec ond largest electric utility AEPPSO stated on November th that he does not support the studys findings one of which indicates that Oklahomas e nergy costs could rise between and percent if the retail electricity market is opened to competition The study results indicate that lower ele ctric prices may be available in the short term but restructuring will ul timately bring higher prices Under the states restructuring plan existi ng generating plants will have a competitive advantage over new plants Th is advantage will result in higher prices in the long term because newer highercost plants may be forced out of the marketplace Churchwell contes ts that it is too early to know for certain how consumer rates will react in a deregulated market While admitting that the nations grid was not de signed for retail competition Churchwell said that improvements in state transmission systems would allow a successful retail competitive market Utility still looks to be freed of generators Clark Public Utilities has been trying in vain for two months to unload so me of the portable generators that have become a multimilliondollar wh ite elephant The units wired in rows near the River Road Generating Pla nt were leased for a year for million The deal was signed with Gen eral Electric early this year at a time when there were dire predictions about this summers power supply In addition to the equipment lease the re is a million natural gas contract to power the generators and a rou ghly million expense to transport the gas While Clark has been able to resell some of the gas at a loss the transportation costs cant be reco uped For weeks electricity on the open market has been much cheaper tha n that produced by the generators In place since July the generators e ach producing megawatt of power have run for just days Electricity prices have plunged from a high of per megawatthour this summer to less than today The price has to be about to make operating the g enerators feasible So utility officials have had no choice but to let the m sit idle In September the net expense for the generator farm gas gen erator lease and so on was million For no electricity Utility offi cials have tried to get GE to find customers for at least some of the gen erators Tuesday morning Andy Huck Clarks operations director said he had heard from GE about a pretty serious inquiry for two generators for two months And that he said is the best inquiry theyve had so far Now utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending a month for three GE employees and other expenses associated with maint aining the generators The theory is that the equipment should be tested a few at a time to ensure they will be ready if needed They told me t he generators need to be exercised said Huck I told them they spent two months on a ship without being started The units were built in Austr ia GE with a signed oneyear lease in hand has little incentive to fin d customers for the equipment particularly when the company could presuma bly lease other generators from its inventory They say its because we re such good client that an effort has been made to find other users for the generators said Huck Clarks million River Road generating plan t features a giant GE turbine Clark officials dont hold out much hope o f getting out from under the generator lease expense which runs about million per month Where would they go asked Jim Sanders Clarks dir ector of energy resources Meanwhile the natural gas supply for the equi pment is being resold at about half what it cost the utility Gas prices a lso have fallen since the supply deal was inked At their regular Tuesday meeting utility commissioners decided to proceed with a million bon d sale that includes money to pay for the generator lease In March Rick Dyer Clarks finance director recommended that the utility cut a deal f or a oneyear million bond anticipation note The arrangement was made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few months whi ch they have to levels The move Tuesday gave Dyer and utility Gener al Manager Wayne Nelson the OK to approve a bond sale of up to years at percent interest although percent or less is more likely and the goa l is a year term officials said The bond sale likely will occur in t he first week of December The bulk of the million borrowing is to cov er a million power purchase from Kaiser Aluminum The deal like the g enerator lease was for power to cover an AugustSeptember gap in Clarks power supply before the start of a Bonneville Power Administration contra ct That Kaiser purchase was at a megawatthour The utility lost a bid to have a federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a parti al refund AEP Reliant Named as Last Resort Providers in Texas The Texas Public Utility Commission PUC has named American Electric Powe r AEP and Reliant Resources affiliates providers of last resort POLR for residential and smallcommercial customers in all or part of count ies within TXU Electrics service area The POLR becomes the electricity p rovider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider due to payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s area AEP and Reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect January By becoming the POLR AEP and Reliant will acquire an additional milli on Dallasarea customers and an expected percent load increase Due t o the higher costs associated with such an increased load the PUC was agre eable to the higher rate Consumer groups are opposing the higher rates s aying that lowincome consumers will be unfairly hurt Although many lowi ncome consumers will qualify for a percent discount advocates are argui ng that POLR rates should equal the regular rates Studies Show Changing Consumer Views Towards Deregulation A recent study by Deloitte and Touche Energy Resources Group finds that co nsumers are less aware of deregulation in the electric industry and more w ary of its potential benefits The survey considered the opinions of c onsumers nationwide and found that the number of consumers who are aware o f changes in retail electric markets has dropped to percent compared with percent in This is a reversal in a fiveyear trend of inc reasing consumer awareness on deregulation Analysts cited the terrorist a ttacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on deregulation as re asons for the change The survey also found that more consumers expect ele ctric rates to increase with deregulation Deloitte and Touches Brank Ter zi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from competition w hile percent expect prices to go down percent expect improved servic e and percent simply dont know Another study completed by RKS Rese arch and Consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that deregul ation has been a colossal failure Their study found that many consumers who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed because their service expectations were not met RKS Senior Vice President Carmine Grastataro said customers of public power are more satisfied with the j ob their utility is doing than are customers of the IOUs Although this fin ding has historically remained true the difference in performance scores between public power and IOUs is exacerbated in states where competition i s under way The study also found that consumers are more interested in p urchasing power through buying groups voluntary energy curtailment progra ms and onsite generation FERC Postpones December RTO Deadline The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has officially decided to postpone the December deadline for utilities to create four regi onal transmission organizations RTO FERC Chairman Pat Wood said of the decision RTO development is in very different stages in various parts of the country and it is not possible for all RTOs to be in operation by th e December deadline established in Order The commission ha s approved a rulemaking order RM that addresses the development of RTOs in several steps First the Commission will develop a broader defini tion of the expected functions of an RTO and how they can be achieved Sec ond FERC will seek improved input and communication from both state and f ederal agencies on RTO development Third FERC will conduct a formal cost benefit analysis of RTO systems This comes in response to two conflictin g studies NY ISO reports that a large Northeast RTO could cause power rat es to increase by million while Mirant contends that a Northeast RTO could save consumers million The rulemaking also calls for FERC to d etermine areas in which standardization can be improved Lastly a new pr ogressive timeline will be developed that addresses RTO development in a regionbyregion approach While Chairman Wood said that the commission is holding to its original concept of four RTOs he also noted that the new order suggests that three smaller RTOs may be developed within the Western region These transmission groups would include RTO West Desert Star RTO and one based on the California ISO The rulemaking also makes a call fo r comments in what Commissioner Nora Brownell noted as possibly the last o pportunity for market participants and state regulators to make suggestion s and raise concerns before final orders are issued Ontario deregulation in doubt The planned deregulation of the billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the provinc es electricity transmission company preventing it from becoming a signif icant player in an open North American power market The plan known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insider s would turn Hydro One into a notforprofit entity instead of a fully co mmercial privatized company If this happens Hydro One would lack the fl exibility to raise equity capital make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continents premier transmission companies a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe Da vid Lindsay the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBui ld Corp the governments privatization adviser confirmed that turning H ydro One into a notforprofit organization similar to Nav Canada the ci vil air navigation service is under serious consideration Weve been as ked to evaluate all options for Hydro Ones future including this one h e said yesterday He would not provide details though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro Ones future ownership st ructure by the conclusion of the year A senior official in the Ontario go vernment who did not want to be identified said the proposal is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro He was referring to the debtla den utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation the electricity generating arm and Hydro One whose network of highvoltage transmission lines spans kilometres The Premiers office would not comment A s pokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that there are a number of options on the table Sources on Bay Street and at Queens Par k said the idea of turning Hydro One into a notforprofit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell the chairman of Royal Bankowned RBC Dominion Securities Bay Streets largest dealer If the new Hydro One took this sh ape it would raise about billion through the sale of bonds to investo rs The dealers commission on the sale of the bonds which would rank amo ng the biggest debt issues in history would range from million to million one Bay Street executive said Mr Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government t o help pay down the billion in stranded debt racked up by the old On tario Hydro The generating and transmission giants decadeslong spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province s balance sheet Hydro Ones cash flow derived from sales to electricity users would be used to pay the interest on the billion of bonds Pre sumably consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lack ed sufficient cash to pay the interest If Hydro One were a private company instead its financial risk would be borne by shareholders not ratepayer s The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts th e financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan citing client confidentiality concerns Mr Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity marke t in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices by next spring The m arket overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One both of which are per cent owned by the government into commercial companies In Hydro Ones case the leading options were thought to be an outright sale in which the utility would be bought by another company pr esumably a rival utility or an initial public offering where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange The third option converting Hydro One into a notforprofit organization has come as a surprise There has been no debate on this option though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One both of whi ch were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eve ntually become a commercial enterprise Sources said that Hydro One manage ment opposes the notforprofit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business The notf orprofit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes which raises potential trade issues with the United States American transmission comp anies might argue that Hydro Ones nontaxable status gives it an unfair c ompetitive advantage It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options Rod Taylor Hydro Ones executive vicepresident would not comment on the notforprofitoption being conte mplated by the government He said however that the companys strategy h inges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North Ame rican electricity market Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity and become in the transmission sector what Canadian Nat ional is to the rail sector he said in a phone interview Stanley Hartt the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Streets Salomon Smith Barney is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a notforprofit structur e for Hydro One Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro Ones str ategic business plan In a threepage letter sent this week to the top ex ecutives of several large powerusing Ontario companies he said that thi s idea is shortsighted and bad for Ontario He argued that the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the notforprofit corp oration essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers He also said that without financial flexibility Hydro One would lack the resource s to invest in new bottleneckeliminating connections that would allow t he company to become a significant electricity exporter Ontario would lo se the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmiss ion he said In a recent report on the power industry TD Newcrest analy st David McCracken wrote With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmiss ion grids in the northern United States where ownership tends to be fragm ented He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next f ew years and he said the utility has the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive highgrowth initiatives According to sources familiar with the notforprofit proposal Hydro O ne would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by sto cking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are he avy power users such as auto and steel makers and paper companies Such a structure exists at Nav Canada with airline executives on the board and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers Restructu ring Hydro One with debt rather than equity is also presented as the mos t efficient way to capitalize the company The problem with a Canadian Na tional Railstyle IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt sai d one financier familiar with the proposal With a debtbased structure every dollar earned is available to pay interest while an equitybased st ructure means you pay federal taxes provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments Dofasco Inc the big Ontario steel producer that con sumes about million of electricity a year supports the notforprofi t proposal Gord Forstner head of communications said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydros stranded debt by billion immediately paving th e way for lower electricity charges Currently a special levy on all elec tricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt The charge costs Dof asco alone about million a year We want to see the stranded debt pai d down first Mr Forstner said Until that happens we dont favour Hyd ro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontarios boundaries Retail Access Requested in California The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets AReM has asked the California Sup reme Court to overturn the state Public Utilities Commissions September th decision that suspended direct retail access across the state The con sumer group comprised of American Utility Network the Alliance for Retai l Energy Markets California League of Food Processors Western Power Trad ing Forum Strategic Energy ABI Foundry Tricon Global Restaurants and S chool Project for Utility Rate Reduction has argued that the ruling was m ade without due process and that the Court had no right to abrogate contra cts retroactively It is our hope that the Supreme Court recognizes the P UC has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rus hed to judgment on this issue without hearings and without creating a pro per evidentiary record said AReM Attorney Dan Douglass PUC Commissioner Carl Wood has maintained that the PUC issued the order because it believe d that consumers have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers leaving fewer customers to pay for the states wholesale power costs ARe M is disputing the claim saying that only a limited number of customers s witched suppliers during the summer of Plant Construction Influences Floridas Wholesale Market California based Calpine Corporation announced that it has begun construct ion of a megawatt power plant in Auburndale Florida The construction brings Florida closer to deregulation as Calpine is one of the few outo fstate generating companies to successfully penetrate Floridas wholesale electricity market Other companies such as Enron have attempted to con struct new power plants in the state but have been unsuccessful due to co mmunity and regulatory resistance Floridas stringent Power Plant Siting Act makes it very difficult for outofstate companies to enter the market Calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the Auburndale plant under a longterm contract to one of Floridas existing utilities Seminole Electric Cooperative In addition Calpine has been working with the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity to persuade lawmakers and Governor Bush to deregulate Floridas wholesale market Flor idas Energy Study Commission which is responsible for the states c ompetition plan has endorsed a proposal to allow outofstate companies t o enter Floridas wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe r to the states incumbent utilities The Commission has also suggested el iminating the power of state government to approve power plant development and limiting the ability of local governments to block projects The Comm ission is expected to issue a final report on December Florida PSC Approves Independent Power Line Operations The Florida Public Service Commission PSC has approved the transfer of t he states power lines from utility jurisdiction to an independent company The PSC has asked Floridas three main utilities Florida Power and Ligh t FPL Florida and Power Corporation and Tampa Electric to devise a pr oposal within days that will turn over operation of the power lines to an independent system operator Commissioner Michael A Palecki said that the decision was made in the best interest for ratepayers utility compani es and independent power companies seeking a competitive market Under an earlier proposal submitted to the PSC the utilities proposed a statewide regional transmission organization GridFlorida that would have owned and managed the power lines The PSC did not approve the plan as it would ha ve moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Com mission New England Congressmen Seek Equal Representation on RTO Board Twentythree US congressmen from New England requested that their states be given adequate representation on the governance of the Northeast Regio nal Transmission Organization RTO In an effort organized by Representat ive Edward Markey DMass the bipartisan delegation of congressmen wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC asking the re gulators to create a governing board comprised of equal numbers of represe ntatives from New England New York and the MidAtlantic We view an equ ally balanced governance structure as the only way in which a single marke t design can be implemented which would truly benefit the consumers of all the regions Markey said FERC has been considering several options for structuring the board that will oversee the unified Northeast wholesale po wer market One proposal gives five seats for representatives from the Mid Atlantic three seats to New York and two to New England ISO New Englan d and New York Independent System Operator joined the congressman in oppos ing that plan and requesting equal representation California Wants Consumers to See Real Power Costs In a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of the wholesale electricity market in California the California Consumer Power and Financing Authorit y wants to install electricity meters that charge consumers the real cost of power Currently consumers pay the same price for electricity throughou t the day even though the wholesale price varies every hour Therefore co nsumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times The meters will c harge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours when de mand is highest and less during off peak times The authority issued reque sts for proposals due by November for a minimum of realtime m eters the cost of which varies between and The power authorit y plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to cust omers of Pacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison San Diego Gas Electric and dozens of municipal utilities As consumers have shown to be responsive to price signals in a pilot program in Washington Californi ans too can expect to reduce their energy consumption Project manger Kev in Wood of Southern California Edison hopes his company will install meter s for customers by next summer He said that if these customers wh o represent to percent of the load respond to price signals during peak hours this may in turn drive down wholesale prices for all users Wh ile consumers may benefit the decrease in consumption may cost power gene rators millions of dollars in revenue Environmentalists and Union Coalition Oppose Deregulation in Indiana A coalition of union members from several groups showed their opposition t o electric utility deregulation in Indiana during a peaceful demonstration on November The coalition know as Peoples Energy Campaign includes members from UNITE Local formerly the Ladies Garment Workers Union t he Central Labor Council Valley Watch environmental group and the Citize ns Action Coalition Denny Owen an executive board member of UNITE Local expressed the general concern of the coalition that deregulation shou ld be discouraged We dont think itll make prices lower itll make the m go higher Owen said Indiana is considered to have low utility rates c ompared to other states Indiana lawmakers are considering deregulation as newly introduced legislation proposes to create an Energy Policy Commissi on that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state Senator Gar d and other General Assembly members created the bill to address the state s need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric load growth Merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past year and a half Gard said There are many people who feel if the state has a comprehensive energy policy it might be better able to deal with t his issue And we also have to pay attention to whats happened in Califor nia The bill would set up a temporary commission with appointed members representing various stakeholder groups including state government indust ry labor and environmental groups The commission is scheduled to presen t a final report to the governor in December While electric deregula tion would not be a prime focus of the commission the specter of deregul ation would have to be examined in some fashion Senator Gard said SB has been sent to the Senate Rules and Legislative Procedures Committee Senator Gard predicts it will pass the Senate although chances in the Hou se of Representatives are less favorable Debate Over Oklahoma Transmission Systems Readiness to Serve Future Load The Electric Restructuring Advisory Committee met with industry officials on November to discuss the future capabilities of Oklahomas transmissio n system The committee is responsible for researching the capabilities of the system determining whether upgrades are necessary and delegating th e responsibility for paying for such upgrades With new power plants being developed and proposals to open the state to a competitive electric marke t in progress concern has risen as to whether the transmission system can handle the increased load Stanton Hadley of Oak Ridge National Laborator y reported that electricity demand in Oklahoma is expected to grow perc ent to megawatts by The transmission system currently is abl e to handle only megawatts Nevertheless power companies are plann ing megawatts of new power generation Calpine Corporation is spend ing about million on transmission improvements between its power plant near Coweta Oklahoma and the outlying region Also Public Service Comp any of Oklahoma plans to spend million on transmission upgrades over t he next few years With the new power plants and a supply surplus expected Hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs John Wright o ne of the committee members questioning this assumption said that in a de regulated market the utilities are likely to sell their power out of state If this were to occur lower power prices would be unlikely The Electri c Restructuring Advisory
