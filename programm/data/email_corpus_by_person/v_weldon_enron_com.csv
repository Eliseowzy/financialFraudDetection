Martinez MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of The Energy Finance Program years ago was very good especially considerin g it was the first year of the program There were a lot of guest speakers from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou t the energy industry through case studies lectures etc Basically we learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance classes but all the cases and examples were energyrelated The professor s were good for the most part but didnt have a great deal of practical industry experience If I had to guess the reason for decreased participation in the program I would probably say it is the professors Ronn and Titman are great but known as being very technical and quantitative Some students prefer less technical professors and classes that arent limiting to the energy industry Also the fact that the class meets for hours twice a week may not be so appealing Other than those things I cant imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment I especially dont understand why every single person didnt drop for Enron I wonder if it has something to do with international status From John Massey MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of Bottom Line UT Business Schools is great Investment Fund Best Activity available to students Energy Finance program Fairly Weak It was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a weak finance appendage The Finance teacher was pathetic both a poor teacher ignorant about industry specific analysis devoid of industry experience rude to outside lectures from industry Keith Brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small portion of the class time Way to make Better Get teachers with practical industry experience Make it a seminar Class Focus on Case studies lectures given by people from industry Promote the class within the business school I felt like UT did a poor jo b of internally to students promoting the class From Ross Mesquita MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of To be honest a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific When energy applications were presented it seemed more like general financ e questions were reworded to include energy lingo We had some very good speakers but for the most part I did not feel like the hours of class h ad enough energy focus I assumed that this would get better as the program progressed One reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that Energy Finance is a very specific focus I would have probably not enrolled in th e Energy Finance program had it been available in my first year I did not know enough about energy at that time and I had returned to Bschool to consider several career options ie investment banking corporate finance entrepreneurship marketing etc As a new MBA student I would n ot want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies Here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs My interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa From Billy Braddock MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of I was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of The primary positives to the class revolved around outside panelsinstruction For example Enron sent representatives on separate occasions to discuss particular topics Vince Kaminski and Gary Hickerson Other notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer independent business consultant and EP professional the Beacon Group and Encap Investments Another go od speaker was a professor from UTs school of engineering He brought a good perspective as to the basics of the energy business The class was structured via a teambased instruction approach with professors teamteaching a hour credit course None of the professors had any product knowledge of the energy business Of the professors were research focussedtenured with little credibility in teaching One of the professors primary focus of research was fixed income while the other were investments and corporate finance respectively As is the case for UTs finance program in general and energy finance in particular UT is in dire need of teaching professors as opposed to resear ch professors that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a finance background Particular to the energy program UT needs to have mor e instruction from energy professionals such as the instructors used for Enrons internal learning programs ie Derivatives classes etc From Bryan Williams MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of I participated in the first Energy Finance class offered in Fall of a t the University of Texas The curriculum was understandably rough around the edges as wa s the first year the Energy Finance course was offered However the instruction also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak of The credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors Two of the three professors have coauthored textbooks and the third professors claim to fame is fixed income As a group the three profes sors are researchheavy as opposed to industry focused and the teamteaching format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for the success of the class That said the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside speakers Among them Vince Kaminski Gary Hickerson both of Enron They also dedicated one class period to a video conference call with the Beacon Group an energy consulti ng group that I believe was recently acquired by Goldman Jeff Sandefer an independent businessman an entreprenuership instructor and one of the foremost experts in the EP sector also spoke to the class Jeff was joined by some of the executives from Houstonbased Encap The woes of the Energy Finance could be easily remedied by injecting some instruction from someone from industry The class is too academictheoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the ener gy sector The instructors Enron uses for the Derivatives courses taught internally ar e good examples of people who can package very relevant information and successfully articulate it in a couple of days Perhaps a similar approach would bode well for the Energy Finance program at UT From Yuan Tian MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of Here are my thoughts on the UT Energy Finance Program Pros more focused on the Finance studies in the Energy Industry which is right now in a transition period from regulation to deregulation and thus is exposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries there are some experienced brandname professors eg Sheridan Titman teaching in the program Cons the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies such as Enron Specifically it might need to help students link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as Enron From George Huan MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of Companies expect MBA students to have both general management new ideas a nd analytic quantative skills Energy industry is no exception Energy Finance Program offers Financial Strategy and Risk Managements cours es which fit in the insudtry need However these two courses are far from enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitements and opportunities in this industry Other management and quantitive courses are needed to complete this program My suggestions Seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies Before students make their decisions let them know Whats happening and whats going to happen in this industry What the companies are doing now Who they are looking for Management andor analytical courses should be included Such as Strategy Financial enginering and Real Option More industry connections Presentations and discussions From Charlie Weldon MBA Class of Energy Finance taken in fall of My experience in the Energy Finance program overall was a positive experience The most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers brought in during Dr Titmans portion of the class This part of the cour se is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of case classes all focusing on the Energy industry Two of the cases were based o n Enron and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an d well thought out Value added by the professor was less than from the speakers and cases The first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options Nearly a ll of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the students understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market The u se of options and futures for speculating andor hedging was stressed on numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project I believe that the University Energy Finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvements to the program However I do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement There is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivatives similar to the course taught by Paradigm here at Enron The focus of the University teachers is quite theoretical due in large par t to their background While the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi ng the basics the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course Until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience I believe the Energy Finance program will continue to underdeliver on its objectives Additionally I believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having consecutive hours of classroom instruction

taught internally ar e good examples of people who can package very relevant information and successfully articulate it in a couple of days Perhaps a similar approach would bode well for the Energy Finance program at UT From Yuan Tian MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of Here are my thoughts on the UT Energy Finance Program Pros more focused on the Finance studies in the Energy Industry which is right now in a transition period from regulation to deregulation and thus is exposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries there are some experienced brandname professors eg Sheridan Titman teaching in the program Cons the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies such as Enron Specifically it might need to help students link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as Enron From George Huan MBA class of Energy Finance taken fall of Companies expect MBA students to have both general management new ideas a nd analytic quantative skills Energy industry is no exception Energy Finance Program offers Financial Strategy and Risk Managements cours es which fit in the insudtry need However these two courses are far from enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitements and opportunities in this industry Other management and quantitive courses are needed to complete this program My suggestions Seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies Before students make their decisions let them know Whats happening and whats going to happen in this industry What the companies are doing now Who they are looking for Management andor analytical courses should be included Such as Strategy Financial enginering and Real Option More industry connections Presentations and discussions From Charlie Weldon MBA Class of Energy Finance taken in fall of My experience in the Energy Finance program overall was a positive experience The most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers brought in during Dr Titmans portion of the class This part of the cour se is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of case classes all focusing on the Energy industry Two of the cases were based o n Enron and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an d well thought out Value added by the professor was less than from the speakers and cases The first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options Nearly a ll of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the students understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market The u se of options and futures for speculating andor hedging was stressed on numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project I believe that the University Energy Finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvements to the program However I do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement There is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivatives similar to the course taught by Paradigm here at Enron The focus of the University teachers is quite theoretical due in large par t to their background While the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi ng the basics the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course Until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience I believe the Energy Finance program will continue to underdeliver on its objectives Additionally I believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having consecutive hours of classroom instruction

revenue Several years can go buy waiting for recovery Unfavorable volume and raw material costs are hurting near term Growth slowed down some time back Its unlikely to resume Industry mix continues to shift slowly towards Nylon in which DD is a tiny regional player vs Nylon Further growth is in Asia not a DuPont strong hold BACKING OUT OF APPAREL OR CARPET WILL BE TRICKY Its not even clear DuPont is serous about this option In any event it will be difficult to find buyers for just the fiber SPINNING operation if they will need to buy raw materials from duPont Further nylon does provide critical mass to the large apparel effort picking up cost allocations that otherwise may need to be shouldered by Lycra Another problem All nylon producers seem to want to exit the fiber spinning step Solutia Honeywell DuPont Makes one wonder about the potential disposition value SHUTTING DOWN IS NOT AN OPTION There is incremental profit in the intermediate step and that would be lost AApparel is nearly of the nylon polymer outlet and without it the scale of operations is hurt BApparel nylon is a very large part of duPonts apparel business which after automotive is the largest end market Likewise engineered polymers make up a large part of the nylon family though DD books revenue and profit for these under its coatingspolymers segment Shrinking the rest of nylon would hurt profitability of the engineered plastics area The rest of nylon picks up overhead DuPont seems to be forced to keep a large chunk of nylon because of its presence in Engineered plastics and Lycra iLycra is largely an apparel business The bn Lycra has been a high margin business Its growth has slowed and competitive position is slipping Yet DD is increasing its commitment to Lycra The problem is that the Lycra franchise encourages a greater commitment to apparel nylon than otherwise Apparel nylon is of the nylon div revenue iiThe bn engineered plastics business has nylon resin as its flagship This is NOT included in the nylon division Likewise polyester engineered plastic is not included in the polyester div Part of the competitive advantage in the plastic comes from a low cost position in raw materials in turn partly based on scale iiiDD seems to like its nylon ingredients business In our view its ok not a growth vehicle The combination of the interest in Lycra nylon intermediates and engineered plastics means DD is forced to keep nylon carpet of div and apparel These end markets dont make as much money and are more vulnerable But they provide over of the outlet for the intermediates and their sheer volume helps provide greater scale and lower cost SO THE NYLON PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED ROC has been poor How will that improve Asset monetization has been small Growth has been low How will that change If anything US consumer spending is slowing The competitive edge is not increasing it could actually be slipping just a bit as a powerful new competitor GE

powerful trading platform into the hear t of the new economy Enron NYSE ENE President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling hates his office a spacious lair on the th floor of the energy companys downtown Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain To Skilling its haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mindset from the days when energy markets were highly regulated Instead he prefers strolling through Enrons three commoditytrading floors the companys nerve centers where it buys an d sells products ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth The often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the traders Thats how you find out whats going on he says Skilling doesnt think like an oldline energy executive nor does Enron ac t like an oldline energy company With its eclectic product mix and strong online presence Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin g to capitalize on deregulation The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas and electric power markets that began in the mids has left both industries in a tizzy A dearth of new power supplies combined with insatiable demand has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and their customers That suits Enron just fine New Economy Initiatives The company which years ago earned some percent of its profits from its regulated gaspipeline business has become the nations largest buyer and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities But what ha s really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enrons neweconomy initiatives First it launched EnronOnline an Internetbased energytradi ng system in November By midOctober the new venture had executed more than transactions with a gross value totaling billion Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both delivering content along its own sizable fiberoptic network and trading bandwidth as a commodity The nascent broadband services group had million in revenue for the first nine months of this year Although energy remains Enrons main source of revenue and earnings management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t ap into new markets In five years we will be a substantially different company says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay Underlying everything we do is the ability to make markets more efficient Along with bandwidth Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel and pulp and paper to it s trading platform which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips and data storage Trading is the ultimate scalable concept adds Skilling Were using the same computer systems processes controls and people The potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited Investors have bought into Enrons vision and sent its shares soaring whic h at a recent price of were up percent since the beginning of Th e big question of course is how much of that euphoria is already built into Enrons stock price and what happens if the companys broadband strategy doesnt unfold as quickly or become as huge as the company anticipates We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly suited for the changing economy Jeff Skilling President and COO Enron Company Culture Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission From management down employees have little doubt that theyre creating revolutionary new businesses This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at Enrons headquarters where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a tickertape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enrons stock price Management Ken Lay assumed the top job at Enron in February not long after the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas where he had been chairman and CEO The two pipeline companies had joined forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being deregulated In the past government authorities set the price that utiliti es could charge for gas and customers were bound by rigid longterm contract s But with deregulation the market determines energy prices and both suppliers and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods The new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating a trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers Enron repeated the process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market in the s Lay has long been hailed as Enrons visionary but COO Skilling is no slouc h Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people Ive ever known sa ys Lay who began working with him in the mids when Skilling was a McKinsey consultant helping Enron develop its gastrading system Ive made it clea r for some time that hes my successor The yearold Skilling who officiall y joined Enron in likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when describing the companys business Lays language is slightly less colorfu l but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enrons future Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the bottom Weve flattened the organization made it more entrepreneurial an d developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas Lay says Take Michae l Moulton who is working in Enrons pulpandpaper trading unit Moulton came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips and when the new uni t begins its operations later this year he will run it Wholesale Energy Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations Enron is still at its core an energy company During the first nine months of this year nearly billion of its billion in revenue came from its wholesale energy operation which centers around making markets in and creating riskmanagement products for natural gas and electricity Some of what Enron sells comes fr om its own gas production and electricpower generation but the bulk of it is bought from other energy producers with excess capacity The companys trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from EnronOnline which now handles about percent of its transaction volume Margins are razorthin maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt of electricity standard contract measures But Enron isnt doing trades just to make money it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable it to package together riskmanagement products such as futures and swap contracts that companies can use to hedge their energy costs Enron is a principal in every trade taking full responsibility for actual delivery of the product be it gas electricity or even pulp and paper Overall margins in the wholesale energy business average one to three percent Trading is a risky business of course but few companies manage risk bette r than Enron which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri ce moves Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best modeling systems hires the brightest people and has trading experience throughout the country says Gregory Phelps a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund s who closely follows the utilities sector Enron employs a dozen meteorologists on its gastrading floor to monitor any weather changes from an oncomi ng cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico th at could affect supply and demand Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe which is in the early stages of deregulation Enron established a presence in the UK Germany and Scandinavia in the early to mids It currently has offices in countries making markets and hedging risks in a region where stateowned utilities still loom large and national differences present formidable hurdles Were the only company wi th panEuropean operations says Mark Frevert who heads the wholesale energy unit Theres a lot of complexity but we like markets where its difficult Broadband Operations The roots of Enrons bandwidth trading go back to when the company bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ y market At the time the utility was laying fiberoptic cable alongside it s gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City and as it was being deployed the Enron mindset of Can we trade this stuff kicked in says Kenneth Rice CEO of Enron Broadband Services Bandwidth lends itself well to bein g traded like a commodity Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from carriers such as ATT NYSE T Global Crossing NYSE GX and Qwest NYSE Q As it does with energy Enron bundles together bandwidth then sells and delivers it on an asneeded basis to content providers network carriers and other endusers Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and for a specified period over a fiberoptic network that stretches nearly miles and connects some major cities in the United States Europeand Japan Enron is certainly ambitious It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold which up until now has been in fixedrate monthly contracts that lock buyer s into paying for capacity they dont always need Enron provides bandwidth on demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period s of time for instance if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o f its CEO to its offices around the globe The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a monthly contract for DS bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o n a Global Crossing network DS is an industry standard for moving data at a speed of megabits per second fast enough for streaming video Enron delivered months worth of DS broadband capacity in the third quarter alone and is on target to meet its yearend goal of DS months Both Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute billion in annual operating profits in five years or nearly as much as wholesale ener gy contributed in Meanwhile the company expects to pour another million into broadband services during each of the next two years offset by the pending billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The other major piece of Enrons broadband strategy centers on delivering streaming video Using Sun Microsystems Nasdaq SUNW servers and switches made by Lucent Technologies NYSE LU and Cisco Systems Nasdaq CSCO along with its own internally developed software Enrons broadband system is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams Content customers ran ge from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster NYS E BBI which this summer inked a year deal to distribute videoondemand over Enrons network Video will be the king application Skilling says That s where its all going to happen Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enrons decision to plunk down million for the year naming rights to Enron Field the Houston Astros new retractabledome baseball stadium But the deal also helped Enron seal a year million agreement to outsource the energy management of the stadium So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made million in the process Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market considering that US businesses spend more than billion on heat and electricity to run thei r operations every year Enter Enron Energy Services which does everything from analyzing a companys energy supply chain to pinpointing its energyguzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying moreefficient gear The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group NYSE SPG before making recommendations that landed it a year billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simons realestate properties The complexity of this business is so enormous that if youre going to be the leader youve got to know every detail says Marty Sunde head of the groups North American unit Energy savings can be significant Enron guarantees eight to percent bu t sometimes the savings can be even greater The business which began in recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT of million this year Enron is on target to land billion in customer contracts in double last years total Theres no reason this business cant roughly double in each of the next f ew years Lay says Enron is very very confident Their tone borders on excessive confidence but their track record warrants that Erik Gustafson Senior Portfolio Manager Stein Roe Farnham The Competition Some of Enrons trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t he deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications Dynegy NYSE DYN located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a nd called Enron Jr by at least one analyst has its own gas and electricitytrading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading The same goes for Williams Companies NYSE WMB whose fiberoptic network is much larger than Enrons A consortium of six energy companies including Aquila Energy a leading power marketer just launched an online energytrading system to rival EnronOnline Several existing bandwidth traders including ArbinetthexchangeRateXchang e AMEX RTX and BandX essentially provide Webbased bulletin boards for companies to find trading partners They dont actually deliver the product which Enron feels gives it an advantage In the energyservices business Enron competes with a whole host of players including consultants regiona l utilities and energy outsourcers but none have Enrons geographic scope Its a challenge to value Enrons stock because its such a hybrid It always seems expensive but it continues to outperform expectations Zach Wagner Analyst Edward D Jones Co What Its Worth Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along its four reported business lines using a sumoftheparts model They also typically value the companys businesses in terms of EBIT judging tha t to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enrons income because its business es are so capital intensive Using those metrics and a recent stock price of Enrons pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly valued at wholesale energy at energy services at and broadband services at Skilling believes the multiple of times EBIT assigned to wholesale energy is too low considering that business is expected to grow percent this year to billion some percent of Enrons projected total EBIT And wholesale energys EBIT growth is likely to exceed percent annually for at least t he next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy markets Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and broadband not to mention the potential for new commoditytrading markets and Skilli ng argues Enrons stock is easily worth Analysts are more cautious Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay but bandwidth i s still a couple of years away from profitability In the meantime Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market potential of bandwidth trading and that the quick acceptance of this product in the market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the mids Niles thinks Enrons overall energy operations alone are worth more than Enrons current share price If thats true tacking on the EBIT value for bandwidth would make Enron a stock Ultimately many investors will look at plain old earnings per share If Enron meets analysts consensus earnings forecast of a share next yea r and maintains its current multiple of times earnings it would be worth Social Responsibility Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce methane emissions and has been applauded for its windpower division But certain Enron projects such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant in India have been mired in controversy The state police there squelched protests against the plant in and with beatings and jailings and Human Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th e suppression of dissent and didnt speak out against human rights violations Enron has since built a bed hospital in the area and committed to improve the communitys water and sanitation infrastructures The Upside With less than half of the residential power market in the US open to competition electricity deregulation is far from over Some analysts belie ve the entire market will be deregulated within five years This would enable Enron to expand its leading energytrading business On the retail side Enron could get a boost from the New Power Company a partnership it formed with AOL NYSE AOL and IBM NYSE IBM aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via the Internet Enrons attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi a ended in failure in and the company readily admits this isnt one of its strengths So its relying on IBMs backoffice expertise to handle the paperwork and AOLs Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power The Downside The muchballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations Currently only five percent of US households have broadband access and Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of socalled lastmile connections which take broadband signals into homes is moving very slowly She doesnt expect widescale availability of videoondemand befor e Who Needs It Enrons mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most conservative investors Its energy trading and pipeline businesses give it a stable source of cash flow while its new Internetbased ventures give it t he great growth potential of a tech stock

yet regarding Asian and US intermediates and PET resin They are making money at present but are not industryleading assets and the value continues to erode with time IMPLICATION This asset was impaired enough that it could not be disposed of in one swoop It has ended up requiring multiple painstakingly crafted deals each tiny for a company duPonts size NYLON IS INTERTWINED WITH OTHER

decade late in the minds of some at little value Meanwhile competitive advantage is eroding slowly iMaturity allows others to close the gap iiCustomers have gotten stronger especially in carpet of div revenue Several years can go buy waiting for recovery Unfavorable volume and raw material costs are hurting near term Growth slowed down some time back Its unlikely to resume Industry mix continues to shift slowly towards Nylon in which DD is a tiny regional player vs Nylon Further growth is in Asia not a DuPont strong hold BACKING OUT OF APPAREL OR CARPET WILL BE TRICKY Its not even clear DuPont is serous about this option In any event it will be difficult to find buyers for just the fiber SPINNING operation if they will need to buy raw materials from duPont Further nylon does provide critical mass to the large apparel effort picking up cost allocations that otherwise may need to be shouldered by Lycra Another problem All nylon producers seem to want to exit the fiber spinning step Solutia Honeywell DuPont Makes one wonder about the potential disposition value SHUTTING DOWN IS NOT AN OPTION There is incremental profit in the intermediate step and that would be lost AApparel is nearly of the nylon polymer outlet and without it the scale of operations is hurt BApparel nylon is a very large part of duPonts apparel business which after automotive is the largest end market Likewise engineered polymers make up a large part of the nylon family though DD books revenue and profit for these under its coatingspolymers segment Shrinking the rest of nylon would hurt profitability of the engineered plastics area The rest of nylon picks up overhead DuPont seems to be forced to keep a large chunk of nylon because of its presence in Engineered plastics and Lycra iLycra is largely an apparel business The bn Lycra has been a high margin business Its growth has slowed and competitive position is slipping Yet DD is increasing its commitment to Lycra The problem is that the Lycra franchise encourages a greater commitment to apparel nylon than otherwise Apparel nylon is of the nylon div revenue iiThe bn engineered plastics business has nylon resin as its flagship This is NOT included in the nylon division Likewise polyester engineered plastic is not included in the polyester div Part of the competitive advantage in the plastic comes from a low cost position in raw materials in turn partly based on scale iiiDD seems to like its nylon ingredients business In our view its ok not a growth vehicle The combination of the interest in Lycra nylon intermediates and engineered plastics means DD is forced to keep nylon carpet of div and apparel These end markets dont make as much money and are more vulnerable But they provide over of the outlet for the intermediates and their sheer volume helps provide greater scale and lower cost SO THE NYLON PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED ROC has been poor How will that improve Asset monetization has been small

powerful trading platform into the hear t of the new economy Enron NYSE ENE President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling hates his office a spacious lair on the th floor of the energy companys downtown Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain To Skilling its haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mindset from the days when energy markets were highly regulated Instead he prefers strolling through Enrons three commoditytrading floors the companys nerve centers where it buys an d sells products ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth The often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the traders Thats how you find out whats going on he says Skilling doesnt think like an oldline energy executive nor does Enron ac t like an oldline energy company With its eclectic product mix and strong online presence Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin g to capitalize on deregulation The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas and electric power markets that began in the mids has left both industries in a tizzy A dearth of new power supplies combined with insatiable demand has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and their customers That suits Enron just fine New Economy Initiatives The company which years ago earned some percent of its profits from its regulated gaspipeline business has become the nations largest buyer and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities But what ha s really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enrons neweconomy initiatives First it launched EnronOnline an Internetbased energytradi ng system in November By midOctober the new venture had executed more than transactions with a gross value totaling billion Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both delivering content along its own sizable fiberoptic network and trading bandwidth as a commodity The nascent broadband services group had million in revenue for the first nine months of this year Although energy remains Enrons main source of revenue and earnings management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t ap into new markets In five years we will be a substantially different company says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay Underlying everything we do is the ability to make markets more efficient Along with bandwidth Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel and pulp and paper to it s trading platform which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips and data storage Trading is the ultimate scalable concept adds Skilling Were using the same computer systems processes controls and people The potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited Investors have bought into Enrons vision and sent its shares soaring whic h at a recent price of were up percent since the beginning of Th e big question of course is how much of that euphoria is already built into Enrons stock price and what happens if the companys broadband strategy doesnt unfold as quickly or become as huge as the company anticipates We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly suited for the changing economy Jeff Skilling President and COO Enron Company Culture Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission From management down employees have little doubt that theyre creating revolutionary new businesses This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at Enrons headquarters where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a tickertape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enrons stock price Management Ken Lay assumed the top job at Enron in February not long after the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas where he had been chairman and CEO The two pipeline companies had joined forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being deregulated In the past government authorities set the price that utiliti es could charge for gas and customers were bound by rigid longterm contract s But with deregulation the market determines energy prices and both suppliers and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods The new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating a trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers Enron repeated the process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market in the s Lay has long been hailed as Enrons visionary but COO Skilling is no slouc h Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people Ive ever known sa ys Lay who began working with him in the mids when Skilling was a McKinsey consultant helping Enron develop its gastrading system Ive made it clea r for some time that hes my successor The yearold Skilling who officiall y joined Enron in likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when describing the companys business Lays language is slightly less colorfu l but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enrons future Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the bottom Weve flattened the organization made it more entrepreneurial an d developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas Lay says Take Michae l Moulton who is working in Enrons pulpandpaper trading unit Moulton came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips and when the new uni t begins its operations later this year he will run it Wholesale Energy Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations Enron is still at its core an energy company During the first nine months of this year nearly billion of its billion in revenue came from its wholesale energy operation which centers around making markets in and creating riskmanagement products for natural gas and electricity Some of what Enron sells comes fr om its own gas production and electricpower generation but the bulk of it is bought from other energy producers with excess capacity The companys trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from EnronOnline which now handles about percent of its transaction volume Margins are razorthin maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt of electricity standard contract measures But Enron isnt doing trades just to make money it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable it to package together riskmanagement products such as futures and swap contracts that companies can use to hedge their energy costs Enron is a principal in every trade taking full responsibility for actual delivery of the product be it gas electricity or even pulp and paper Overall margins in the wholesale energy business average one to three percent Trading is a risky business of course but few companies manage risk bette r than Enron which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri ce moves Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best modeling systems hires the brightest people and has trading experience throughout the country says Gregory Phelps a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund s who closely follows the utilities sector Enron employs a dozen meteorologists on its gastrading floor to monitor any weather changes from an oncomi ng cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico th at could affect supply and demand Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe which is in the early stages of deregulation Enron established a presence in the UK Germany and Scandinavia in the early to mids It currently has offices in countries making markets and hedging risks in a region where stateowned utilities still loom large and national differences present formidable hurdles Were the only company wi th panEuropean operations says Mark Frevert who heads the wholesale energy unit Theres a lot of complexity but we like markets where its difficult Broadband Operations The roots of Enrons bandwidth trading go back to when the company bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ y market At the time the utility was laying fiberoptic cable alongside it s gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City and as it was being deployed the Enron mindset of Can we trade this stuff kicked in says Kenneth Rice CEO of Enron Broadband Services Bandwidth lends itself well to bein g traded like a commodity Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from carriers such as ATT NYSE T Global Crossing NYSE GX and Qwest NYSE Q As it does with energy Enron bundles together bandwidth then sells and delivers it on an asneeded basis to content providers network carriers and other endusers Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and for a specified period over a fiberoptic network that stretches nearly miles and connects some major cities in the United States Europeand Japan Enron is certainly ambitious It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold which up until now has been in fixedrate monthly contracts that lock buyer s into paying for capacity they dont always need Enron provides bandwidth on demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period s of time for instance if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o f its CEO to its offices around the globe The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a monthly contract for DS bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o n a Global Crossing network DS is an industry standard for moving data at a speed of megabits per second fast enough for streaming video Enron delivered months worth of DS broadband capacity in the third quarter alone and is on target to meet its yearend goal of DS months Both Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute billion in annual operating profits in five years or nearly as much as wholesale ener gy contributed in Meanwhile the company expects to pour another million into broadband services during each of the next two years offset by the pending billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The other major piece of Enrons broadband strategy centers on delivering streaming video Using Sun Microsystems Nasdaq SUNW servers and switches made by Lucent Technologies NYSE LU and Cisco Systems Nasdaq CSCO along with its own internally developed software Enrons broadband system is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams Content customers ran ge from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster NYS E BBI which this summer inked a year deal to distribute videoondemand over Enrons network Video will be the king application Skilling says That s where its all going to happen Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enrons decision to plunk down million for the year naming rights to Enron Field the Houston Astros new retractabledome baseball stadium But the deal also helped Enron seal a year million agreement to outsource the energy management of the stadium So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made million in the process Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market considering that US businesses spend more than billion on heat and electricity to run thei r operations every year Enter Enron Energy Services which does everything from analyzing a companys energy supply chain to pinpointing its energyguzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying moreefficient gear The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group NYSE SPG before making recommendations that landed it a year billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simons realestate properties The complexity of this business is so enormous that if youre going to be the leader youve got to know every detail says Marty Sunde head of the groups North American unit Energy savings can be significant Enron guarantees eight to percent bu t sometimes the savings can be even greater The business which began in recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT of million this year Enron is on target to land billion in customer contracts in double last years total Theres no reason this business cant roughly double in each of the next f ew years Lay says Enron is very very confident Their tone borders on excessive confidence but their track record warrants that Erik Gustafson Senior Portfolio Manager Stein Roe Farnham The Competition Some of Enrons trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t he deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications Dynegy NYSE DYN located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a nd called Enron Jr by at least one analyst has its own gas and electricitytrading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading The same goes for Williams Companies NYSE WMB whose fiberoptic network is much larger than Enrons A consortium of six energy companies including Aquila Energy a leading power marketer just launched an online energytrading system to rival EnronOnline Several existing bandwidth traders including ArbinetthexchangeRateXchang e AMEX RTX and BandX essentially provide Webbased bulletin boards for companies to find trading partners They dont actually deliver the product which Enron feels gives it an advantage In the energyservices business Enron competes with a whole host of players including consultants regiona l utilities and energy outsourcers but none have Enrons geographic scope Its a challenge to value Enrons stock because its such a hybrid It always seems expensive but it continues to outperform expectations Zach Wagner Analyst Edward D Jones Co What Its Worth Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along its four reported business lines using a sumoftheparts model They also typically value the companys businesses in terms of EBIT judging tha t to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enrons income because its business es are so capital intensive Using those metrics and a recent stock price of Enrons pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly valued at wholesale energy at energy services at and broadband services at Skilling believes the multiple of times EBIT assigned to wholesale energy is too low considering that business is expected to grow percent this year to billion some percent of Enrons projected total EBIT And wholesale energys EBIT growth is likely to exceed percent annually for at least t he next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy markets Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and broadband not to mention the potential for new commoditytrading markets and Skilli ng argues Enrons stock is easily worth Analysts are more cautious Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay but bandwidth i s still a couple of years away from profitability In the meantime Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market potential of bandwidth trading and that the quick acceptance of this product in the market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the mids Niles thinks Enrons overall energy operations alone are worth more than Enrons current share price If thats true tacking on the EBIT value for bandwidth would make Enron a stock Ultimately many investors will look at plain old earnings per share If Enron meets analysts consensus earnings forecast of a share next yea r and maintains its current multiple of times earnings it would be worth Social Responsibility Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce methane emissions and has been applauded for its windpower division But certain Enron projects such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant in India have been mired in controversy The state police there squelched protests against the plant in and with beatings and jailings and Human Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th e suppression of dissent and didnt speak out against human rights violations Enron has since built a bed hospital in the area and committed to improve the communitys water and sanitation infrastructures The Upside With less than half of the residential power market in the US open to competition electricity deregulation is far from over Some analysts belie ve the entire market will be deregulated within five years This would enable Enron to expand its leading energytrading business On the retail side Enron could get a boost from the New Power Company a partnership it formed with AOL NYSE AOL and IBM NYSE IBM aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via the Internet Enrons attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi a ended in failure in and the company readily admits this isnt one of its strengths So its relying on IBMs backoffice expertise to handle the paperwork and AOLs Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power The Downside The muchballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations Currently only five percent of US households have broadband access and Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of socalled lastmile connections which take broadband signals into homes is moving very slowly She doesnt expect widescale availability of videoondemand befor e Who Needs It Enrons mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most conservative investors Its energy trading and pipeline businesses give it a stable source of cash flow while its new Internetbased ventures give it t he great growth potential of a tech stock

Polymers segment The above excludes nonwovens and KevlarNomax businesses since they are more stand alones with less overlap between them and nylonpolyester POLYESTER AN IMPAIRED ASSET IS BEING DEALT WITH PIECEMEAL The combined value is unlikely to exceed billion We estimate billion Revenue Americas Europe Asia mn Mid East Films duPontTeijin global joint venture Staple Alfa Sabanci Filament Unifi Sabanci Resin Sabanci Intermediates Sabanci DuPont has a put option years hence that can force Unifi to buy the American filament assets within a predetermined price range There is no clear solution yet regarding Asian and US intermediates and PET resin They are making money at present but are not industryleading assets and the value continues to erode with time IMPLICATION This asset was impaired enough that it could not be disposed of in one swoop It has ended up requiring multiple painstakingly crafted deals each tiny for a company duPonts size NYLON IS INTERTWINED WITH OTHER DIVISIONS COMPLICATES SOLUTION Note the role of nylon in duPonts appareltextile and in engineered plastics businesses End Markets Nylon Lycra Polyester Others DDs total revenue mn for end mkt Intermediates NA NA NA Carpet Industrial NA NA NA Apparel textile Engg plastics Total NA DUPONTS NYLON ACTION TODATE HAS BEEN MINISCULE BUT IS A CLUE TO ITS THINKING ACTION TODATE partially disposed of half of the mn industrial nylon business But this RECENT NYLON JV DIVESTITURE IS TINY DuPont has consolidated several JVs with Sabanci in a tiny part of nylon heavy denier industrial nylon This was barely over mn in revenue The inclusion of Sabancis assets raises the revenue but netnet this is a tiny business DuPont is actually divesting part ownership since Sabancis contribution is smaller CLUES ADuPont is reluctant to part with the bulk of the nylon business It doesnt seem ready to let this business go yet It may want to unload the carpet spinning or apparel fiber business but not the associated intermediates production NYLONS WEAK LINKS ARE INDUSTRIAL PART AND APPAREL THE LATTER HAS NO EASY FIX IN OUR VIEW STAYING IN APPAREL nylon will be painful DD HAS SAID IT WILL RELATIVELY DEEMPHASIZE THE BUSINESS in the long run such a strategy is tough to implement without impairing the business better to exit Witness what happened to the polyester chain where disposition is coming a decade late in the minds of some at little value Meanwhile competitive advantage is eroding slowly iMaturity allows others to close the gap iiCustomers have gotten stronger especially in carpet of div revenue Several years can go buy waiting for recovery Unfavorable volume and raw material costs are hurting near term Growth slowed down some time back Its unlikely to resume Industry mix continues to shift slowly towards Nylon in which DD is a tiny regional player vs Nylon Further growth is in Asia not a DuPont strong hold BACKING OUT OF APPAREL OR CARPET WILL BE TRICKY Its not even clear DuPont is serous about this option In any event it will be difficult to find buyers for just the fiber SPINNING operation if they will need to buy raw materials from duPont Further nylon does provide critical mass to the large apparel effort picking up cost allocations that otherwise may need to be shouldered by Lycra Another problem All nylon producers seem to want to exit the fiber spinning step Solutia Honeywell DuPont Makes one wonder about the potential disposition value SHUTTING DOWN IS NOT AN OPTION There is incremental profit in the intermediate step and that would be lost AApparel is nearly of the nylon polymer outlet and without it the scale of operations is hurt BApparel nylon is a very large part of duPonts apparel business which after automotive is the largest end market Likewise engineered polymers make up a large part of the nylon family though DD books revenue and profit for these under its coatingspolymers segment Shrinking the rest of nylon would hurt profitability of the engineered plastics area The rest of nylon picks up overhead DuPont seems to be forced to keep a large chunk of nylon because of its presence in Engineered plastics and Lycra iLycra is largely an apparel business The bn Lycra has been a high margin business Its growth has slowed and competitive position is slipping Yet DD is increasing its commitment to Lycra The problem is that the Lycra franchise encourages a greater commitment to apparel nylon than otherwise Apparel nylon is of the nylon div revenue iiThe bn engineered plastics business has nylon resin as its flagship This is NOT included in the nylon division Likewise polyester engineered plastic is not included in the polyester div Part of the competitive advantage in the plastic comes from a low cost position in raw materials in turn partly based on scale iiiDD seems to like its nylon ingredients business In our view its ok not a growth vehicle The combination of the interest in Lycra nylon intermediates and engineered plastics means DD is forced to keep nylon carpet of div and apparel These end markets dont make as much money and are more vulnerable But they provide over of the outlet for the intermediates and their sheer volume helps provide greater scale and lower cost SO THE NYLON PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED ROC has been poor How will that improve Asset monetization has been small Growth has been low How will that change If anything US consumer spending is slowing The competitive edge is not increasing it could actually be slipping just a bit as a powerful new competitor GE

powerful trading platform into the hear t of the new economy Enron NYSE ENE President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling hates his office a spacious lair on the th floor of the energy companys downtown Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain To Skilling its haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mindset from the days when energy markets were highly regulated Instead he prefers strolling through Enrons three commoditytrading floors the companys nerve centers where it buys an d sells products ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth The often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the traders Thats how you find out whats going on he says Skilling doesnt think like an oldline energy executive nor does Enron ac t like an oldline energy company With its eclectic product mix and strong online presence Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin g to capitalize on deregulation The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas and electric power markets that began in the mids has left both industries in a tizzy A dearth of new power supplies combined with insatiable demand has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and their customers That suits Enron just fine New Economy Initiatives The company which years ago earned some percent of its profits from its regulated gaspipeline business has become the nations largest buyer and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities But what ha s really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enrons neweconomy initiatives First it launched EnronOnline an Internetbased energytradi ng system in November By midOctober the new venture had executed more than transactions with a gross value totaling billion Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both delivering content along its own sizable fiberoptic network and trading bandwidth as a commodity The nascent broadband services group had million in revenue for the first nine months of this year Although energy remains Enrons main source of revenue and earnings management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t ap into new markets In five years we will be a substantially different company says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay Underlying everything we do is the ability to make markets more efficient Along with bandwidth Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel and pulp and paper to it s trading platform which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips and data storage Trading is the ultimate scalable concept adds Skilling Were using the same computer systems processes controls and people The potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited Investors have bought into Enrons vision and sent its shares soaring whic h at a recent price of were up percent since the beginning of Th e big question of course is how much of that euphoria is already built into Enrons stock price and what happens if the companys broadband strategy doesnt unfold as quickly or become as huge as the company anticipates We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly suited for the changing economy Jeff Skilling President and COO Enron Company Culture Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission From management down employees have little doubt that theyre creating revolutionary new businesses This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at Enrons headquarters where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a tickertape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enrons stock price Management Ken Lay assumed the top job at Enron in February not long after the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas where he had been chairman and CEO The two pipeline companies had joined forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being deregulated In the past government authorities set the price that utiliti es could charge for gas and customers were bound by rigid longterm contract s But with deregulation the market determines energy prices and both suppliers and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods The new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating a trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers Enron repeated the process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market in the s Lay has long been hailed as Enrons visionary but COO Skilling is no slouc h Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people Ive ever known sa ys Lay who began working with him in the mids when Skilling was a McKinsey consultant helping Enron develop its gastrading system Ive made it clea r for some time that hes my successor The yearold Skilling who officiall y joined Enron in likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when describing the companys business Lays language is slightly less colorfu l but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enrons future Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the bottom Weve flattened the organization made it more entrepreneurial an d developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas Lay says Take Michae l Moulton who is working in Enrons pulpandpaper trading unit Moulton came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips and when the new uni t begins its operations later this year he will run it Wholesale Energy Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations Enron is still at its core an energy company During the first nine months of this year nearly billion of its billion in revenue came from its wholesale energy operation which centers around making markets in and creating riskmanagement products for natural gas and electricity Some of what Enron sells comes fr om its own gas production and electricpower generation but the bulk of it is bought from other energy producers with excess capacity The companys trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from EnronOnline which now handles about percent of its transaction volume Margins are razorthin maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt of electricity standard contract measures But Enron isnt doing trades just to make money it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable it to package together riskmanagement products such as futures and swap contracts that companies can use to hedge their energy costs Enron is a principal in every trade taking full responsibility for actual delivery of the product be it gas electricity or even pulp and paper Overall margins in the wholesale energy business average one to three percent Trading is a risky business of course but few companies manage risk bette r than Enron which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri ce moves Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best modeling systems hires the brightest people and has trading experience throughout the country says Gregory Phelps a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund s who closely follows the utilities sector Enron employs a dozen meteorologists on its gastrading floor to monitor any weather changes from an oncomi ng cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico th at could affect supply and demand Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe which is in the early stages of deregulation Enron established a presence in the UK Germany and Scandinavia in the early to mids It currently has offices in countries making markets and hedging risks in a region where stateowned utilities still loom large and national differences present formidable hurdles Were the only company wi th panEuropean operations says Mark Frevert who heads the wholesale energy unit Theres a lot of complexity but we like markets where its difficult Broadband Operations The roots of Enrons bandwidth trading go back to when the company bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ y market At the time the utility was laying fiberoptic cable alongside it s gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City and as it was being deployed the Enron mindset of Can we trade this stuff kicked in says Kenneth Rice CEO of Enron Broadband Services Bandwidth lends itself well to bein g traded like a commodity Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from carriers such as ATT NYSE T Global Crossing NYSE GX and Qwest NYSE Q As it does with energy Enron bundles together bandwidth then sells and delivers it on an asneeded basis to content providers network carriers and other endusers Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and for a specified period over a fiberoptic network that stretches nearly miles and connects some major cities in the United States Europeand Japan Enron is certainly ambitious It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold which up until now has been in fixedrate monthly contracts that lock buyer s into paying for capacity they dont always need Enron provides bandwidth on demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period s of time for instance if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o f its CEO to its offices around the globe The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a monthly contract for DS bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o n a Global Crossing network DS is an industry standard for moving data at a speed of megabits per second fast enough for streaming video Enron delivered months worth of DS broadband capacity in the third quarter alone and is on target to meet its yearend goal of DS months Both Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute billion in annual operating profits in five years or nearly as much as wholesale ener gy contributed in Meanwhile the company expects to pour another million into broadband services during each of the next two years offset by the pending billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The other major piece of Enrons broadband strategy centers on delivering streaming video Using Sun Microsystems Nasdaq SUNW servers and switches made by Lucent Technologies NYSE LU and Cisco Systems Nasdaq CSCO along with its own internally developed software Enrons broadband system is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams Content customers ran ge from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster NYS E BBI which this summer inked a year deal to distribute videoondemand over Enrons network Video will be the king application Skilling says That s where its all going to happen Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enrons decision to plunk down million for the year naming rights to Enron Field the Houston Astros new retractabledome baseball stadium But the deal also helped Enron seal a year million agreement to outsource the energy management of the stadium So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made million in the process Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market considering that US businesses spend more than billion on heat and electricity to run thei r operations every year Enter Enron Energy Services which does everything from analyzing a companys energy supply chain to pinpointing its energyguzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying moreefficient gear The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group NYSE SPG before making recommendations that landed it a year billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simons realestate properties The complexity of this business is so enormous that if youre going to be the leader youve got to know every detail says Marty Sunde head of the groups North American unit Energy savings can be significant Enron guarantees eight to percent bu t sometimes the savings can be even greater The business which began in recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT of million this year Enron is on target to land billion in customer contracts in double last years total Theres no reason this business cant roughly double in each of the next f ew years Lay says Enron is very very confident Their tone borders on excessive confidence but their track record warrants that Erik Gustafson Senior Portfolio Manager Stein Roe Farnham The Competition Some of Enrons trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t he deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications Dynegy NYSE DYN located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a nd called Enron Jr by at least one analyst has its own gas and electricitytrading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading The same goes for Williams Companies NYSE WMB whose fiberoptic network is much larger than Enrons A consortium of six energy companies including Aquila Energy a leading power marketer just launched an online energytrading system to rival EnronOnline Several existing bandwidth traders including ArbinetthexchangeRateXchang e AMEX RTX and BandX essentially provide Webbased bulletin boards for companies to find trading partners They dont actually deliver the product which Enron feels gives it an advantage In the energyservices business Enron competes with a whole host of players including consultants regiona l utilities and energy outsourcers but none have Enrons geographic scope Its a challenge to value Enrons stock because its such a hybrid It always seems expensive but it continues to outperform expectations Zach Wagner Analyst Edward D Jones Co What Its Worth Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along its four reported business lines using a sumoftheparts model They also typically value the companys businesses in terms of EBIT judging tha t to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enrons income because its business es are so capital intensive Using those metrics and a recent stock price of Enrons pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly valued at wholesale energy at energy services at and broadband services at Skilling believes the multiple of times EBIT assigned to wholesale energy is too low considering that business is expected to grow percent this year to billion some percent of Enrons projected total EBIT And wholesale energys EBIT growth is likely to exceed percent annually for at least t he next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy markets Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and broadband not to mention the potential for new commoditytrading markets and Skilli ng argues Enrons stock is easily worth Analysts are more cautious Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay but bandwidth i s still a couple of years away from profitability In the meantime Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market potential of bandwidth trading and that the quick acceptance of this product in the market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the mids Niles thinks Enrons overall energy operations alone are worth more than Enrons current share price If thats true tacking on the EBIT value for bandwidth would make Enron a stock Ultimately many investors will look at plain old earnings per share If Enron meets analysts consensus earnings forecast of a share next yea r and maintains its current multiple of times earnings it would be worth Social Responsibility Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce methane emissions and has been applauded for its windpower division But certain Enron projects such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant in India have been mired in controversy The state police there squelched protests against the plant in and with beatings and jailings and Human Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th e suppression of dissent and didnt speak out against human rights violations Enron has since built a bed hospital in the area and committed to improve the communitys water and sanitation infrastructures The Upside With less than half of the residential power market in the US open to competition electricity deregulation is far from over Some analysts belie ve the entire market will be deregulated within five years This would enable Enron to expand its leading energytrading business On the retail side Enron could get a boost from the New Power Company a partnership it formed with AOL NYSE AOL and IBM NYSE IBM aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via the Internet Enrons attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi a ended in failure in and the company readily admits this isnt one of its strengths So its relying on IBMs backoffice expertise to handle the paperwork and AOLs Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power The Downside The muchballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations Currently only five
