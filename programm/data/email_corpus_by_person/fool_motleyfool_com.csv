This weekly email offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q What do you think of viaticals as investments A Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent years But theyre not without risk and they may make some people uncomfortable Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his or her life insurance policy to someone else Imagine John stricken with a fatal form of cancer Hes and is expected to live only three more years If he needs cash to pay for medical bills or just to spend and enjoy he might sell his life insurance policy to Jane If its set to pay on his death Jane might pay for it That way he gets a lot of cash now and Jane expects to get the in about three years At that rate shed be earning roughly a percent annual return There are many risks though John may hang on for seven years significantly reducing Janes return Indeed a cure for his cancer might be discovered John may even outlive Jane Its true that these settlements can provide a service for sick people but theyre not necessarily winwin The middlemen arranging these settlements take cuts Also if John lives hes without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to insure him as hes been so sick recently Were uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs Also there have been many instances of fraud with viaticals Q What does shrinkage mean in the business world A It refers to the loss of inventory

Question discussion board maspiD maspiD INVESTING BASICS IN THE MARGINS If youre new to investing youve probably stared at an income statement sometimes called a statement of operations and scratched your head wondering what its telling you Let us help First understand that the income statement summarizes sales and profits over a period of time It might cover three months or a year for example It will usually offer information for the yearago period as well so you can compare the two and spot trends Heres a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example Lets look at Eskimo Pie Corps income statement for fiscal year At the top as with every income statement youll find net sales sometimes called revenues For Eskimo Pie theyre million From now on as we work down the income statement various costs will be subtracted from the revenues leaving different levels of profit The item youll find just under revenues is cost of goods sold abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of sales which represents the cost of producing the products or services sold For Eskimo Pie its million Subtract the COGS from revenues and youll get a gross profit of million To find the gross profit margin simply divide the gross profit by revenues million divided by million yields a gross margin of percent Compare results with industry peers For example at a similar time gross margin was percent for Ben Jerrys which has a somewhat different business model Next the remaining costs involved in operating the business such as support staff salaries utility bills and advertising expenses are subtracted leaving the operating profit Eskimo Pies operating profit is million Divide this by revenues and you get a slim operating margin of percent This reveals the profitability of the companys principal business Ben Jerrys percent Finally after items such as taxes and interest payments are accounted for we come to net income near the bottom of the statement Eskimo Pies is million Divide that by revenues and you get a net profit margin of percent Ben Jerrys percent The last part of the income statement is where the company divides its net income by shares outstanding to arrive at earnings per share EPS Thats it IN THE SPOTLIGHT Learn more about margins and other ways to evaluate companies in our How to Value Stocks area maspiD Every weekday we feature a Fribble usually penned

Daily Escape newsletter maspiD ASK THE FOOL This weekly email offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy What causes mortgage rates to rise and fall A They fluctuate along with other interest rates Interest rates are affected chiefly by inflation and the market for debt notes bills and bonds among other instruments With inflation extremely low in recent years weve enjoyed low interest rates But if signs of inflation begin to pop up its expected that the Federal Reserve led by Alan Greenspan will hike up shortterm interest rates via an adjustment in the rate of interest on federal funds The fed funds rate is the rate of interest a bank can charge another bank for use of its excess money The Fed can also change the discount rate or the rate paid by a bank to borrow shortterm funds from the Fed The prime rate and other rates such as mortgage rates are based primarily on these two interest rates The Fed raises these interest rates when the economy appears to be growing too briskly which can spur inflation When the economy is sluggish it might cut these rates in order to give American enterprise a boost Lower rates give companies and people including houseshoppers an incentive to borrow money However remember that the money markets themselves basic supply and demand for money at each price point exert the biggest influence over interest rates though the Fed is a big influence on market expectations Q Where online can I access earnings reports that companies file with the SEC

Click for Awaycoms Daily Escape newsletter maspi Everythings got a moral if only you can find it Lewis Carroll COKE LOSES ITS FIZZ FOR QUAKER Cokes board says no thanks to the Quaker Oats deal Whos next in line By LouAnn Lofton First it was PepsiCo NYSE PEP Then it was CocaCola NYSE KO Now it looks like its the French food company Groupe Danone NYSE DA What am I talking about The latest bidder for cereal company and Gatoradeowner Quaker Oats NYSE OAT of course Talks between Coke and Quaker are over Cokes board of directors met yesterday to discuss the potential billion stock acquisition of Quaker CocaCola wanted Quaker for the same reason that Pepsi did the Gatorade sports drink Gatorade controls about of the sports drink market with Cokes Powerade coming in second Coke would have been saddled though with those parts of Quakers business that make up the majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest its cereal and oatmeal operations Its likely that several factors led to the decision by Cokes board not to proceed with the Quaker acquisition First with value guru Warren Buffett as a director you better believe that the price Coke was going to pay for Quaker was a very important consideration Cokes shares had been driven down since the potential deal was announced Monday as many thought Coke would be paying too much for Quaker Another factor that likely caused the board to reject the acquisition was the potential for antitrust hangups with the deal given that Cokes sports drink Powerade controls the largest part of the market after Gatorade A third contributing factor was probably one of focus Coke refocused itself on its core beverages business in the late s and buying Quaker with its Capn Crunch and RiceARoni among other brands would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again The company doesnt appear to want to take that route So Pepsis out Cokes out and already another company has announced that its pulling a chair up to the bidding table Danone issued a statement confirming that it is considering a bid for Quaker The bottled water dairy products and biscuits company wants to develop its business to become a world leader in focused growth oriented healthy nutrition and beverage business Perhaps Quaker can help it get there NEWS TO GO NTT DoCoMo a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation NYSE NTT is rumored to be

shopping bag ladies its hard to believe but once they were children Dean Friedman DOUBLECLICKS DOUBLE TAKE Online advertising powerhouse DoubleClick warns Figures By Rick Aristotle Munarriz It was simply a matter of when DoubleClick Nasdaq DCLK along with fellow online marketers Engage Nasdaq ENGA and Media Nasdaq TFSM had already announced layoffs over the past few weeks Clearly the oncehot Internet advertising niche had run icecold Pink slips and economic booms rarely go handinhand maspi So when DoubleClick set up a conference call yesterday after the markets close it didnt take much of a guess to know what the company had to say It wasnt even a matter of when anymore DoubleClick lowered projections for both the December and January quarters Surprised Not really Its like pulling up to your house on your birthday to find a dozen cars parked on your front lawn and a chorus of hushes as you approach the door This surprise party might only startle the Rip Van Winkle who had last checked DoubleClicks pulse after its September quarter performance The company had reported its first profit at the time and expected similar bottomline results this quarter Now fourthquarter revenues are expected to come in between million and million well off the million previously projected Earnings will be breakeven at best A wider loss than expected will follow in March However DoubleClick still believes that will be a profitable year Surprised at the longterm stroke of optimism You shouldnt be True nearly half of DoubleClicks revenues come from dotcom companies In many cases todays clients will line the corporate obituaries tomorrow as they struggle with cash burn rates in nonprofitable enterprises that the market is no longer interested in subsidizing However one cant deny the lure of online marketing in the bricksandmortar world Internet usage is still growing by leaps and bounds That is something that cant be said of traditional advertising channels such as print television and billboards The online medium also provides a more effective way to target an ad recipient Probably even more important in leaner economic times where ad budgets need to be justified the success of an Internet marketing campaign can be effectively measured So sure these are dark times right now But for investors willing to turn the key and step inside bright lights welcoming smiles

maspiD ASK THE FOOL Q Im embarrassed to ask such a basic question but here goes What does it mean when I hear ATT is up today Is that dollars per share or what A Dont be embarrassed Most of us were never taught these things in school Asking about them is the only way to learn Prices of stocks are always in dollars per share Theyre not always in whole numbers though The world of stock prices is full of fractions all the way down to ths and occasionally even smaller ones So if the film editing firm Splice Girls Inc ticker SPLIC is listed at that means it last traded at per share Similarly means or per share Another way to think of it is to consider how much total market value the company has gained or lost with each price move Find how many shares outstanding the company has Do this via online stock research tools your newspaper or the firms financial statements Multiply that number by the share price If SPLIC has million shares outstanding and drops by per share the company has lost million in market value Q What are buyside and sellside analysts A Buyside analysts work inhouse for institutions such as mutual funds or pension funds They study possible investments and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or sell Sellside analysts work for brokerages trying to sell their ideas to institutions If an institution likes a brokerages research it might do business placing trades through that brokerage The research of sellside analysts also makes its way to individual investors through brokerages Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to

consider its pricetoearnings ratio or PE Another way is to calculate its inverse which is its earnings yield Consider the example of Fryyndar and Ulf Scandinavian Pharmaceuticals ticker FANDU whose motto is Varsgod och svlj Thats Swedish for Here swallow this pill To calculate its PE ratio you simply divide the current stock price by the annual earnings per share EPS If its current annual EPS is and the stock is trading for per share the PE is divided by or While might seem steep its not meaningful until you compare it with the PE ratios of industry peers and consider its growth prospects A high PE means the market is assuming rapid growth Is that assumption reasonable To calculate Fryyndar and Ulfs earnings yield just reverse the PE ratio dividing the annual EPS by the current stock price divided by equals or percent Compared to riskfree Treasury bond rates of roughly percent this doesnt appear to be a bargain But remember Whereas bond rates are fixed earnings typically grow Imagine that FANDU is expected to increase earnings by percent per year If so in years EPS should grow to Assuming we bought shares when they were at the earnings yield for us has now become percent considerably better divided by is It can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growing earnings yield to pass the current year bond rate which is now about percent FANDU passes it in six years If your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is percent it will take FANDU years to reach that target if earnings actually grow at the estimated pace that is Perhaps you can find another investment that will get you there more quickly With riskier companies you might look for them to pass your target rate sooner rather than later The earnings yield is just one of many investor

trial at hand the two major air carriers do a deal By Tom Jacobs Feeling the heat of the Department of Justices DOJ antitrust trial against them defendants Northwest Airlines Nasdaq NWAC and Continental Airlines NYSE CAL announced today an agreement intended to end the dispute The DOJ sued the airlines in over a deal giving Northwest voting control over Continental preventing Continentals takeover by Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL Under the deal Continental would buy back Northwests common stock The parties will ask the federal judge to delay the trial which started last week while the carriers work out the details A CAREFUL DEAL The deal has two goals to address the DOJs belief that the NorthwestContinental combination would lead to higher prices for consumers and to retain the benefits of the two air powers alliance The pact extends the alliance through and changes the NorthwestContinental relationship According to the deal Northwest will pay million for million Continental Class A shares and hold on to million Class B shares Continental will recapitalize reclassifying each Class A share into shares of Class B common stock Continental will issue Northwest a special series of preferred stock which will give Northwest blocking rights over certain Continental business combinations and change of control between Continental and a third party Continental can redeem its preferred stock under certain conditions such as a change of control at Northwest A DELICATE BALANCE The industry and the government are groping in the postderegulation era to weigh the needs of consumers against cutthroat worldwide airline competition For example the DOJ is separately reviewing United Airlines NYSE UAL billion purchase of US Airways Group NYSE U All the airlines have formed alliances similar to Northwests and Continentals involving the nowcommon practice of codesharing which means putting customers who buy tickets with one airline on the other airlines flights and offering reciprocal frequentflyer programs and airport lounge rights The trial began last week after a weeks delay during which settlement talks continued But the trial pressure ultimately caused a change at Northwest which rejected earlier this year Continentals buyback offer At that time the two agreed to reduce Northwests power over Continentals daily operations but it apparently didnt satisfy the DOJ Pending the judges decision on the sevenday delay Continental and Northwest plan to execute the agreement in one week They expect it will take two months to close the deal which would be subject to settlement of the litigation with the DOJ NEWS TO GO The Wall Street Journal reported that tobacco companies Lorillard Tobacco owned by Loews Corp NYSE LTR and Liggett Group owned by Miamis Vector Group NYSE VGR will announce a billion settlement in federal court tobacco litigation in Brooklyn The move is said to include a year payment schedule with Lorillard paying the bulk

Im interested in REITs Real Estate Investment Trusts but I dont understand what FFO refers to Can you explain A REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks but peek under their hoods and youll see a different kind of company REITs typically own many properties such as offices hotels or apartments With most companies net income is a useful number to evaluate reflecting the profits left over from sales after all expenses have been subtracted With REITs though net income isnt as meaningful According to accounting rules the value of REIT properties is decreased over time with depreciation charged against net income reducing it In reality however these properties are probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating So a REITs net income tends to understate its health This is why with REITs you should look at the funds from operation or FFO instead They ignore the effect of depreciation and other noncash charges to help you see a REITs true performance Q I often see SP futures referred to on CNBC Can you explain what futures are and why theyre important A Futures are typically for commodities like lumber soybeans and orange juice They represent contracts between two parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at a set future date Fail to pay attention and you risk having to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies With SP futures each day the party who bet wrong is obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the SP Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on where the market is going They can be very risky UnFoolish shortterm investors pay a lot of attention to SP futures as they can indicate the markets likely moves before trading begins for the day We dont fret about futures though remembering that for most of this century the SP has advanced about percent per year on average Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to our Help area or post

can be both bad and good First the bad If a company is saddled with a lot of debt its locked into interest payments that it must make If it doesnt have the cash to cover these at any point its in deep doodoo Many individuals can probably relate to this having experienced the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards Now the good Consider that most people would never be able to buy their homes without debt Without car and school loans many of us would probably be driving used cars and taking correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers Debt can be a boon for businesses too Many great companies such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co came to life because of early loans to their founders Established companies can make good use of debt as well borrowing to expand operations and grow business Interest payments also decrease a companys taxable income as theyre deductible Investors willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised and invested is earning more than it costs Perhaps youre worried about the debt load of FingernailonBlackboard Car Alarm Co ticker AIEEE Glance at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the effective interest rate for its debt is just percent If AIEEE is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say percent then things arent so bad When companies need money they typically have two main choices They can issue more stock or debt Issuing stock can dilute the value of existing shares Issuing debt can sometimes be more efficient as its aftertax cost can be much cheaper than equity All things being equal though we prefer to see little debt on a balance sheet Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra stock are in a more powerful position than other firms Still you neednt balk at the first sight of debt Just evaluate it carefully IN THE SPOTLIGHT Fool Phil Weiss explained in greater detail about the good bad

THE FOOL Q Whats a mock portfolio A Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to investing and for those trying out new investing methods You simply go through all the motions of investing stopping short of actually plunking down your hardearned cash Research some companies decide which ones youd buy and then set up a pretend portfolio either on paper or online Many websites offer online portfolio tracking and were one of them Keep track of details such as when you bought the shares and at what price Then track your performance aiming to beat the market maspiD Q Ive heard you sing the praises of the Standard Poors SP index fund on your radio show but Im wondering what other indexes are out there A A bunch of indexes exist with each one representing a particular group of companies Well highlight just a few The most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index which includes flagship American giants such as Exxon WalMart Merck CocaCola and Microsoft The SP also focuses on large companies including of Americas biggest and best The Russell Index includes of the largest US companies based on market capitalization current share price multiplied by number of shares outstanding These constitute about percent of the US market For a measure of smallcap companies look to the Russell Its composed of the smallest companies in the Russell The Wilshire is just about the

bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business revolutions Here are a few maspiD Dont worry be crappy Yes you read that right Its Kawasakis inimitable way of reminding us that it can take almost forever to perfect something and that its often best to release a notquiteperfect product and then work on improving its next generation He illustrates this with the Macintosh computer which was shipped in a lessthanperfect configuration only K of RAM no hard drive no documentation and so on Waiting to perfect the product would have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the confidence of software developers Eat your own dog food This sounds crazy but think about it By using your own companys products or services youll understand what the customer experience is like and youll be able to flag problems quickly Forrest Mars Sr the man who built Mars Inc did taste his own companys dog food literally a practice that continues today at the company Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette which maintains a shaving laboratory where employees per day come in unshaven and test the companys and competitors products Similarly bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to commute by Cannondale bikes so that they can offer feedback on products Eat like a bird poop like an elephant Really were not making this stuff up Birds actually eat a lot sometimes

REPORTS Q Internet BB company Commerce One posted solid Q results after the markets close yesterday and now forecasts profitability by the second quarter of next fiscal year By Mike Trigg Internet marketplace software provider Commerce One Nasdaq CMRC reported impressive thirdquarter results after the markets close yesterday highlighted by new customer additions and the signing of several global megaexchanges The announcement came one day after businesstobusiness BB juggernaut Ariba Nasdaq ARBA declared its own results becoming the first BB company to report a breakeven quarter Commerce Ones fiscal third quarter ended September net loss excluding charges was million or per share compared to million or per share in the same period one year ago The Street consensus called for a loss of per share The positive results prompted management to revise its initial projection now calling for profitability by next years fiscal second quarter ends June However revenue figures tell the real story because BB companies are still in a stage of hypergrowth Commerce Ones revenues increased from million in the previous period to million Thats sequential growth The revenue mix was licenses last quarter with services accounting for the remaining last quarter Nevertheless as I mentioned earlier this week deferred revenues and the amount of network revenues within service revenues were two important factors to track Lets take a look at those quickly maspi Commerce One reported network revenues of million a sequential increase of million This number is important because it represents the amount of revenue sharing that occurred on active marketplaces and will substantially increase as more exchanges go live Moreover it currently represents mostly auction and subscription fees However as exchanges mature it will include a greater amount of valueadded and transactionbased revenue Deferred revenues took a jump from million in the previous period to million Deferred revenues are a good liability because they represent cash that has been realized before at least a portion of the services have been completed Its an important figure because it provides upfront investment capital and signifies management isnt overstating business This quarters increase can in part be attributed to the companys partnership with SAP NYSE SAP however management would not disclose to what amount The alliance with SAP continued to show major traction despite being just days old Through the joint partnership the company announced several megaexchanges that include eHitex

shares quickly rose about percent Stocks get added to these indexes to replace ones deemed no longer worthy of being included or ones that have merged with other companies and therefore disappear The announcements draw the attention of investors sending share prices up And once the companies are added index funds that will have to own these stocks begin snapping up shares Unfortunately the stocks

Stocks dont become more inexpensive when they split True you get more shares But each is worth less Imagine you own shares of Sisyphus Transport Corp ticker UPDWN Theyre trading at each and total When Sisyphus splits for youll own shares worth about each Total value drum roll please Yawn Some people drool over stocks about to split thinking the price will surge Stock prices sometimes do pop a little on news of splits But these are artificial moves sustainable only if the businesses grow to justify them The real reason to smile at a split announcement is because it signals that management is bullish Theyre not likely to split their stock if they expect the price to go down Splits come in many varieties such as for or for Theres even a reverse split when you end up with fewer shares with each worth more Reverse splits are usually employed by companies in trouble to avoid looking like the penny stocks they are If a stock is trading at a redflagraising per share and it does a reverse for split the price will rise to and those who held shares will then own Companies often split their stock so that the price will remain psychologically appealing Sometimes not splitting would mean that few people could afford even a single share If Microsoft hadnt split seven times in the last decade each share would be worth more than With stocks just as with any purchase examine what youre getting for the price Study the company and compare the stock price to other numbers such as earnings A low price might be inviting but a stock can be much more of a bargain than a one If your funds are limited you can just buy fewer shares Its always fun to suddenly own more shares but splits are like getting change for a dollar Theyre not cause for celebration IN THE SPOTLIGHT If youd

offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q Tell me about this firm Ive heard of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers Does it underwrite initial public offerings IPOs A Its one of the top venture capital firms based in Silicon Valley Its partners pool their money and invest in fledgling companies specializing in computerrelated technology and life sciences firms Venture capitalists typically enter the scene well before a company gets to the IPO stage They pony up a lot of money to help the firm grow usually in exchange for a large percentage of the company They offer guidance as well The expectation is that once the company grows to a certain point it will go public and the venture capitalists can cash out making a very tidy profit Kleiner Perkins has funded many companies such as Amazoncom and Netscape in their infancy Q Whats a companys payout ratio A Its the percentage of net income the firm pays out to shareholders as a dividend If Buzzys Broccoli Beer ticker BROCB pays per year in dividends and earns per share its payout ratio is percent This shows what the company is doing with its money If much of its earnings are being returned to shareholders then little is being reinvested in operations That can be OK as sometimes reinvested earnings would return less than

maspiD INVESTING BASICS MARKS OF GREAT COMPANIES In this space weve discussed many aspects of evaluating companies honing in on measures such as earnings yield return on assets and so on Its vital though to also evaluate the big picture to make sure that the company youre looking at is a firstclass operation and one youd be proud to own in your portfolio Here are some marks of great companies Powerful brands Think of names well known in the United States or better yet around the world Brands like McDonalds Gucci Campbell Soup and IBM fit the bill If most people dont yet know a companys name then it still has a lot of work to do Significant products or services Look for a company thats selling its customers something they really need or really want Pharmaceutical companies for example manufacture products that people will buy whether theyre flush with funds or strapped Firms like Ben Jerrys and Starbucks offer consumers things they love We often look for products that people buy over and over like cheeseburgers and shampoo instead of items bought only sporadically like cars Consistent reliable earnings and sales growth and robust margins Track how sales and earnings have increased over past years An upwardsloping line suggests that management is planning and executing well encountering few surprises Stack your companys gross operating and net profit margins up against its competitors to see which one is wringing the most value out of each dollar of sales Lots of potential See what the companys growth prospects are Is it expanding abroad Is it coming out with exciting new products or services Are its offerings taking the country by storm Is it trouncing its competition A final consideration when qualifying companies for further research is how well you know the company and industry and how much youd enjoy keeping up with its developments A company might have enormous potential but if reading about it puts you to sleep it might not be

to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q What does it mean when a company is said to be stuffing the channel A company I was interested in has been accused of this A When a company stuffs the channel it ships inventory ahead of schedule filling its distribution channels with more product than is needed Since companies often record sales as soon as they ship products channel stuffing can make it appear that business is booming In reality the products not sold may well be returned to the manufacturer This means sales already claimed may never occur In a sense sales from past quarters are made at the expense of sales in future quarters See if accounts receivable growth is outpacing sales growth If so thats a red flag Alternatively calculate days sales outstanding DSO First divide the last four quarters revenues by Then divide accounts receivable by that number This reveals how many days worth of sales the current accounts receivable represents Between and days is typical You can also follow the same process for the last quarter dividing last quarters revenues by days in a quarter on average A company with a low DSO is getting its cash back quicker and ideally putting it immediately to use getting an edge on the competition Rising numbers can signify channel stuffing Remember this isnt useful for all companies Restaurants and cashbased businesses for example arent going to have much if any receivables Q Whats a holding company A Holding companies own the securities of other firms They usually maintain voting control of these companies as well A good example is Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway which owns GEICO Sees candy and Dexter shoes Got some questions of your own for the

an investor be concerned if one or more officers of a company sell shares of its stock that they own A Although it may look like a red flag it isnt necessarily one Many executives today receive a large part of their compensation in stock options So when they have to buy a house or make a college tuition payment they sell some shares They may also be trying to diversify their investments not wanting to have too much of their portfolio in one company On the other hand one insider or many insiders selling might indeed signal a loss of faith in the company If youre worried you might want to take a closer look at the companys recent performance Perhaps fire up your computer and see what people interested in the company are saying about it online on message boards Q What does insured by FDIC mean and what does it NOT insure A The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp FDIC insures our traditional checking savings and money market accounts as well as CDs held at banks and thrifts for up to Note though that the FDIC does not cover stocks bonds mutual funds life insurance policies annuities and the like For these check with your financial service company to see what kind of insurance may

OPTIONS Imagine you want to invest in Legume Gas Works ticker BEANZ You can buy shares the usual way or you can buy options Heres an introduction to options There are two main types calls and puts A call gives you the right to buy a set amount of shares at a set price within a certain period of time often just a few months For this right you pay a price premium Puts are similar but give you the right to sell shares If Legume is selling for per share and you expect it to rise you could buy October call options for it Lets say you snap up calls to buy shares for each or a total of If just before your options expire Legume is selling for per share you can exercise your options and buy shares for Then you can keep them or sell them for If you sell you make a profit right Nope You paid remember So your profit is down to less when you account for trading commissions Options are risky If Legume stays at or falls your would be entirely lost It has to top per share plus by October for you to profit Some folks like options because of the leverage they offer They point out that if you only have you can only buy shares of a stock Alternatively that could buy many more options tied to hundreds of shares of stock True enough With options though timing is critical If things dont go your way in a shortterm time frame your option will expire worthless Most options expire unexercised and worthless Those most likely to profit from options are the ones who write or sell the options Thats because options are really about buying time not stocks If youre sure that Legumes stock will rise youre probably best off buying its stock Then if it doesnt behave as you expected it to you can either sell the shares or hang on patiently Options are not for beginning investors and even more

shares quickly rose about percent Stocks get added to these indexes to replace ones deemed no longer worthy of being included or ones that have merged with other companies and therefore disappear The

Stocks dont become more inexpensive when they split True you get more shares But each is worth less Imagine you own shares of Sisyphus Transport Corp ticker UPDWN Theyre trading at each and total When Sisyphus splits for youll own shares worth about each Total value drum roll please Yawn Some people drool over stocks about to split thinking the price will surge Stock prices sometimes do pop a little on news of splits But these are artificial moves sustainable only if the businesses grow to justify them The real reason to smile at a split announcement is because it signals that management is bullish Theyre not likely to split their stock if they expect the price to go down Splits come in many varieties such as for or for Theres even a reverse split when you end up with fewer shares with each worth more Reverse splits are usually employed by companies in trouble to avoid looking like the penny stocks they are If a stock is trading at a redflagraising per share and it does a reverse for split the price will rise to and those who held shares will then own Companies often split their stock so that the price will remain psychologically appealing Sometimes not splitting would mean that few people could afford even a single share If Microsoft hadnt split seven times in the last decade each share would be worth more than With stocks just as with any purchase examine what youre getting for the price Study the company and compare the stock price to other numbers such as earnings A low price might be inviting but a stock can be much more of a bargain than a one If your funds are limited you can just buy fewer shares Its always fun to suddenly own more shares but splits are like getting change for a dollar Theyre not cause for celebration IN THE SPOTLIGHT If youd

REPORTS Q Internet BB company Commerce One posted solid Q results after the markets close yesterday and now forecasts profitability by the second quarter of next fiscal year By Mike Trigg Internet marketplace software provider Commerce One Nasdaq CMRC reported impressive thirdquarter results after the markets close yesterday highlighted by new customer additions and the signing of several global megaexchanges The announcement came one day after businesstobusiness BB juggernaut Ariba Nasdaq ARBA declared its own results becoming the first BB company to report a breakeven quarter Commerce Ones fiscal third quarter ended September net loss excluding charges was million or per share compared to million or per share in the same period one year ago The Street consensus called for a loss of per share The positive results prompted management to revise its initial projection now calling for profitability by next years fiscal second quarter ends June However revenue figures tell the real story because BB companies are still in a stage of hypergrowth Commerce Ones revenues increased from million in the previous period to million Thats sequential growth The revenue mix was licenses last quarter with services accounting for the remaining last quarter Nevertheless as I mentioned earlier this week deferred revenues and the amount of network revenues within service revenues were two important factors to track Lets take a look at those quickly maspi Commerce One reported network revenues of million a sequential increase of million This number is important because it represents the amount of revenue sharing that occurred on active marketplaces and will substantially increase as more exchanges go live Moreover it currently represents mostly auction and subscription fees However as exchanges mature it will include a greater amount of valueadded and transactionbased revenue Deferred revenues took a jump from million in the previous period to million Deferred revenues are a good liability because they represent cash that has been realized before at least a portion of the services have been completed Its an important figure because it provides upfront investment capital and signifies management isnt overstating business This quarters increase can in part be attributed to the companys partnership with SAP NYSE SAP however management would not disclose to what amount The alliance with SAP continued to show major traction despite being just days old Through the joint partnership the company announced several megaexchanges that include eHitex high tech Enporion utility Quadrem mining and metals and ForestExpress paper and forest products This gives the company market share for top vertical exchanges To hear Ariba CEO Keith Krach comment on

ASK THE FOOL Q Whats a mock portfolio A Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to investing and for those trying out new investing methods You simply go through all the motions of investing stopping short of actually plunking down your hardearned cash Research some companies decide which ones youd buy and then set up a pretend portfolio either on paper or online Many websites offer online portfolio tracking and were one of them Keep track of details such as when you bought the shares and at what price Then track your performance aiming to beat the market maspiD Q Ive heard you sing the praises of the Standard Poors SP index fund on your radio show but Im wondering what other indexes are out there A A bunch of indexes exist with each one representing a particular group of

on large companies including of Americas biggest and best The Russell Index includes of the largest US companies based on market capitalization current share price multiplied by number of shares

bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business revolutions Here are a few maspiD Dont worry be crappy Yes you read that right Its Kawasakis inimitable way of reminding us that it can take almost forever to perfect something and that its often best to release a notquiteperfect product and then work on improving its next generation He illustrates this with the Macintosh computer which was shipped in a lessthanperfect configuration only K of RAM no hard drive no documentation and so on Waiting to perfect the product would have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the confidence of software developers Eat your own dog food This sounds crazy but think about it By using your own companys products or services youll understand what the customer experience is like and youll be able to flag problems quickly Forrest Mars Sr the man who built Mars Inc did taste his own companys dog food literally a practice that continues today at the company Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette which maintains a shaving laboratory where employees per day come in unshaven and test the companys and competitors products Similarly bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to commute by Cannondale bikes so that they can offer feedback on products Eat like a bird poop like an elephant Really were not making this stuff up Birds actually eat a lot sometimes

Im interested in REITs Real Estate Investment Trusts but I dont understand what FFO refers to Can you explain A REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks but peek under their hoods and youll see a different kind of company REITs typically own many properties such as offices hotels or apartments With most companies net income is a useful number to evaluate reflecting the profits left over from sales after all expenses have been subtracted With REITs though net income isnt as meaningful According to accounting rules the value of REIT properties is decreased over time with depreciation charged against net income reducing it In reality however these properties are probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating So a REITs net income tends to understate its health This is why with REITs you should look at the funds from operation or FFO instead They ignore the effect of depreciation and other noncash charges to help you see a REITs true performance Q I often see SP futures referred to on CNBC Can you explain what futures are and why theyre important A Futures are typically for commodities like lumber soybeans and orange juice They represent contracts between two parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at a set future date Fail to pay attention and you risk having to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies With SP futures each day the party who bet wrong is obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the SP Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on where the market is going They can be very risky UnFoolish shortterm investors pay a lot of attention to SP futures as they can indicate the markets likely moves before trading begins for the day We dont fret about futures though remembering that for most of this century the SP has advanced about percent per year on average Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to our Help area or post

can be both bad and good First the bad If a company is saddled with a lot of debt its locked into interest payments that it must make If it doesnt have the cash to cover these at any point its in deep doodoo Many individuals can probably relate to this having experienced the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards Now the good Consider that most people would never be able to buy their homes without debt Without car and school loans many of us would probably be driving used cars and taking correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers Debt can be a boon for businesses too Many great companies such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co came to life because of early loans to their founders Established companies can make good use of debt as well borrowing to expand operations and grow business Interest payments also decrease a companys taxable income as theyre deductible Investors willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised and invested is earning more than it costs Perhaps youre worried about the debt load of FingernailonBlackboard Car Alarm Co ticker AIEEE Glance at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the effective interest rate for its debt is just percent If AIEEE is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say percent then things arent so bad When companies need money they typically have two main choices They can issue more stock or debt Issuing stock can dilute the value of existing shares Issuing debt can sometimes be more efficient as its aftertax cost can be much cheaper than equity All things being equal though we prefer to see little debt on a balance sheet Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra stock are in a more powerful position than other firms Still you neednt balk at the first sight of debt Just evaluate it carefully IN THE SPOTLIGHT Fool Phil Weiss explained in greater detail about the good bad

discounts Looking to perform some damage control the company also announced a number of restructuring moves Priceline announced it would fire of its employees forcing it to take a charge for an

regarding the survivability of is business model With of its revenues derived from airline ticket sales it comes as no surprise that even the slightest misstep can cause damage Of course shutting

trial at hand the two major air carriers do a deal By Tom Jacobs Feeling the heat of the Department of Justices DOJ antitrust trial against them defendants Northwest Airlines Nasdaq NWAC and Continental Airlines NYSE CAL announced today an agreement intended to end the dispute The DOJ sued the airlines in over a deal giving Northwest voting control over Continental preventing Continentals takeover by Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL Under the deal Continental would buy back Northwests common stock The parties will ask the federal judge to delay the trial which started last week while the carriers work out the details A CAREFUL DEAL The deal has two goals to address the DOJs belief that the NorthwestContinental combination would lead to higher prices for consumers and to retain the benefits of the two air powers alliance The pact extends the alliance through and changes the NorthwestContinental relationship According to the deal Northwest will pay million for million Continental Class A shares and hold on to million Class B shares Continental will recapitalize reclassifying each Class A share into shares of Class B common stock Continental will issue Northwest a special series of preferred stock which will give Northwest blocking rights over certain Continental business combinations and change of control between Continental and a third party Continental can redeem its preferred stock under certain conditions such as a change of control at Northwest A DELICATE BALANCE The industry and the government are groping in the postderegulation era to weigh the needs of consumers against cutthroat worldwide airline competition For example the DOJ is separately reviewing United Airlines NYSE UAL billion purchase of US Airways Group NYSE U All the airlines have formed alliances similar to Northwests and Continentals involving the nowcommon practice of codesharing which means putting customers who buy tickets with one airline on the other airlines flights and offering reciprocal frequentflyer programs and airport lounge rights The trial began last week after a weeks delay during which settlement talks continued But the trial pressure ultimately caused a change at Northwest which rejected earlier this year Continentals buyback offer At that time the two agreed to reduce Northwests power over Continentals daily operations but it apparently didnt satisfy the DOJ Pending the judges decision on the sevenday delay Continental and Northwest plan to execute the agreement in one week They expect it will take two months to close the deal which would be subject to settlement of the litigation with the DOJ NEWS TO GO The Wall Street Journal reported that tobacco companies Lorillard Tobacco owned by Loews Corp NYSE LTR and Liggett Group owned by Miamis Vector Group NYSE VGR will announce a billion settlement in federal court tobacco litigation in Brooklyn The move is said to include a year payment schedule with Lorillard paying the bulk

maspiD ASK THE FOOL Q Im embarrassed to ask such a basic question but here goes What does it mean when I hear ATT is up today Is that dollars per share or what A Dont be embarrassed Most of us were never taught these things in school Asking about them is the only way to learn Prices of stocks are always in dollars per share Theyre not always in whole numbers though The world of stock prices is full of fractions all the way down to ths and occasionally even smaller ones So if the film editing firm Splice Girls Inc ticker SPLIC is listed at that means it last traded at per share Similarly means or per share Another way to think of it is to consider how much total market value the company has gained or lost with each price move Find how many shares outstanding the company has Do this via online stock research tools your newspaper or the firms financial statements Multiply that number by the share price If SPLIC has million shares outstanding and drops by per share the company has lost million in market value Q What are buyside and sellside analysts A Buyside analysts work inhouse for institutions such as mutual funds or pension funds They study possible investments and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or sell Sellside analysts work for brokerages trying to sell their ideas to institutions If an institution likes a brokerages research it might do business placing trades through that brokerage The research of sellside analysts also makes its way to individual investors through brokerages Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to

consider its pricetoearnings ratio or PE Another way is to calculate its inverse which is its earnings yield Consider the example of Fryyndar and Ulf Scandinavian Pharmaceuticals ticker FANDU whose motto is Varsgod och svlj Thats Swedish for Here swallow this pill To calculate its PE ratio you simply divide the current stock price by the annual earnings per share EPS If its current annual EPS is and the stock is trading for per share the PE is divided by or While might seem steep its not meaningful until you compare it with the PE ratios of industry peers and consider its growth prospects A high PE means the market is assuming rapid growth Is that assumption reasonable To calculate Fryyndar and Ulfs earnings yield just reverse the PE ratio dividing the annual EPS by the current stock price divided by equals or percent Compared to riskfree Treasury bond rates of roughly percent this doesnt appear to be a bargain But remember Whereas bond rates are fixed earnings typically grow Imagine that FANDU is expected to increase earnings by percent per year If so in years EPS should grow to Assuming we bought shares when they were at the earnings yield for us has now become percent considerably better divided by is It can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growing earnings yield to pass the current year bond rate which is now about percent FANDU passes it in six years If your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is percent it will take FANDU years to reach that target if earnings actually grow at the estimated pace that is Perhaps you can find another investment that will get you there more quickly With riskier companies you might look for them to pass your target rate sooner rather than later The earnings yield is just one of many investor tools It can help you think more effectively about your expectations for investments IN THE SPOTLIGHT Learn more about the earnings yield in this classic Fool on the Hill article maspiD Another Fool

next in line By LouAnn Lofton First it was PepsiCo NYSE PEP Then it was CocaCola NYSE KO Now it looks like its the French food company Groupe Danone NYSE DA What am I talking about The latest bidder for cereal company and Gatoradeowner Quaker Oats NYSE OAT of course Talks between Coke and Quaker are over Cokes board of directors met yesterday to discuss the potential billion stock acquisition of Quaker CocaCola wanted Quaker for the same reason that Pepsi did the Gatorade sports drink Gatorade controls about of the sports drink market with Cokes Powerade coming in second Coke would have been saddled though with those parts of Quakers business that make up the majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest its cereal and oatmeal operations Its likely that several factors led to the decision by Cokes board not to proceed with the Quaker acquisition First with value guru Warren Buffett as a director you better believe that the price Coke was going to pay for Quaker was a very important consideration Cokes shares had been driven down since the potential deal was announced Monday as many thought Coke would be paying too much for Quaker Another factor that likely caused the board to reject the acquisition was the potential for antitrust hangups with the deal given that Cokes sports drink Powerade controls the largest part of the market after Gatorade A third contributing factor was probably one of focus Coke refocused itself on its core beverages business in the late s and buying Quaker with its Capn Crunch and RiceARoni among other brands would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again The company doesnt appear to want to take that route So Pepsis out Cokes out and already another company has announced that its pulling a chair up to the bidding table

Daily Escape newsletter maspiD ASK THE FOOL This weekly email offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy What causes mortgage rates to rise and fall A They fluctuate along with other interest rates Interest rates are affected chiefly by inflation and the market for debt notes bills and bonds among other instruments With inflation extremely low in recent years weve enjoyed low interest rates But if signs of inflation begin to pop up its expected that the Federal Reserve led by Alan Greenspan will hike up shortterm interest rates via an adjustment in the rate of interest on federal funds The fed funds rate is the rate of interest a bank can charge another bank for use of its excess money The Fed can also change the discount rate or the rate paid by a bank to borrow shortterm funds from the Fed The prime rate and other rates such as mortgage rates are based primarily on these two interest rates The Fed raises these interest rates when the economy appears to be growing too briskly which can spur inflation When the economy is sluggish it might cut these rates in order to give American enterprise a boost Lower rates give companies and people including houseshoppers an incentive to borrow money However remember that the money markets themselves basic supply and demand for money at each price point exert the biggest influence over interest rates though the Fed is a big influence on market expectations Q Where online can I access earnings reports that companies file with the SEC

This weekly email offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q What do you think of viaticals as investments A Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent years But theyre not without risk and they may make some people uncomfortable Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his or her life insurance policy to someone else Imagine John stricken with a fatal form of cancer Hes and is expected to live only three more years If he needs cash to pay for medical bills or just to spend and enjoy he might sell his life insurance policy to Jane If its set to pay on his death Jane might pay for it That way he gets a lot of cash now and Jane expects to get the in about three years At that rate shed be earning roughly a percent annual return There are many risks though John may hang on for seven years significantly reducing Janes return Indeed a cure for his cancer might be discovered John may even outlive Jane Its true that these settlements can provide a service for sick people but theyre not necessarily winwin The middlemen arranging these settlements take cuts Also if John lives hes without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to insure him as hes been so sick recently Were uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs Also there have been many instances of fraud with viaticals Q What does shrinkage mean in the business world A It refers to the loss of inventory

Question discussion board maspiD maspiD INVESTING BASICS IN THE MARGINS If youre new to investing youve probably stared at an income statement sometimes called a statement of operations and scratched your head wondering what its telling you Let us help First understand that the income statement summarizes sales and profits over a period of time It might cover three months or a year for example It will usually offer information for the yearago period as well so you can compare the two and spot trends Heres a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example Lets look at Eskimo Pie Corps income statement for fiscal year At the top as with every income statement youll find net sales sometimes called revenues For Eskimo Pie theyre million From now on as we work down the income statement various costs will be subtracted from the revenues leaving different levels of profit The item youll find just under revenues is cost of goods sold abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of sales which represents the cost of producing the products or services sold For Eskimo Pie its million Subtract the COGS from revenues and youll get a gross profit of million To find the gross profit margin simply divide the gross profit by revenues million divided by million yields a gross margin of percent Compare results with industry peers For example at a similar time gross margin was percent for Ben Jerrys which has a somewhat different business model Next the remaining costs involved in operating the business such as support staff salaries utility bills and advertising expenses are subtracted leaving the operating profit Eskimo Pies operating profit is million Divide this by revenues and you get a slim operating margin of percent This reveals the profitability of the companys principal business Ben Jerrys percent Finally after items such as taxes and interest payments are accounted for we come to net income near the bottom of the statement Eskimo Pies is million Divide that by revenues and you get a net profit margin of percent Ben Jerrys percent The last part of the income statement is where the company divides its net income by shares outstanding to arrive at earnings per share EPS Thats it IN THE SPOTLIGHT Learn more about margins and other ways to evaluate companies in our How to Value Stocks area maspiD Every weekday we feature a Fribble usually penned

to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q What does it mean when a company is said to be stuffing the channel A company I was interested in has been accused of this A When a company stuffs the channel it ships inventory ahead of schedule filling its distribution channels with more product than is needed Since companies often record sales as soon as they ship products channel stuffing can make it appear that business is booming In reality the products not sold may well be returned to the manufacturer This means sales already claimed may never occur In a sense sales from past quarters are made at the expense of sales in future quarters See if accounts receivable growth is outpacing sales growth If so thats a red flag Alternatively calculate days sales outstanding DSO First divide the last four quarters revenues by Then divide accounts receivable by that number This reveals how many days worth of sales the current accounts receivable represents Between and days is typical You can also follow the same process for the last quarter dividing last quarters revenues by days in a quarter on average A company with a low DSO is getting its cash back quicker and ideally putting it immediately to use getting an edge on the competition Rising numbers can signify channel stuffing Remember this isnt useful for all companies Restaurants and cashbased businesses for example arent going to have much if any receivables Q Whats a holding company A Holding companies own the securities of other firms They usually maintain voting control of these companies as well A good example is Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway which owns GEICO Sees candy and Dexter shoes Got some questions of your own for the

though to also evaluate the big picture to make sure that the company youre looking at is a firstclass operation and one youd be proud to own in your portfolio Here are some marks of great companies Powerful brands Think of names well known in the United States or better yet around the world Brands like McDonalds Gucci Campbell Soup and IBM fit the bill If most people dont yet know a companys name then it still has a lot of work to do Significant products or services Look for a company thats selling its customers something they really need or really want Pharmaceutical companies for example manufacture products that people will buy whether theyre flush with funds or strapped Firms like Ben Jerrys and Starbucks offer consumers things they love We often look for products that people buy over and over like cheeseburgers and shampoo instead of items bought only sporadically like cars Consistent reliable earnings and sales growth and robust margins Track how sales and earnings have increased over past years An upwardsloping line suggests that management is planning and executing well encountering few surprises Stack your companys gross operating and net profit margins up against its competitors to see which one is wringing the most value out of each dollar of sales Lots of potential See what the companys growth prospects are Is it expanding abroad Is it coming out with exciting new products or services Are its offerings taking the country by storm Is it trouncing its competition A final consideration when qualifying companies for further research is how well you know the company and industry and how much youd enjoy keeping up with its developments A company might have enormous potential but if reading about it puts you to sleep it might not be

Should I Invest in HighYield REITS QA How Much Do I Need to Invest LESSON Warren Buffett on Investing SPONSORED BY Kaplan Become a Financial Planner Kaplan Colleges online Cert in Financial Planning program prepares you for success in the ranked profession Invest in your future career today maspi YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED Q WHY DO SOME REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS REITS HAVE TERRIFIC DIVIDEND YIELDS WHILE OTHERS DONT IS THERE ANY REASON NOT TO INVEST IN HIGHYIELD REITS A If a yield looks too good to be true it probably is Remember that its the market that sets the price of the stock And as a stocks price drops its yield rises For perspective consider that a year US Treasury is priced to yield around percent because investors are pretty sure the dividend will be paid But Russian government bond yields can hover around percent because investors are not so sure The same goes with REITs As an example consider Kranzco the highest yielding shopping center REIT with a yield of around percent at the time of this writing in Because of weak earnings it has been forced to cut its dividend This development caused many investors to sell sending the stock price south and the yield up Managements dividend cut may be enough but investors are understandably nervous about what the future holds If you invest in a REIT yielding percent things may well turn out hunkydory But if you go for one kicking out percent to percent youre buying into income streams that other folks find pretty doubtful Youll want to do enough research to be pretty sure youre right Q WHAT IS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN INVEST WHAT IF YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY SHARES A Its tragic that many people put off investing for years thinking theyre not rich enough to benefit from the stock market You definitely dont need to have or more before you start investing You dont have to buy shares at a time You can buy shares or nine shares or even fractions of shares using some services For instance at buyandholdcom you can invest as little as at a time and buy fractional shares of stock paying per trade maspi If youre really interested in learning more about the basics check out our Beginning Investing Online Seminar that also includes a copy of our Money Guide maspi THIS WEEKS LESSON WARREN BUFFETT ON INVESTING A great way to learn about investing is to glean insights from experienced successful investors One of the savviest is Warren Buffett Here are some comments he made at his Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in The first investment primer was written by Aesop in BC He said A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush Aesop forgot to include when you get the two in the bush and what interest rates are Investing is simply figuring out your cash outlay the bird in the hand and comparing it to how many birds are in the bush and when you get them Its no religious thing why we dont invest in technology Its just that weve never found a company where we think we know what the bush will look like in years and how many birds will be in it We understand technology and its impact on society Its the predictability of the economics of the situation years out that we dont understand The only way we know how to make money is to buy businesses we understand I own shares of companies such as Microsoft and Intel so I get the annual reports I dont think its a dumb thing if you want to learn about businesses to invest tiny amounts in various companies especially for young people to get exposed to various managements to go to shareholder meetings get reports etc It pays to have the right role modelsheroes Youll want to be a little or a lot more I tell students to pick out the qualities they admire in people they admire and ask why they cant develop those qualities themselves Its very simple The person youd really like to admire is yourself Berkshires Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added You cant avoid making wrong decisions in life but if you recognize them and do something about them you can wring some lemonade out of them Weve scrambled our way out of many mistakes For more Buffett wisdom head to berkshirehathawaycom where there are several

This weekly email offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q What do you think of viaticals as investments A Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent years But theyre not without risk and they may make some people uncomfortable Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his or her life insurance policy to someone else Imagine John stricken with a fatal form of cancer Hes and is expected to live only three more years If he needs cash to pay for medical bills or just to spend and enjoy he might sell his life insurance policy to Jane If its set to pay on his death Jane might pay for it That way he gets a lot of cash now and Jane expects to get the in about three years At that rate shed be earning roughly a percent annual return There are many risks though John may hang on for seven years significantly reducing Janes return Indeed a cure for his cancer might be discovered John may even outlive Jane Its true that these settlements can provide a service for sick people but theyre not necessarily winwin The middlemen arranging these settlements take cuts Also if John lives hes without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to insure him as hes been so sick recently Were uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs Also there have been many instances of fraud with viaticals Q What does shrinkage mean in the business world A It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through usual ways such as accidental breakage theft weather damage etc Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to our Help area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question discussion board maspiD maspiD INVESTING BASICS IN THE MARGINS If youre new to investing youve probably stared at an income statement sometimes called a statement of operations and scratched your head wondering what its telling you Let us help First understand that the income statement summarizes sales and profits over a period of time It might cover three months or a year for example It will usually offer information for the yearago period as well so you can compare the two and spot trends Heres a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example Lets look at Eskimo Pie Corps income statement for fiscal year At the top as with every income statement youll find net sales sometimes called revenues For Eskimo Pie theyre million From now on as we work down the income statement various costs will be subtracted from the revenues leaving different levels of profit The item youll find just under revenues is cost of goods sold abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of sales which represents the cost of producing the products or services sold For Eskimo Pie its million Subtract the COGS from revenues and youll get a gross profit of million To find the gross profit margin simply divide the gross profit by revenues million divided by million yields a gross margin of percent Compare results with industry peers For example at a similar time gross margin was percent for Ben Jerrys which has a somewhat different business model Next the remaining costs involved in operating the business such as support staff salaries utility bills and advertising expenses are subtracted leaving the operating profit Eskimo Pies operating profit is million Divide this by revenues and you get a slim operating margin of percent This reveals the profitability of the companys principal business Ben Jerrys percent Finally after items such as taxes and interest payments are accounted for we come to net income near the bottom of the statement Eskimo Pies is million Divide that by revenues and you get a net profit margin of percent Ben Jerrys percent The last part of the income statement is where the company divides its net income by shares outstanding to arrive at earnings per share EPS Thats it IN THE SPOTLIGHT Learn more about margins and other ways to evaluate companies in our How to Value Stocks area maspiD Every weekday we feature a Fribble usually penned

Daily Escape newsletter maspiD ASK THE FOOL This weekly email offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy What causes mortgage rates to rise and fall A They fluctuate along with other interest rates Interest rates are affected chiefly by inflation and the market for debt notes bills and bonds among other instruments With inflation extremely low in recent years weve enjoyed low interest rates But if signs of inflation begin to pop up its expected that the Federal Reserve led by Alan Greenspan will hike up shortterm interest rates via an adjustment in the rate of interest on federal funds The fed funds rate is the rate of interest a bank can charge another bank for use of its excess money The Fed can also change the discount rate or the rate paid by a bank to borrow shortterm funds from the Fed The prime rate and other rates such as mortgage rates are based primarily on these two interest rates The Fed raises these interest rates when the economy appears to be growing too briskly which can spur inflation When the economy is sluggish it might cut these rates in order to give American enterprise a boost Lower rates give companies and people including houseshoppers an incentive to borrow money However remember that the money markets themselves basic supply and demand for money at each price point exert the biggest influence over interest rates though the Fed is a big influence on market expectations Q Where online can I access earnings reports that companies file with the SEC

next in line By LouAnn Lofton First it was PepsiCo NYSE PEP Then it was CocaCola NYSE KO Now it looks like its the French food company Groupe Danone NYSE DA What am I talking about The latest bidder for cereal company and Gatoradeowner Quaker Oats NYSE OAT of course Talks between Coke and Quaker are over Cokes board of directors met yesterday to discuss the potential billion stock acquisition of Quaker CocaCola wanted Quaker for the same reason that Pepsi did the Gatorade sports drink Gatorade controls about of the sports drink market with Cokes Powerade coming in second Coke would have been saddled though with those parts of Quakers business that make up the majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest its cereal and oatmeal operations Its likely that several factors led to the decision by Cokes board not to proceed with the Quaker acquisition First with value guru Warren Buffett as a director you better believe that the price Coke was going to pay for Quaker was a very important consideration Cokes shares had been driven down since the potential deal was announced Monday as many thought Coke would be paying too much for Quaker Another factor that likely caused the board to reject the acquisition was the potential for antitrust hangups with the deal given that Cokes sports drink Powerade controls the largest part of the market after Gatorade A third contributing factor was probably one of focus Coke refocused itself on its core beverages business in the late s and buying Quaker with its Capn Crunch and RiceARoni among other brands would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again The company doesnt appear to want to take that route So Pepsis out Cokes out and already another company has announced that its pulling a chair up to the bidding table Danone issued a statement confirming that it is considering a bid for Quaker The bottled water dairy products and biscuits company wants to develop its business to become a world leader in focused growth oriented healthy nutrition and beverage business Perhaps Quaker can help it get there NEWS TO GO NTT DoCoMo a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation NYSE NTT is rumored to be

maspiD ASK THE FOOL Q Im embarrassed to ask such a basic question but here goes What does it mean when I hear ATT is up today Is that dollars per share or what A Dont be embarrassed Most of us were never taught these things in school Asking about them is the only way to learn Prices of stocks are always in dollars per share Theyre not always in whole numbers though The world of stock prices is full of fractions all the way down to ths and occasionally even smaller ones So if the film editing firm Splice Girls Inc ticker SPLIC is listed at that means it last traded at per share Similarly means or per share Another way to think of it is to consider how much total market value the company has gained or lost with each price move Find how many shares outstanding the company has Do this via online stock research tools your newspaper or the firms financial statements Multiply that number by the share price If SPLIC has million shares outstanding and drops by per share the company has lost million in market value Q What are buyside and sellside analysts A Buyside analysts work inhouse for institutions such as mutual funds or pension funds They study possible investments and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or sell Sellside analysts work for brokerages trying to sell their ideas to institutions If an institution likes a brokerages research it might do business placing trades through that brokerage The research of sellside analysts also makes its way to individual investors through brokerages Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to

consider its pricetoearnings ratio or PE Another way is to calculate its inverse which is its earnings yield Consider the example of Fryyndar and Ulf Scandinavian Pharmaceuticals ticker FANDU whose motto is Varsgod och svlj Thats Swedish for Here swallow this pill To calculate its PE ratio you simply divide the current stock price by the annual earnings per share EPS If its current annual EPS is and the stock is trading for per share the PE is divided by or While might seem steep its not meaningful until you compare it with the PE ratios of industry peers and consider its growth prospects A high PE means the market is assuming rapid growth Is that assumption reasonable To calculate Fryyndar and Ulfs earnings yield just reverse the PE ratio dividing the annual EPS by the current stock price divided by equals or percent Compared to riskfree Treasury bond rates of roughly percent this doesnt appear to be a bargain But remember Whereas bond rates are fixed earnings typically grow Imagine that FANDU is expected to increase earnings by percent per year If so in years EPS should grow to Assuming we bought shares when they were at the earnings yield for us has now become percent considerably better divided by is It can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growing earnings yield to pass the current year bond rate which is now about percent FANDU passes it in six years If your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is percent it will take FANDU years to reach that target if earnings actually grow at the estimated pace that is Perhaps you can find another investment that will get you there more quickly With riskier companies you might look for them to pass your target rate sooner rather than later The earnings yield is just one of many investor

trial at hand the two major air carriers do a deal By Tom Jacobs Feeling the heat of the Department of Justices DOJ antitrust trial against them defendants Northwest Airlines Nasdaq NWAC and Continental Airlines NYSE CAL announced today an agreement intended to end the dispute The DOJ sued the airlines in over a deal giving Northwest voting control over Continental preventing Continentals takeover by Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL Under the deal Continental would buy back Northwests common stock The parties will ask the federal judge to delay the trial which started last week while the carriers work out the details A CAREFUL DEAL The deal has two goals to address the DOJs belief that the NorthwestContinental combination would lead to higher prices for consumers and to retain the benefits of the two air powers alliance The pact extends the alliance through and changes the NorthwestContinental relationship According to the deal Northwest will pay million for million Continental Class A shares and hold on to million Class B shares Continental will recapitalize reclassifying each Class A share into shares of Class B common stock Continental will issue Northwest a special series of preferred stock which will give Northwest blocking rights over certain Continental business combinations and change of control between Continental and a third party Continental can redeem its preferred stock under certain conditions such as a change of control at Northwest A DELICATE BALANCE The industry and the government are groping in the postderegulation era to weigh the needs of consumers against cutthroat worldwide airline competition For example the DOJ is separately reviewing United Airlines NYSE UAL billion purchase of US Airways Group NYSE U All the airlines have formed alliances similar to Northwests and Continentals involving the nowcommon practice of codesharing which means putting customers who buy tickets with one airline on the other airlines flights and offering reciprocal frequentflyer programs and airport lounge rights The trial began last week after a weeks delay during which settlement talks continued But the trial pressure ultimately caused a change at Northwest which rejected earlier this year Continentals buyback offer At that time the two agreed to reduce Northwests power over Continentals daily operations but it apparently didnt satisfy the DOJ Pending the judges decision on the sevenday delay Continental and Northwest plan to execute the agreement in one week They expect it will take two months to close the deal which would be subject to settlement of the litigation with the DOJ NEWS TO GO The Wall Street Journal reported that tobacco companies Lorillard Tobacco owned by Loews Corp NYSE LTR and Liggett Group owned by Miamis Vector Group NYSE VGR will announce a billion settlement in federal court tobacco litigation in Brooklyn The move is said to include a year payment schedule with Lorillard paying the bulk billion The Journal reports that the parties hope to insulate themselves from liability from the Florida state court billion judgment The two tobacco companies split from their colleagues after the

interest remains high despite last weeks big news that IBM NYSE IBM canceled plans to use a Transmeta chip in a new laptop computer Computer networking product maker Com Nasdaq COMS agreed to settle

Im interested in REITs Real Estate Investment Trusts but I dont understand what FFO refers to Can you explain A REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks but peek under their hoods and youll see a different kind of company REITs typically own many properties such as offices hotels or apartments With most companies net income is a useful number to evaluate reflecting the profits left over from sales after all expenses have been subtracted With REITs though net income isnt as meaningful According to accounting rules the value of REIT properties is decreased over time with depreciation charged against net income reducing it In reality however these properties are probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating So a REITs net income tends to understate its health This is why with REITs you should look at the funds from operation or FFO instead They ignore the effect of depreciation and other noncash charges to help you see a REITs true performance Q I often see SP futures referred to on CNBC Can you explain what futures are and why theyre important A Futures are typically for commodities like lumber soybeans and orange juice They represent contracts between two parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at a set future date Fail to pay attention and you risk having to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies With SP futures each day the party who bet wrong is obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the SP Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on where the market is going They can be very risky UnFoolish shortterm investors pay a lot of attention to SP futures as they can indicate the markets likely moves before trading begins for the day We dont fret about futures though remembering that for most of this century the SP has advanced about percent per year on average Got some questions of your own for the Fool Head to our Help area or post

can be both bad and good First the bad If a company is saddled with a lot of debt its locked into interest payments that it must make If it doesnt have the cash to cover these at any point its in deep doodoo Many individuals can probably relate to this having experienced the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards Now the good Consider that most people would never be able to buy their homes without debt Without car and school loans many of us would probably be driving used cars and taking correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers Debt can be a boon for businesses too Many great companies such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co came to life because of early loans to their founders Established companies can make good use of debt as well borrowing to expand operations and grow business Interest payments also decrease a companys taxable income as theyre deductible Investors willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised and invested is earning more than it costs Perhaps youre worried about the debt load of FingernailonBlackboard Car Alarm Co ticker AIEEE Glance at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the effective interest rate for its debt is just percent If AIEEE is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say percent then things arent so bad When companies need money they typically have two main choices They can issue more stock or debt Issuing stock can dilute the value of existing shares Issuing debt can sometimes be more efficient as its aftertax cost can be much cheaper than equity All things being equal though we prefer to see little debt on a balance sheet Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra stock are in a more powerful position than other firms Still you neednt balk at the first sight of debt Just evaluate it carefully IN THE SPOTLIGHT Fool Phil Weiss explained in greater detail about the good bad

THIS ISSUE QA WHATS A RUN RATE QA ACTUAL STOCK SALE PRICES LESSON WHEN TO PANIC SPONSORED BY Ameritrade Open an Ameritrade account now and get commissionfree trades for month Learn more at ameritradecom maspi YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED Q Whats a run rate A Imagine that youre studying the financial statements of Digital Diapers Inc ticker EPOOP Its growing very rapidly from quarter to quarter Perhaps for some calculation you need to estimate its current annual rate of sales You could add up the last four quarters worth but that would clearly understate sales as each quarters numbers have been rising Enter the run rate Take the most recent quarters sales of million up from million the quarter before and million before that Multiply that by four and youll have the companys current run rate for sales million This is not a forecast or a measure of past sales its a reflection of the current level of annual sales Q When you decide to sell a stock at a price listed in the newspaper on a particular day do you get that particular amount or the price listed when the shares are actually sold A First know that the stock prices listed in newspapers and online simply reflect the price at which the stock last traded The next trade could occur at a higher or lower price depending on supply and demand Youre not out of luck though You have a choice when placing orders with your broker You can sell at the market which means whatever the current price happens to be or you can place a limit order specifying a minimum price that you require Selling at the market means your shares will probably be sold quickly With a limit order though you risk not getting any takers at your price When were not worried about the price jumping we generally prefer trading at the market And speaking of brokers make sure youre not overpaying for trades by visiting our online discount broker center You can compare fees and services plus get our guidance on finding the right broker for you

of Bedmobile Inc ticker VROOM youll have a lot of trouble determining when its the right time to sell Did VROOMs shares just take a nosedive It might be due to some fleeting market misunderstanding in

REPORTS Q Internet BB company Commerce One posted solid Q results after the markets close yesterday and now forecasts profitability by the second quarter of next fiscal year By Mike Trigg Internet marketplace software provider Commerce One Nasdaq CMRC reported impressive thirdquarter results after the markets close yesterday highlighted by new customer additions and the signing of several global megaexchanges The announcement came one day after businesstobusiness BB juggernaut Ariba Nasdaq ARBA declared its own results becoming the first BB company to report a breakeven quarter Commerce Ones fiscal third quarter ended September net loss excluding charges was million or per share compared to million or per share in the same period one year ago The Street consensus called for a loss of per share The positive results prompted management to revise its initial projection now calling for profitability by next years fiscal second quarter ends June However revenue figures tell the real story because BB companies are still in a stage of hypergrowth Commerce Ones revenues increased from million in the previous period to million Thats sequential growth The revenue mix was licenses last quarter with services accounting for the remaining last quarter Nevertheless as I mentioned earlier this week deferred revenues and the amount of network revenues within service revenues were two important factors to track Lets take a look at those quickly maspi Commerce One reported network revenues of million a sequential increase of million This number is important because it represents the amount of revenue sharing that occurred on active marketplaces and will substantially increase as more exchanges go live Moreover it currently represents mostly auction and subscription fees However as exchanges mature it will include a greater amount of valueadded and transactionbased revenue Deferred revenues took a jump from million in the previous period to million Deferred revenues are a good liability because they represent cash that has been realized before at least a portion of the services have been completed Its an important figure because it provides upfront investment capital and signifies management isnt overstating business This quarters increase can in part be attributed to the companys partnership with SAP NYSE SAP however management would not disclose to what amount The alliance with SAP continued to show major traction despite being just days old Through the joint partnership the company announced several megaexchanges that include eHitex high tech Enporion utility Quadrem mining and metals and ForestExpress paper and forest products This gives the company market share for top vertical exchanges To hear Ariba CEO Keith Krach comment on

SP Index Why is this and is there any way to learn which companies will be added in the future A Youve noticed correctly When it was announced recently that America Online would be added to the SP its shares quickly rose about percent Stocks get added to these indexes to replace ones deemed no longer worthy of being included or ones that have merged with other companies and therefore disappear The announcements draw the attention of investors sending share prices up And once the companies are added index funds that will have to own these stocks begin snapping up shares Unfortunately the stocks

Stocks dont become more inexpensive when they split True you get more shares But each is worth less Imagine you own shares of Sisyphus Transport Corp ticker UPDWN Theyre trading at each and total When Sisyphus splits for youll own shares worth about each Total value drum roll please Yawn Some people drool over stocks about to split thinking the price will surge Stock prices sometimes do pop a little on news of splits But these are artificial moves sustainable only if the businesses grow to justify them The real reason to smile at a split announcement is because it signals that management is bullish Theyre not likely to split their stock if they expect the price to go down Splits come in many varieties such as for or for Theres even a reverse split when you end up with fewer shares with each worth more Reverse splits are usually employed by companies in trouble to avoid looking like the penny stocks they are If a stock is trading at a redflagraising per share and it does a reverse for split the price will rise to and those who held shares will then own Companies often split their stock so that the price will remain psychologically appealing Sometimes not splitting would mean that few people could afford even a single share If Microsoft hadnt split seven times in the last decade each share would be worth more than With stocks just as with any purchase examine what youre getting for the price Study the company and compare the stock price to other numbers such as earnings A low price might be inviting but a stock can be much more of a bargain than a one If your funds are limited you can just buy fewer shares Its always fun to suddenly own more shares but splits are like getting change for a dollar Theyre not cause for celebration IN THE SPOTLIGHT If youd

business By Tom Jacobs Britishbased drug producer SmithKline Beecham NYSE SBH announced today that it would swallow New Jerseys oral products maker Block Drug Nasdaq BLOCA for billion SmithKline will pay a share for Block which closed Friday at up SmithKline ended the week at a mere under its week high SmithKline is expanding its consumer business while competitors such as BristolMyers Squibb NYSE BMY are shedding theirs to focus on drugs SmithKline already earns onethird of its revenues from consumer products which include Aquafresh toothpaste and now adds Blocks Sensodyne toothpaste and Polident denture cleaner brands Commentators speculate that SmithKline is keeping a consumer division to better deliver nonprescription versions of its own drugs that have lost patent protection or that the Block buyout better positions SmithKline to spin off its consumer division At the same time the British drug powerhouse is pushing into genomics It has joined a new publicprivate consortium to fund efforts to decode mouse DNA within the next six months The million Mouse Sequencing Consortium includes SmithKline Affymetrix Nasdaq AFFX the Merck Genome Research Institute the US National Institutes of Health and the Britishbased Wellcome Trust Like its sibling the SNP Consortium the Mouse confab hopes to speed genomic data into the public domain Celera Genomics NYSE CRA and other companies are competing to sequence the mouse genome and SNPs single nucleotide polymorphisms to sell in proprietary databases maspi Surrounding these events is the pending merger of SmithKline with larger drug maker Glaxo Wellcome NYSE GLX The two await regulatory approval to create the worlds secondlargest pharmaceutical firm with a billion market cap Perhaps because of their experience the Federal Trade Commission has delayed the merger twice and now wont rule until the end of the year SmithKline hasnt announced a target date to close the Block deal NEWS TO GO Reuters reports that General Motors NYSE GM and Fiat are joining forces for talks to purchase some or all of ailing South Korean car maker Daewoo Daewoo Motor is one of units of Daewoo Group which creditors rescued in

with researchers Arthur Holden chair of the SNP Consortium and Mouse Consortium see lead story above will form the bank with David Wang former head of genomics and bioinformatics at Motorola NYSE MOT and Andrea Califano former computational biology director at IBM NYSE IBM The bank would perform two main functions designed to keep individual information private assuage fears that information could

Insider Stock Sales a Red Flag LESSON Confronting Contradictory Advice YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED Q What exactly are tech stocks computer makers A Great question The term often refers to computer companies and software makers But these days it can be hard to think of companies that dont employ a fair amount of technology Think of pharmaceutical firms for instance Drug chemistry and drug delivery processes involve technology Golf club manufacturers apply technology to their new product development Pretty much any airplanerelated enterprise uses technology from building jets to booking flights Likewise Federal Express and other delivery specialists rely heavily on technology Of course some companies do so more than others Sun Microsystems for example is much more of a technology company than Hershey When we hear that tech stocks were up today we have to wonder what exactly is being said A good way to think about the term might be to use it for companies that draw most of their revenue from directly using or creating technology Q How bad a sign is it if a companys insiders are selling shares A Its not necessarily bad at all Many executives these days are compensated significantly with stock options They may simply be generating cash to buy a house or put a kid through college We wouldnt fret too much unless an awful lot of a companys top brass were selling shares and selling significant percentages of their holdings Even that could be a coincidence but it might warrant a little scrutiny on your part PS GOT AN INVESTING QUESTION FOR US Post it on our Ask a Foolish Question message board maspi LESSON CONFRONTING CONTRADICTORY ADVICE Learning to invest successfully isnt a straightforward endeavor Youll frequently run across seemingly contradictory advice which will leave you scratching your head The solution to this confusion is to understand that investing is both simple and complex At the beginning its simple Your first steps should be to get out of debt read broadly on investing and perhaps invest your initial dollars in an index fund But once you begin looking into picking individual stocks on your own you may run into some contradictions For example Dont waste your time trying to time the market Always remain invested in stocks And Dont be afraid to stay out of the market at least partially for a while Wait for the fat pitches Heres another pair Dont add money to a falling stock position And Dollarcost average investing regularly in a stock no matter whether its up or down There are many such dilemmas that frustrate new investors Buy and hold forever or at least for a very long time Sell when something much better comes along And Let your winners run Rebalance your portfolio when one or more stocks come to dominate it in a big way There are some points on which most Fools will agree penny stocks are bad technical analysis is dubious but many points on which we differ a little Furthermore scratch the surface of a Fool and youll likely find that many of us are a little contradictory even within our own attitudes Thats fine It just means were complex and that investing can also be complex In some situations buying and holding for decades might work well In others it might make sense to sell when something much more promising comes along If youre a good Foolish investor youre always questioning examining thinking and rethinking Youre continually changing your perceptions of investing perhaps after making some regrettable moves and pondering how they came to pass Life is simple Eat drink breathe sleep Life is complicated Prepare a tax return study physics raise children Wherever you go even in investing there are always contradictions But thats okay My Portfolio maspi My Discussion Boards maspi My Fool

program prepares you for success in the ranked profession Invest in your future career today maspi YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED Q My company matches a certain percent of my pay depending on how much I contribute to my k plan The matching money goes only into the company employee stockpurchase program but my own contributions can go into various mutual funds Shouldnt I at least contribute enough to this k to get the maximum amount that the company will match A Youve answered your own question correctly In most cases its definitely smart to take advantage of as much company matching as possible Lets say that for every you sock away in your k your employer chips in cents Thats an immediate percent return It would be extremely difficult to beat that with any investment method The only time it might not be so great is if the matching money isnt going into something youre comfortable with If its going into stock in the company and youre very uncomfortable about the companys future then perhaps youre getting a percent return that will soon become a percent return Thats an extreme example though And even in that case the money that YOU socked away can be in a safer place growing For a second guide to ks check out this article Q If I own shares of a company and the company is bought out or merges with another company what happens to my shares maspi A Several things could happen If the firm is bought out for cash you might receive a check for your shares If its bought with stock or theres a merger involving a stock swap your shares might be replaced with shares of another company The number of shares you get will be prescribed by an announced formula Some deals involve both stock and cash When a deal youre interested in is announced track down its press releases for

but many people scratch their heads when confronted with it So let us explain It simply expresses the relationship of two numbers a stocks price and the amount of its annual dividend As an example look at Ford Motor Co At the time of this writing it was trading around per share and paying out per year in quarterly installments as a dividend Take and divide it by and youll get Multiply that by and youve got a dividend yield of This means that if you pay for a share of Ford youll earn per year on your investment just from dividends alone Companies rarely decrease or eliminate their dividends as that would make investors unhappy But dividends of solid companies do tend to rise over time delivering more value to shareholders Every now and then a company will announce an increase If in years Fords dividend is that would represent a dividend yield on those shares you bought for Youd be earning a return each year just from dividends There would probably be some stock price appreciation on top of that as well Note that for months or years at a time a dividend will hold steady But the yield can fluctuate daily Thats because a stocks price fluctuates As a stock price rises the dividend yield falls and vice versa If Ford shares for example suddenly doubled in price to the yield would be halved to divided by is If Ford stock fell to per share its yield for those buying it at would be You can find some hefty dividend yields among companies whose stock prices have tumbled A year or two ago for example R J Reynolds Tobacco Holdings paid about per share in annual dividends With its stock trading around per share that was a whopping dividend yield Be careful though If youre attracted to an unusually high dividend yield you should probably study the company extra carefully to make sure its not in so much trouble that a dividend cut is around the corner Lastly know that not all companies pay dividends Younger or quickly growing companies in particular such as Microsoft or Amgen prefer to plow extra cash back into operations SPONSORED BY Kaplan College Become a Financial Planner Kaplan Colleges online Cert in Financial Planning program prepares you for success in the ranked

Thursday May IN THIS ISSUE QA WHATS AN ORDER IMBALANCE QA WHY NOT SELL HIGH LESSON COMMON FINANCIAL MISTAKES SPONSORED BY Kaplan College Become a Financial Planner Kaplan Colleges online Cert in Financial Planning program prepares you for success in the ranked profession Invest in your future career today maspi YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED Q Whats an order imbalance A Order imbalances happen on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE when there are too many buy orders and not enough sell orders or vice versa When they occur the exchange might halt trading temporarily to allow more of the other kind of order to come in This permits better matching of buyers and sellers and makes prices less volatile You might see order imbalances happen whenever theres very good or bad news related to a company and suddenly many people want in or out of it The Nasdaq stock market meanwhile operates on more of a supplyanddemand basis with its trading conducted between many market participants It doesnt halt trading for order imbalances Q Dont you think that anyone who doesnt sell a stock near its alltime high is a fool A A Fool with a capital F maybe but not an idiot Its true that many stocks are now down considerably from their alltime highs But few stocks ever go up in a straight line And any stock that continually rises will continually set alltime highs Its not consistently possible to know what a stock will do in the short term so we avoid trying to carefully time purchases or sales If youre ever holding onto stock in a company whose future doesnt look too bright or stock that seems grossly overvalued you might do well to sell But those of us who have longterm faith in a company and expect its price to be significantly higher in the decades ahead well often do well just happily hanging on Many volatile but solid stocks have often been halved only to double and quadruple again PS GOT AN INVESTING QUESTION FOR US Post it on our Ask a Foolish Question

to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q What does it mean when a company is said to be stuffing the channel A company I was interested in has been accused of this A When a company stuffs the channel it ships inventory ahead of schedule filling its distribution channels with more product than is needed Since companies often record sales as soon as they ship products channel stuffing can make it appear that business is booming In reality the products not sold may well be returned to the manufacturer This means sales already claimed may never occur In a sense sales from past quarters are made at the expense of sales in future quarters See if accounts receivable growth is outpacing sales growth If so thats a red flag Alternatively calculate days sales outstanding DSO First divide the last four quarters revenues by Then divide accounts receivable by that number This reveals how many days worth of sales the current accounts receivable represents Between and days is typical You can also follow the same process for the last quarter dividing last quarters revenues by days in a quarter on average A company with a low DSO is getting its cash back quicker and ideally putting it immediately to use getting an edge on the competition Rising numbers can signify channel stuffing Remember this isnt useful for all companies Restaurants and cashbased businesses for example arent going to have much if any receivables Q Whats a holding company A Holding companies own the securities of other firms They usually maintain voting control of these companies as well A good example is Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway which owns GEICO Sees candy and Dexter shoes Got some questions of your own for the

offers answers to questions that perplex most beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an investingrelated lesson as well Enjoy Q Tell me about this firm Ive heard of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers Does it underwrite initial public offerings IPOs A Its one of the top venture capital firms based in Silicon Valley Its partners pool their money and invest in fledgling companies specializing in computerrelated technology and life sciences firms Venture capitalists typically enter the scene well before a company gets to the IPO stage They pony up a lot of money to help the firm grow usually in exchange for a large percentage of the company They offer guidance as well The expectation is that once the company grows to a certain point it will go public and the venture capitalists can cash out making a very tidy profit Kleiner Perkins has funded many companies such as Amazoncom and Netscape in their infancy Q Whats a companys payout ratio A Its the percentage of net income the firm pays out to shareholders as a dividend If Buzzys Broccoli Beer ticker BROCB pays per year in dividends and earns per share its payout ratio is percent This shows what the company is doing with its money If much of its earnings are being returned to shareholders then little is being reinvested in operations That can be OK as sometimes reinvested earnings would return less than

maspiD INVESTING BASICS MARKS OF GREAT COMPANIES In this space weve discussed many aspects of evaluating companies honing in on measures such as earnings yield return on assets and so on Its vital though to also evaluate the big picture to make sure that the company youre looking at is a firstclass operation and one youd be proud to own in your portfolio Here are some marks of great companies Powerful brands Think of names well known in the United States or better yet around the world Brands like McDonalds Gucci Campbell Soup and IBM fit the bill If most people dont yet know a companys name then it still has a lot of work to do Significant products or services Look for a company thats selling its customers something they really need or really want Pharmaceutical companies for example manufacture products that people will buy whether theyre flush with funds or strapped Firms like Ben Jerrys and Starbucks offer consumers things they love We often look for products that people buy over and over like cheeseburgers and shampoo instead of items bought only sporadically like cars Consistent reliable earnings and sales growth and robust margins Track how sales and earnings have increased over past years An upwardsloping line suggests that management is planning and executing well encountering few surprises Stack your companys gross operating and net profit margins up against its competitors to see which one is wringing the most value out of each dollar of sales Lots of potential See what the companys growth prospects are Is it expanding abroad Is it coming out with exciting new products or services Are its offerings taking the country by storm Is it trouncing its competition A final consideration when qualifying companies for further research is how well you know the company and industry and how much youd enjoy keeping up with its developments A company might have enormous potential but if reading about it puts you to sleep it might not be

Should I Invest in HighYield REITS QA How Much Do I Need to Invest LESSON Warren Buffett on Investing SPONSORED BY Kaplan Become a Financial Planner Kaplan Colleges online Cert in Financial Planning program prepares you for success in the ranked profession Invest in your future career today maspi YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED Q WHY DO SOME REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS REITS HAVE TERRIFIC DIVIDEND YIELDS WHILE OTHERS DONT IS THERE ANY REASON NOT TO INVEST IN HIGHYIELD REITS A If a yield looks too good to be true it probably is Remember that its the market that sets the price of the stock And as a stocks price drops its yield rises For perspective consider that a year US Treasury is priced to yield around percent because investors are pretty sure the dividend will be paid But Russian government bond yields can hover around percent because investors are not so sure The same goes with REITs As an example consider Kranzco the highest yielding shopping center REIT with a yield of around percent at the time of this writing in Because of weak earnings it has been forced to cut its dividend This development caused many investors to sell sending the stock price south and the yield up Managements dividend cut may be enough but investors are understandably nervous about what the future holds If you invest in a REIT yielding percent things may well turn out hunkydory But if you go for one kicking out percent to percent youre buying into income streams that other folks find pretty doubtful Youll want to do enough research to be pretty sure youre right Q WHAT IS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN INVEST WHAT IF YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY SHARES A Its tragic that many people put off investing for years thinking theyre not rich enough to benefit from the stock market You definitely dont need to have or more before you start investing You dont have to buy shares at a time You can buy shares or nine shares or even fractions of shares using some services For instance at buyandholdcom you can invest as little as at a time and buy fractional shares of stock paying per trade maspi If youre really interested in learning more about the basics check out our Beginning Investing Online Seminar that also includes a copy of our Money Guide maspi THIS WEEKS LESSON WARREN BUFFETT ON INVESTING A great way to learn about investing is to glean insights from experienced successful investors One of the savviest is Warren Buffett Here are some comments he made at his Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in The first investment primer was written by Aesop in BC He said A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush Aesop forgot to include when you get the two in the bush and what interest rates are Investing is simply figuring out your cash outlay the bird in the hand and comparing it to how many birds are in the bush and when you get them Its no religious thing why we dont invest in technology Its just that weve never found a company where we think we know what the bush will look like in years and how many birds will be in it We understand technology and its impact on society Its the predictability of the economics of the situation years out that we dont understand The only way we know how to make money is to buy businesses we understand I own shares of companies such as Microsoft and Intel so I get the annual reports I dont think its a dumb thing if you want to learn about businesses to invest tiny amounts in various companies especially for young people to get exposed to various managements to go to shareholder meetings get reports etc It pays to have the right role modelsheroes Youll want to be a little or a lot more I tell students to pick out the qualities they admire in people they admire and ask why they cant develop those qualities themselves Its very simple The person youd really like to admire is yourself Berkshires Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added You cant avoid making wrong decisions in life but if you recognize them and do something about them you can wring some lemonade out of them Weve scrambled our way out of many mistakes For more Buffett wisdom head to berkshirehathawaycom where there are several
