today signed Executive Order D which authorizes the California Department of Water Resources DWR to implement voluntary emergency load curtailment programs for commercial industrial or other large businesses In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power emergencies the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating customers Nearly percent of energy usage in California is commercial Governor Davis said Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even avoid blackouts Therefore I am ordering the Department of Water Resources to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods The Governors order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent System Operator the Public Utilities Commission and the InvestorOwned Utilities The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer and Summer and the DWR will finance the customer incentives The incentives will be determined by a number of factors including the size of the customer and the amount of energy to be curtailed

the last few weeks Loads participating in the ISOs Demand Relief Program raised the question of financial backing of payments for participation in the program As you know under the current version of the ISOs Demand Relief Agreement DRA costs of the DRP are charged to metered Demand including exports and payments are made to participants from market funds received from Scheduling Coordinators SCs on a paywhenpaid basis pursuant to DRA Section In response to the concerns over backing by a creditworthy party the ISO approached the California Department of Water Resources CDWRCERS to provide this financial backing CDWRCERS has concluded that it will not provide backing for the program as it is now designed Discussions continue with CDWRCERS and it appears that backing may be provided albeit for a modified program design The ISO will publish details of such modified program when they become available With respect to Loads under Demand Relief Agreements that have been signed by both the Load aggregator and the ISO the Load aggregator can choose to remain under the existing agreements terms which do not include credit support In that case the ISO will deem the DRA to be in full force and effect and subject to the uncertainty of payment timeframe under the paywhenpaid provisions Alternatively the ISO will allow Load aggregators to terminate their Demand Relief Agreements if they provide written notice to the ISO by June If the ISO does not receive notice of termination from the Load aggregator by June the ISO will dispatch the Loads in accordance with the terms of the existing DRA With respect to Loads for which DRAs have not been signed by both the ISO and the aggregator the ISO is willing to go forward with the signing of DRAs with such parties under the existing terms which again do not include credit support Aggregators wishing to go forward on such terms should contact the ISO as soon as possible When details of a modified program design by CDWRCERS become
