<25691226.1075840333329.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dessauer@investorplace.com,2002-01-13 06:07:38,Why the pessimists are wrong againPST Dear Investor So far so good My earlyOctober projection of Dow by Thanksgiving came true a few days early Now I expect the market to zigzag its way somewhat higher over the course of the next two years But please dont go out and buy the market Index funds and the like may make you richerbut they wont make you truly RICH Thats because the gap between winners and losers will be quite large in some cases HUGE in the reawakening ahead YOU SEE in some ways the economic and market pessimists are RIGHT Things are different this time around And its unwise to expect a rising tide that lifts all boats But the right stocks will pay you handsomely if you buy them now The pessimists may rail about Japans debt load the mess in Argentina and Enrons collapse But frankly my friend the sky is not all gray Were actually beginning to see some upward earnings revisions And a handful of stocks we own like Cendant SEI Investments and Harrahs Entertainment are already UP to from Septembers lows More will follow As youll discover the pessimists are WRONG about the most important issue Were not headed for some deflationary death grip or worldwide economic disaster despite the evidence they cite Rather we are in the midst of economic change marked by harsh competition rapid innovation and hand wringing that is a STOCK PICKERS DREAM And in just a moment Ill share my finelyhoned strategy for marketbeating gains one that could easily make you RICHER by the end of the year SO PLEASE excuse me if I dont buy all the doom and gloom I respect the intelligence and opinions of the pessimists But for more than years Ive chosen to go my own waydiscover the facts on my ownand stand up for what I see In fact I visited countries on five continents last year I live part of the year in Europe just visited Argentina to size up that situation for myself and regularly spend weeks at a time in Greater China Why Because like it or not we truly live in a global economy And by understanding how it works I help my clients SAFELY GROW RICH HOW A timetested strategy that identifies hot growth prospects when the risk of owning them is near or at its lowest point Thats why the companies I choose span a host of industries but they all have four things in common Financials that show a company solidly in an upward trend Management with a laserlike focus on improving the bottom line Distinct competitive advantages within its market niche And a stock price selling at the low end of its usual trading range THATS THE ONLY WAY to invest for lowrisk fortune building gains And once you join me I know youll agree Ive just put the finishing touches on my annual list of PROFIT ROCKETS for my Investors World clients and thought you might want a peek as well In fact you can get it IMMEDIATELY with a few simple mouseclicks and RISKFREE as well Since I first issued this annual forecast back in my clients have really cleaned up shouldnt you make a pile of money this year too From the beginning of through the end of this annual portfolio of Profit Rockets has racked up a cumulative gain of Thats over a seven year period Do the division yourself and see how it looks NOT BAD And that time period includes the worst bear market of the last years we were actually UP another in Today I provide this portfolio solely to my Investors World clients But I first started making this annual forecast in as a regular panelist on Wall treet Week With Louis Rukeyser IN I was among over worldclass investors with gains of as audited by Bloomberg In I slipped to And in I just missed out on top honors with a NICE FAT GAIN And frankly Ive been helping investors like you to oversized gains for more than twenty years now When the pessimists cried that oil was going to a barrel in the s I led my clients to the rational truth and more big profits After the crash of I debated every pessimist I could find And back in with stocks in the dumps and the pessimists having a field day I told clients to buy for the greatest bull market in history I was right each time And Im staking my reputation and my own money on the wellconsidered belief that Im right again So please I urge you try my Investors World advisory RISKFREE As soon as you sign up youll get
