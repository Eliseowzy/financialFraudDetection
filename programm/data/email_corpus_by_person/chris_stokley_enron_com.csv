SentTuesday July PM ToISO Market Participants SubjectCAISO Notice Cash Allocation Policies ISO Market Participants Since Trade Month November which settled beginning in January payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than th e full amount due Scheduling Coordinators SCs in the monthly cash clearin g process The purpose of this message is to describe the ISOs policies a nd procedures in settling the market when defaults occur As set forth in Section SABP of the ISO Tariff when payment defaults occur from SCs that have obligations to the ISOs markets Debtor SCs the shortfall is t o be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them Creditor SCs based on thei r outstanding balances The principles that drive how amounts are settled a nd defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below Proportionate allocation of defaults The total amount of market defaults is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each Cr editor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount receivable for the month SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on a monthly basis as described below The intent of the Tariff is to equitably distri bute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net market receivables f or the period Each month is treated as a whole period Final and preliminary invoices ar e combined when possible see exception conditions below in allocating mar ket defaults Cash payments from the market are received in two stages pr eliminary and final At preliminary market payments are distributed base d on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the pr eliminary invoices Final invoices serve essentially as trueups to the pre liminary invoices and accordingly payments received at final are redistri buted to the extent possible to achieve trueup allocations for the whole m onth considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both the pr eliminary and final invoices Each month is treated as a discrete period Market defaults are generally allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being set tled The exceptions to this rule involve SCs that are Creditor SCs in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods o r Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for prior months In the first instance the Creditor SC would not be paid to the extent of default obligations from prior months Amounts due to the C reditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period I n the second instance the current months payment is carried back and appli ed first to the oldest outstanding balance The proceeds would be distribut ed to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs un paid balances in that month With respect to the carry back of payments to the earliest period Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from d ifferent SCs GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments GMC is billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final invoic es each month In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices at eit her preliminary or final market funds are transferred to satisfy GMC obli gations before any market distributions are made This first priority posi tion for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP of the ISO Tarif f Therefore when both GMC and market defaults occur as has occurred in each of the past few months the Creditor SCs have two reductions to the m arket clearing amounts ultimately paid an allocated portion of the GMC de fault and an allocated portion of the market default RMR invoices and pa yments are not affected by market or GMC defaults The RMR invoicing proce ss involves amounts due from the PTOs to the RMR Owners as set forth in mo nthly invoices processed through the ISOs systems However such amounts are invoiced independent of the ISOs market and GMC billing processes and accordingly market andor GMC defaults do not impact RMR related payments There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of alloca ting cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur Some of these factors inclu de amounts received after payment date deadlines such amounts are typicall y included in the next distribution market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the current mo nth such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount of the GMC default by the Creditor SC allocations to prior months not made unless the amount exceeds of that months billed amounts small invoices under are paid in full rather than the allocated pe rcentage For more information about these allocation issues or any other related mat ters please contact Melodie Iverson email aiso com mailto or Mike Epstein email m mailto at the ISO Byron B Woertz Jr Director

confirmed that Hertzberg had called Lynch asking for them to delay And of course the PUC accommodated them today Ann said however that she was not able to hold the decision until July The reason is that a letter from the Treasurer DWR and Finance was sent to Commissioners and legislators telling them that DA had to be suspended by June in order fo r appeals etc to be settled by the time the issue the bonds in August I believe someone else referenced this letter in an email yesterday Ann is appending the letter to the Bilas alternate so everyone can see it and comment Also they are going

Finals I spent several hours with TJ shadowing and we tested the code while I examined results As each error or incorrect result was noted we went to the code and walked through and made changes TJ is now running actual dates and we will check them in the morning When all is well we will run the rest of October Next we will perform the same testing and coding revisions for only need to test for EPMIside exceptions and then we will be able to run for the month After the latest unsuccessful run of I delved into the specific details of the variances and all of the material volumes are included in the Finals so any allocations that would be created as a result of those variances would be reversed when I run the Final actualization So this morning I manually calculated appropriate allocations for our Load customers the variances are due to resubmitted meter data entered the values in the ProRata allocation table created an additional allocation for the remaining MW variance matched all up to the ISO and completed for Preliminaries I have actualized the regular stuff and set to M through October I will wrap those up on Friday At this point in time we are on target for completion of

nearly complete Ran into an error while running a test day and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow should be a quick fix once we get the exceptions working properly I have actualized finals on the

scavenging he calls it the exception roll up function from another module He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions He has not yet done the scavenging part He will be finished with tonight and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions The part of that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling which should be a much less involved endeavor For I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance and how that variance was being allocated However these queries are currently beyond my expertise I plan to rectify that We are going to enlist Annas help as much as possible for and get to the bottom of what is happening As a side note for the time change date we have an extra HE and the ISO has HE We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that For the regular actualizations I have set except to M today There is a strange anomaly going on on the th and neither Donna nor I could figure out what I will get back to it Anticipate completion of all by

EEVd by MV they need to know for each value whether it is the actual metered amount or an estimated value Users understand that there may be missing data but do not require the metadata detailing this However this is with the understanding that the backfill data will eventually arrive at some later date We want any account and meterdescriptive data as well as the associated volumetric data A test file to see what kind of data are available and a few consecutive days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed If data is received from am how soon after am can we get a file Please do not burn in this process just yet because data and timing requirements may change Chris With the bullets above Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP by COB today or tomorrow morning Hopefully this will at least get the ball rolling It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and how to prioritze it There must be concerted effort from the business to prioritize requests to CSC Steve gave me Richard Millers name as the EES coordinator for these requests Please contact him and let me know what you find out Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for

July PM ToISO Market Participants SubjectCAISO Notice Cash Allocation Policies ISO Market Participants Since Trade Month November which settled beginning in January payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than th e full amount due Scheduling Coordinators SCs in the monthly cash clearin g process The purpose of this message is to describe the ISOs policies a nd procedures in settling the market when defaults occur As set forth in Section SABP of the ISO Tariff when payment defaults occur from SCs that have obligations to the ISOs markets Debtor SCs the shortfall is t o be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them Creditor SCs based on thei r outstanding balances The principles that drive how amounts are settled a nd defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below Proportionate allocation of defaults The total amount of market defaults is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each Cr editor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount receivable for the month SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on a monthly basis as described below The intent of the Tariff is to equitably distri bute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net market receivables f or the period Each month is treated as a whole period Final and preliminary invoices ar e combined when possible see exception conditions below in allocating mar ket defaults Cash payments from the market are received in two stages pr eliminary and final At preliminary market payments are distributed base d on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the pr eliminary invoices Final invoices serve essentially as trueups to the pre liminary invoices and accordingly payments received at final are redistri buted to the extent possible to achieve trueup allocations for the whole m onth considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both the pr eliminary and final invoices Each month is treated as a discrete period Market defaults are generally allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being set tled The exceptions to this rule involve SCs that are Creditor SCs in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods o r Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for prior months In the first instance the Creditor SC would not be paid to the extent of default obligations from prior months Amounts due to the C reditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period I n the second instance the current months payment is carried back and appli ed first to the oldest outstanding balance The proceeds would be distribut ed to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs un paid balances in that month With respect to the carry back of payments to the earliest period Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from d ifferent SCs GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments GMC is billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final invoic es each month In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices at eit her preliminary or final market funds are transferred to satisfy GMC obli gations before any market distributions are made This first priority posi tion for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP of the ISO Tarif f Therefore when both GMC and market defaults occur as has occurred in each of the past few months the Creditor SCs have two reductions to the m arket clearing amounts ultimately paid an allocated portion of the GMC de fault and an allocated portion of the market default RMR invoices and pa yments are not affected by market or GMC defaults The RMR invoicing proce ss involves amounts due from the PTOs to the RMR Owners as set forth in mo nthly invoices processed through the ISOs systems However such amounts are invoiced independent of the ISOs market and GMC billing processes and accordingly market andor GMC defaults do not impact RMR related payments There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of alloca ting cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur Some of these factors inclu de amounts received after payment date deadlines such amounts are typicall y included in the next distribution market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the current mo nth such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount of the GMC default by the Creditor SC allocations to prior months not made unless the amount exceeds of that months billed amounts small invoices under are paid in full rather than the allocated pe rcentage For more information about these allocation issues or any other related mat ters please contact Melodie Iverson email aiso com mailto or Mike Epstein email m mailto at the ISO Byron B Woertz Jr Director Client Relations Phone

Thursday August PM To Stokley Chris Cc Richter Jeff Herndon Rogers Black Don Subject Site Profile Consumption Issues in our contracts Chris As a follow up of our conversation here is a summary of contract issues I have tried to organize my comments into three major categories baseline bands and material change language Where Contracts were prior to Site Profile Desk took control Baseline Not specified in contracts A variety of mechanisms to build baseline postcontract including Calculating volumes on a forward basis ie first months Last months prior to contract closing Baseline volumes that grow by x Bands Annual bands Aggregation at all levels including utility state and national etc Material Change Language Varied unclear or vague language at least in my opinion Where we are now Baseline Two basic mechanisms intended to bring clarity Major Transactions ie any deal not priced from Matrix volumes explicitly specified in contract Minor transactions last months prior to contract closing with the understanding that Origination will collect bills required for booking within days of contract closing process details to be finalized Bands Monthly bands Aggregation allowed within same utilityvoltagefacility type groupings Material Change Language Unfortunately still unclear and inadequate see below for our proposals For example the Where we want to be Baseline Minor transactions A process needs to be in place in Services Department to collect the bills required for booking within days of contract closing Material Change Language This area needs to be really beefed up In my opinion material language should catch risks that are not explicitly modeled and priced At the moment I dont see material change language accomplishing this Issue Protecting for long term shifts in consumption The consumption bands which are set on monthly basis we are offering right now are intended to provide normal weather and operating flexibility With this assumption we currently price consumption risk as a probabilistic process as opposed to pricing using the classic straddle approach simultaneous call put Any step changes in consumption such as The Limited adding additional display area or Tyco Health Care Products adding new production shifts violate this assumption I propose either adding language that captures this steps or price these steps explicitly Given the lack of quality actual data the second alternative would be an educated guess at this point Recently I proposed verbally to be fair the following language to Jim Wood ProductsOrigination If a Material Change defined below has occurred EESO or Customer may request that the commodity pricing be restructured to account for such Material Change A Material Change shall be any intentional or unintentional change including energy efficiency upgrades to the processes or operations conducted at any of the Facilities or other similar occurrences that i change a Facility Accounts consumption of electricity or natural gas at such Facility Account by more than of the Facility Accounts Consumption Baseline over any six consecutive months ie Facility Accounts Actual Consumption divided by Facility Accounts Baseline Consumption equals less than or more than or ii change a Facility Account s monthly onpeak usage ratio for electricity at such Facility Account by more than of Facility Accounts monthly onpeak usage ratio baseline over any six consecutive months The Facility Account monthly onpeak usage ratio equals the monthly onpeak Facility Account usage divided by the total monthly Facility Account usage Jims immediate reaction was mixed He felt that customers may feel that we are giving them volumetric flexibility on one hand and taking it back with the other He said on material change may be more palatable Issue Sudden Load Swings in Short Term Although the monthly bands protect us on monthly volume swings they are not very effective in preventing sudden unplanned short term load swings triggering imbalance penalties Here the language currently in contracts that is supposed to protect us against this risk Notice of Operational Changes You agree to promptly advise us of any event reasonably known to you that may impact energy usage at any Account eg equipment installations outages shutdowns repairs openings or closings changes in operating hours by an amount without regard to weatherrelated effects greater than either i of the Actual Usage for such Account during the same Billing Cycle in the prior year or ii MW each an Operational Change If you fail to notify us of an Operational Change you will reimburse us for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by you or us as a result of such Operational Change This language has at least three problems No compensation mechanism specified if customer does not deliver on this requirement Is and or MW justifiable especially given the differences in imbalance treatment across physical markets No clear process ie minimum time frame for notice contact information specified for customer to deliver this notice I would modify this language to something like Notice of Operational Changes Customer agrees to advise EESI at least two days hours in advance to the contacts listed in Schedule by fax or email of any event that may impact energy demand at any of its Accounts eg equipment installations outages shutdowns repairs openings or closings changes in operating hours by an amount greater than either i of the Hourly Load for such Account during the same hour in the prior year or ii MW of demand each an Operational Change If such Customer fails to notify EESI of an Operational Change Customer will reimburse EESI for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by the Customer or EESI as a result of such Operational Change The mechanism for penalty calculation is specified in Schedule Hope this helps Mallik Forwarded by Mallik AvsHOUEES on AM Enron Energy Services From Mike D Smith AM

Thursday August AM To Stokley Chris Cc Richter Jeff Herndon Rogers Black Don Subject Site Profile Consumption Issues in our contracts Chris As a follow up of our conversation here is a summary of contract issues I have tried to organize my comments into three major categories baseline bands and material change language Where Contracts were prior to Site Profile Desk took control Baseline Not specified in contracts A variety of mechanisms to build baseline postcontract including Calculating volumes on a forward basis ie first months Last months prior to contract closing Baseline volumes that grow by x Bands Annual bands Aggregation at all levels including utility state and national etc Material Change Language Varied unclear or vague language at least in my opinion Where we are now Baseline Two basic mechanisms intended to bring clarity Major Transactions ie any deal not priced from Matrix volumes explicitly specified in contract Minor transactions last months prior to contract closing with the understanding that Origination will collect bills required for booking within days of contract closing process details to be finalized Bands Monthly bands Aggregation allowed within same utilityvoltagefacility type groupings Material Change Language Unfortunately still unclear and inadequate see below for our proposals For example the Where we want to be Baseline Minor transactions A process needs to be in place in Services Department to collect the bills required for booking within days of contract closing Material Change Language This area needs to be really beefed up In my opinion material language should catch risks that are not explicitly modeled and priced At the moment I dont see material change language accomplishing this Issue Protecting for long term shifts in consumption The consumption bands which are set on monthly basis we are offering right now are intended to provide normal weather and operating flexibility With this assumption we currently price consumption risk as a probabilistic process as opposed to pricing using the classic straddle approach simultaneous call put Any step changes in consumption such as The Limited adding additional display area or Tyco Health Care Products adding new production shifts violate this assumption I propose either adding language that captures this steps or price these steps explicitly Given the lack of quality actual data the second alternative would be an educated guess at this point Recently I proposed verbally to be fair the following language to Jim Wood ProductsOrigination If a Material Change defined below has occurred EESO or Customer may request that the commodity pricing be restructured to account for such Material Change A Material Change shall be any intentional or unintentional change including energy efficiency upgrades to the processes or operations conducted at any of the Facilities or other similar occurrences that i change a Facility Accounts consumption of electricity or natural gas at such Facility Account by more than of the Facility Accounts Consumption Baseline over any six consecutive months ie Facility Accounts Actual Consumption divided by Facility Accounts Baseline Consumption equals less than or more than or ii change a Facility Account s monthly onpeak usage ratio for electricity at such Facility Account by more than of Facility Accounts monthly onpeak usage ratio baseline over any six consecutive months The Facility Account monthly onpeak usage ratio equals the monthly onpeak Facility Account usage divided by the total monthly Facility Account usage Jims immediate reaction was mixed He felt that customers may feel that we are giving them volumetric flexibility on one hand and taking it back with the other He said on material change may be more palatable Issue Sudden Load Swings in Short Term Although the monthly bands protect us on monthly volume swings they are not very effective in preventing sudden unplanned short term load swings triggering imbalance penalties Here the language currently in contracts that is supposed to protect us against this risk Notice of Operational Changes You agree to promptly advise us of any event reasonably known to you that may impact energy usage at any Account eg equipment installations outages shutdowns repairs openings or closings changes in operating hours by an amount without regard to weatherrelated effects greater than either i of the Actual Usage for such Account during the same Billing Cycle in the prior year or ii MW each an Operational Change If you fail to notify us of an Operational Change you will reimburse us for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by you or us as a result of such Operational Change This language has at least three problems No compensation mechanism specified if customer does not deliver on this requirement Is and or MW justifiable especially given the differences in imbalance treatment across physical markets No clear process ie minimum time frame for notice contact information specified for customer to deliver this notice I would modify this language to something like Notice of Operational Changes Customer agrees to advise EESI at least two days hours in advance to the contacts listed in Schedule by fax or email of any event that may impact energy demand at any of its Accounts eg equipment installations outages shutdowns repairs openings or closings changes in operating hours by an amount greater than either i of the Hourly Load for such Account during the same hour in the prior year or ii MW of demand each an Operational Change If such Customer fails to notify EESI of an Operational Change Customer will reimburse EESI for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by the Customer or EESI as a result of such Operational Change The mechanism for penalty calculation is specified in Schedule Hope this helps Mallik Forwarded by Mallik AvsHOUEES on AM Enron Energy Services From Mike D Smith AM

July PM To Stokley Chris Cc Bresnan Neil Richter Jeff Subject Meeting you would be interested in I am forwarding emails relevant to the Team Ranger initiative from the time I became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited My understanding from my notes and recollections and a discussion with Glen Matthys this morning is as follows Team Ranger is cosponsored by Greg Young Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer Team Rangers objective is to capture all the data necessary for Ruffer to provide flash reports to Mills on what should liquidated from the risk book vs actual costs and revenues experienced Youngs involved because his Operations group provides the link to CSCs billing and invoicing systems Since I had been discussing my forecasting data needs and RPS tieins with Scott he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope Clearly I was outvoted since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to CSC and which will enable flash report development quickly for power only an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables The system will pull down monthly data from STAT and LodeStar billing systems on a daily frequency and will still provide some valuable information for me The data collected for Team Ranger will be housed in an Enroncontrolled database not CSCs supposedly for easy access to Enron users Chris this clearly falls in the realm we were discussing last night a limited scope silo initiative to solve a localized problem Like I said Im a culprit too if no one else wants to provide the data I need Ill pull it myself just as you counseled a month ago when we were struggling to get answers from CSC via Operations I admit you were right weve gotten more data since then with access privileges than I could have wrangled out of requests to CSC in six months despite California Let me know what else you need from me to facilitate your efforts Please keep me updated with what you learn and where we stand Ill do the same Michael Forwarded

extremely informative Chris Original Message From Frazier Michael Sent Wednesday July PM To Stokley Chris Cc Bresnan Neil Richter Jeff Subject Meeting you would be interested in I am forwarding emails relevant to the Team Ranger initiative from the time I became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited My understanding from my notes and recollections and a discussion with Glen Matthys this morning is as follows Team Ranger is cosponsored by Greg Young Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer Team Rangers objective is to capture all the data necessary for Ruffer to provide flash reports to Mills on what should liquidated from the risk book vs actual costs and revenues experienced Youngs involved because his Operations group provides the link to CSCs billing and invoicing systems Since I had been discussing my forecasting data needs and RPS tieins with Scott he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope Clearly I was outvoted since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to CSC and which will enable flash report development quickly for power only an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables The system will pull down monthly data from STAT and LodeStar billing systems on a daily frequency and will still provide some valuable information for me The data collected for Team Ranger will be housed in an Enroncontrolled database not CSCs supposedly for easy access to Enron users Chris this clearly falls in the realm we were discussing last night a limited scope silo initiative to solve a localized problem Like I said Im a culprit too if no one else wants to provide the data I need Ill pull it myself just as you counseled a month ago when we were struggling to get answers from CSC via Operations I admit you were right weve gotten more data since then with access privileges than I could have wrangled out of requests to CSC in six months despite California Let me know what else you need from me to facilitate your efforts Please keep me updated with what you learn and where we stand Ill do the same Michael Forwarded by Michael FrazierHOUEES on PM Enron Energy Services From Scott Mills AM To Michael ES cc Subject Meeting you would be interested in There is a meeting scheduled for Monday see below to discuss information that must be provided by CSC and Avista so that we can start tying out what is actually billed to what is in the

Williams III Bill Wolfe Greg Subject Energy Novice to Be Paid Good work if you can find it Wednesday July Energy Novice to Be Paid Power Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one years experience in the field State officials say she is doing a good job By JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY Times Staff Writers The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a years experience in the energy industry annually to head a team of traders who secure Californias daily electricity supply State officials hired Susan T Lee in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov Gray Davis Lees contract is equal to the a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor S David Freeman a top utility executive for decades The twoyear contract will pay Lee up to to oversee the states daytoday energy purchases totaling billions of dollars a year Lees contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nations largest power buyers a role that it took on in January as Californias utilities faltered Lees contract was one of about a dozen released Monday and among the largest Reached at her Sacramento office Lee would not discuss her contract She said only that she heads a person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep Californias power flowing Pete Garris a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu her boss at Mieco Inc a trading firm in Long Beach recommended her Shimizu refused comment Tuesday The state according to Garris must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary Garris said Unless we can get permanent and fulltime positions approved these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire consultants Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lees contract with the sixmonth deal that Freemanthe former boss at several major utilitiesstruck with the governor I dont want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman Garris said David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a private power marketer With Susan we just followed the standard formula In her new job Lee will direct an immensely complicated aroundtheclock operation responsible for procuring energy scheduling power and associated transmission and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries according to her contract Lees resume attached to the contract shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March when she joined Mieco There she was a trader and power scheduler not a manager She was only here for a year or so said Dina Alvarez an administrative manager for the company A graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco Lees contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field She is being paid an hour and can earn a maximum of including expenses by April Another new consultant William L Green has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration Pacific Gas Electric and the California Independent System Operator He is being paid an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the states accounting of energy purchases His twoyear deal is worth up to They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals Richard Ferreira the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District has a contract and is being paid an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts He worked for the Department of Water Resources for years before joining the Sacramento agency in Hardy Energy Consulting also has a sixmonth contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid an hour Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration where he was chief executive officer from to Lees recruiter Garris said her lack of experience is not a concern So far shes done an excellent job he said She has the skills and she has the ability She was doing a similar job Dozens of consultants including Lee have been hired since January when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric because they were no longer considered creditworthy said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Hidalgo said that about of the people now working for the division are consultants The rest are state employees As part of the process Lees unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months
