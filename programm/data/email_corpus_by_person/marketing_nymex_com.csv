of EnergyNotice March To All NYMEX Division Members NYMEX Division Member Firms From J Robert Collins Jr President Re Request for assistance in communicating the importance of the weekly natural gas storage report to the Department of Energy The US Department of Energy Energy Information Administration EIA will take over the release of the weekly natural gas storage report from the American Gas Association this spring Since its inception in the survey has been an important source of ongoing changes in the supply and demand of natural gas and plays an important role in the transparency of the market While at the present time the report is released during open outcry trading hours the Exchange has reason to believe that the EIA is leaning toward releasing the numbers in the late afternoon or on the weekend Officials at the EIA have said they believe this will minimize the volatility in the marketplace It is the firm belief of the Exchange that releasing the weekly storage report in the offhours will only increase market volatility upon the resumption of open outcry trading will limit market transparency and would put many market participants at a disadvantage In the interests of market transparency and fairness the Exchange is concerned that the report be released during open outcry trading hours when the market is most liquid and has suggested a time of AM The Exchange has made its position known in written comments to the Department of Energy EIA Administrator Mary Hutzler has said that the Exchange appears to be the only interested party that feels strongly about releasing the data during regular trading hours It is important that market participants particularly commercial entities contact the EIA on this issue I urge you and your customers to call Ms Hutzler and cordially explain how important it is to have the information made available during regular daytime trading hours preferably AM Please make the following points The weekly inventory report is an important source of information regarding changes in the supply and demand of natural gas It is currently released to coincide with regular daytime trading hours of the natural gas futures market Wide participation in the New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures market by commercial buyers and sellers from all segments of the industry has made the futures contract the North American pricing benchmark The release of the report in the late in the afternoon or early in the morning when the trading floor is closed will put most market participants at a distinct disadvantage to those firms who have trading desks manned round the clock The release of the information in the off hours could also increase volatility at the opening of the market having the opposite of the desired effect In the interests of fairness and market transparency it is vital that the statistics continue to be released according to current practice during daytime trading one of the most active times of the day is shortly after the market open or about AM If you prefer to fax Ms Hutzler at or email we have provided the following recommended language Ms Mary Hutzler Administrator Energy Information Administration US Department of Energy Washington DC Dear Ms Hutzler Since its inception in the American Gas Associations weekly inventory survey has been an important source of ongoing changes in the supply and demand of natural gas and has fulfilled an important role in assuring the transparency of the market We understand that the reporting function will be assumed by the Energy Information Administration this spring and wish to urge that in the interest of market fairness and efficiency that the weekly report continue to be released during regular daytime trading hours of the natural gas futures market Wide participation in the New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures market by commercial buyers and sellers of gas from all segments of the industry has made the futures contract the North American pricing benchmark for this important energy resource For this reason we feel that it is vital that the statistics continue to be released according to current practice during regular daytime trading hours the most active trading period Typically one of the most active times of the day would be shortly after the market opens about AM A release of the inventory figures in the late afternoon or on the weekend would primarily benefit the major companies that can afford to man roundtheclock trading desks because they will be able to react immediately while smaller firms will have to wait until the market opens on the following business day It has been our experience that the release of marketmoving news in the offhours often increases market volatility at the market open We urge you to maintain the current practice of releasing this information during daytime trading Thank you for your consideration Sincerely

Clearing Members From J Robert Collins Jr President Re NYMEX CME Partner to Offer Emini Energy Futures The New York Mercantile Exchange Inc NYMEX and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc CME today announced at a joint news conference in New York that they have reached a cooperative agreement to offer newly created Emini versions of key NYMEX energy futures contracts for trading on CMEs GLOBEX electronic trading platform and clearing at the NYMEX Clearing House The first Emini energy contracts will begin trading in the summer officials of the exchanges said The agreement calls for the two exchanges to launch smaller electronically traded versions of NYMEXs crude oil natural gas heating oil and gasoline futures contracts Precious metals contracts may be introduced in subsequent phases Modeled after CMEs popular line of Emini stock index contracts which are onefifth the size of the standardsized contracts the new Emini energy and precious metals futures would be a tobedetermined fraction of the size of the standardsized NYMEX contracts Under the crossaccess program CME members will be granted access to GLOBEX to trade the Emini versions of the energy futures products and to NYMEX ACCESS to trade NYMEX Division products listed on that system subject to the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm CME members who are not members of NYMEX will receive discounts for these trades Similarly NYMEX members will receive access to GLOBEX and discounts on fees for CME products traded on GLOBEX with a CME member firm guarantee and for the Emini energy products with the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm The Exchange officials said that a crossmargining program will provide capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary accounts by combining the positions at joint or affiliated clearing members in baskets of CME and NYMEX or COMEX Division commodities the new Emini energy products and GSCI futures and options into a single portfolio The riskbased performance bond margining systems of each clearing organization will then determine a single performance bond requirement across both markets Vincent Viola NYMEX Chairman said This deal will bring our successful energy products to a broad retail user base through the GLOBEX distribution network as well as expand the opportunities and cost efficiencies for participants in both markets This is an innovative new development in the futures industry that builds on the longstanding relationship between our exchanges said CME Chairman Scott Gordon With this cooperation agreement we are blending CMEs successful Emini concept our GLOBEX infrastructure and global distribution network with NYMEXs proven product line established liquidity and customer relationships in these markets NYMEX President J Robert Collins Jr said In we have seen a increase in natural gas futures over the same period last year as well as a increase in overall energy futures trading By reducing the size of the contract unit we hope to emulate the CMEs success in expanding the trading community for our most liquid markets Tremendous synergy has been developed between the open outcry and electronic trading in our stock index markets since CME first introduced the Emini SP futures contract in and the Emini Nasdaq contract in said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty By expanding GLOBEX distribution to the NYMEX floor and leveraging our existing distribution channels we hope to build on our previous success enhance market liquidity and expand the customer base for energy and potentially metals futures Unlike their standardsized counterparts the new Emini products will be cashsettled to the respective NYMEX futures contract month final settlement price on the last day of trading Two contract months will trade at any given time GLOBEX is an open access electronic trading platform that displays the book to any qualified market participant with the ability to route orders to the system The book represents the ability to view bids and offers in the market Under the agreement market participants interested in trading the new products will be designated qualified if they are guaranteed by a NYMEX clearing member firm In addition NYMEX members and customers trading the new products on GLOBEX will have access to CMEs electronically traded products subject to the guarantee of a CME clearing firm In addition to the extensive distribution network and connectivity alternatives of GLOBEX the exchanges will work together to provide NYMEX members and customers with access to GLOBEX both on the NYMEX trading floor and around the world Points of access will include GLOBEX TraderSMDirect terminals placed on the NYMEX trading floor adjacent to the pit enhancing liquidity and providing trading opportunities similar to CMEs Emini equity index complex on its trading floor NYMEX and CME jointly developed CLEARING the clearing platform operated at both exchanges for highvolume highcapacity
