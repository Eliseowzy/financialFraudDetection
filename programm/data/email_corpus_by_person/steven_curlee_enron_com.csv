bottle of Scotch that he wanted behind the counter on the shelf He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well but he refused and said Because I dont believe you are over The robber said he was but the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didnt believe him At this point the robber took his drivers license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk The clerk looked it over and agreed that the man was in fact over and he put the Scotch in the bag The robber then ran from the store with his loot The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off the license They arrested the robber two hours later RUNNERUP A woman was reporting her car as stolen and mentioned that there was a car phone in it The policeman taking the report called

a downtown Bank of America walked into the branch and wrote this iz a stikkup Put all your muny in this bag While standing in line waiting to give his note to the teller he began to worry that someone

handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller She read it and surmising from his spelling errors that he was not the brightest light in the harbor told him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America Looking somewhat defeated the man said OK and left The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested the man a few minutes later as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America RUNNERUP From England A motorist was unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that measured his speed using radar and photographed his car He later received in the mail a ticket for Pounds and a photo of his car Instead of payment he sent the police department a photograph of pounds Several days later he received a letter from the police that contained another picture of handcuffs The motorist promptly sent the money for the fine RUNNERUP Drug Possession Defendant Christopher Jansen on trial in March in Pontiac Michigan said he had been searched without a warrant The prosecutor said the officer didnt need a warrant because a bulge in Christophers jacket could have been a gun Nonsense said Christopher who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court He handed it over so the judge could see it The judge discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket and laughed so hard he required a five minute recess to compose himself RUNNERUP Oklahoma City Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed robbery of a convenience store in district court when he fired his lawyer Assistant District Attorney Larry Jones said Newton was doing a fair job of defending himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the robber

convict Newton and recommended a year sentence RUNNERUP Detroit RC Gaitlan walked up to two patrol officers who were showing their squad car computer felonlocation equipment to children in a Detroit neighborhood When he asked how the system worked the officer asked him for identification Gaitlan gave them his drivers license they entered it into the computer and moments later they arrested Gaitlan because information on the screen showed Gaitlan was wanted for a twoyearold armed robbery in St Louis Missouri RUNNERUP Another from Detroit A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously waving revolvers The first one shouted Nobody move When his partner moved the startled first bandit shot him THE WINNER A Charlotte NC man having purchased a case of very rare very expensive cigars insured them against fire among other things Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made even his first premium payment on the policy the man filed a claim against the insurance company In his claim the man stated the cigars were lost in a series of small fires The insurance company refused to pay citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion The man sued and won In delivering the ruling the judge agreeing that the claim was frivolous stated nevertheless that the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure against fire without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire and was obligated to pay the claim Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man for the rare cigars he lost in the fires After the man cashed the check however the company had him arrested on counts of arson With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him the man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and sentenced to months in jail and a fine
