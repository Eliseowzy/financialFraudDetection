today IN THE MONEY Enron From Energy Trader To Spinmeister By Carol S Remond Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column This column was originally published Wednesday NEW YORK Dow Jones With the value of its stock continuing to plummet E nron Corp ENE tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press r elease touting among other things increased liquidity The problem is that most of the socalled news was three days old recycled from the companys latest quarterly filing And investors werent fooled by the release Although the stock of the emba ttled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the rele ase climbing to a share from it quickly gave up most of its g ains One hour after the release Enron stock was back trading at a s hare down more than on the day They had to say something but really didnt have any new news Its quite incredible said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron Amid mounting fears that Enrons credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc DYN a merger that many see as the only way for E nron to avoid possible bankruptcy Enron began its press release by announc ing that it has closed on the remaining million of a previously annou nced billion in secured credit lines Great news given the way Enron has been burning through cash Except that investors who took time to read Enrons filing with the Securities and Exch ange Commission on Monday already knew that on November Enron cl osed a million new secured line of credit which will mature in the fo urth quarter of Readers of the companys Q also knew that the million credit was secured by the assets of Enrons Northern Natural Gas Co Meanwhile the real news everyone was waiting for an announcement about wh ether a million loan due next Tuesday had been extended has yet to be finalized Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to midDecembe r would be formalized soon Separately people familiar with the matter said JP Morgan Chase Co an d Citigroup Inc continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the syndicated loan which contains a clause that unbeknownst to many was tri ggered by Enrons ratings downgrade to BBB by Standard Poors Corp ea rlier this month The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the million note on November if it didnt post collateral Those people said that the syndicated loan which is built inside a structu red vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors around the world would likely be extended to the middle of when other bank loans to Enron come due About billion of Enrons billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May and will likely need to be re structured About million of the assets securing the million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan reducing the o utstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured according to the people familiar with the terms Meanwhile Dynegy also tried to rally although somewhat halfheartedly inv estors around its plan to acquire Enrons stock Dynegy said it was encoura ged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining million credit facil ity and news of the extension of the million loan Under the terms of the acquisition Enron holders would receive Dynegy share for each E nron share Investors however remain more circumspect unmoved by the whopping r isk premium currently attached to the merger Thats how much investors bu ying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come analys ts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enrons liquidity or lac k thereof going forward Were having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion from the banks even with the billion from Dynegy will provide enough liquid ity for Enron one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron Chevron Texaco w hich owns of Dynegy already injected billion into Enron Another billion is expected upon closing of the deal Carol S Remond Dow Jones Newswires om USA Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs By Ellen Chang Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Nov Reuters Houstons economy buffered by a broad and dive rse tax base should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t he citys major corporations including energy powerhouse Enron Corp econ omists and analysts said Financially ailing Enron Corp which has employees worldwide and i s in talks to be bought by Houstonbased rival Dynegy Inc is the third m ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m onths Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs Continental announced a layoff of employees after the Sept attack s and HewlettPackard Cos plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp will if fina lized result in layoffs at the two companies Compaq also announced layoffs worldwide in July Its fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co ntinental taken alone are negative factors although probably small in th e grand scope of the Houston economy said Phil Scheps director of Housto ns finance and administration department Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships the energ y giants market share has steadily eroded While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l ayoffs that could hit Houston Barton Smith director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston said the layoffs will b e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive Robin Kapiloff an analyst at Moodys Investors Service said the citys ef forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu e collections even as some of the citys biggest employers suffer Were watching to see where things go now she said Alex Fraser a director at Standard Poors said the ratings agency isnt concerned about Houstons credit position at this point While Enron is c ertainly a large player and prominent corporation were unclear on what th e impact would be While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow n since the Sept attacks Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati on With a tax base of billion in Houston is also buffered by the T exas Medical Center the citys largest employer Next year the citys tax base is estimated to grow to billion Still the national recession energy price weakness in general and the in itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to percent from percent That revised estimate equals a million reduction in the citys bi llion budget But the citys property tax revenue has not been affected Only a small cha nge in property tax collections is expected in because valuations are based on Jan data and for most of real estate growth was very larg e Scheps said While recent economic indicators appear positive and consumer confidence h as quickly rebounded a better read on the strength of Houstons tax revenu e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for the December holiday season Scheps said Meeting in Singapore to discuss Enrons arbitration proceedings against Ind ian state Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved NEW DELHI India AP A panel of arbitrators will meet in Singapore on Sa turday to discuss legal action by Enron Corp against the western Indian st ate of Maharashtra an Enron official said The Houstonbased company has a percent stake in the Dabhol Power Projec t in western India and is locked in a dispute with the Maharashtra State E lectricity Board over unpaid electricity charges The Singapore meeting is likely to be followed by arbitration in a London c ourt Dow Jones Newswires reported quoting an unidentified Enron official on Friday The company suspended operation of the power plant in May and now plans to withdraw from India Enron has invested about dlrs billion in equity of the megawatt of power project the largest ever foreign investment in India Enron sold electricity produced from naphtha to its sole customer the gove rnmentowned power utility in Maharashtra which found the costs too high The company also served notice to the federal government for not honoring a contract that required the government it to cover the Maharashtra state po wer utilitys unpaid dues Earlier this year Enrons chairman Kenneth Lay wrote to Indian Prime Minis ter Atal Bihari Vajpayee threatening to sue the government for up to dlrs billion if it did not resolve the dispute Dabhol Power Co initiated arbitration against the state government for not honoring guarantees on power bills due for December and

Wall Street Journal quoted a person familiar with the merger plans as saying Dynegy representatives plan to work through the weekend evaluating the impo rtance of this new information as part of the companys due diligence on En ron the source said without specifying what the new information was In the filing Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possibility that its weakening financ ial condition could force it to repay more than bln usd in loans by the e nd of the year Dynegy announced Wednesday that it is working to accelerate regulatory appr ovals required to complete the acquisition in accordance with the previousl y announced agreement The Journal quoted analysts as saying Dynegy is coming under increasing pre ssure to

bankruptcycourt filing is highly possible jms For more information and to contact AFX wwwafxnewscom and wwwafxpre sscom Dynegys Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes Dow Jones Business News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp Dynegy Inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult ibilliondollar deal Fridays Wall Street Journal reported The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron E NE shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energytradin g company the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas Du ring the past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revi sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billio n reduction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC filing Monday Enron disclosed hu ndreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possib ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t han billion in loans by the end of the year As of pm Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares fell or to each after having dropped Tuesday In excess of million shares traded Wednesday more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock Enrons bonds also again traded sharpl y lower market observers said The turmoil spilled over to Dynegys stock which also was among the most a ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange As of pm Wednesday Dyne gy DYN shares fell to each On Wednesday Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi ve Chuck Watson said his company was working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued to perform due diligence on Enr on Under the merger agreement Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enrons financial and legal problems become severe e nough However some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so called material adverse change clauses They point to a decision earlier th is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc to c omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc even though Tyson a Springdale Ark foodproducts company had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBPs earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit Dynegy officials didnt return calls seeking comment To complete the deal twothirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou ld have to give their approval No dates for those votes have been set One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr on contained information Dynegy hadnt known about Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i nformation as part of the companys due diligence this person said It cou ldnt be determined what the new information was The merger agreement announced Nov calls for Dynegy to exchange share for each of Enrons roughly million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about each or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerformula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme nt when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra ding relatively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houstonbased Dynegy Dynegy and Enron officia ls have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about Dynegy share for each Enron share Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Financial Post Investing Enron casts pall on analysts Everyone had a buy on the stock all the way down Steve Maich Financial Post with files from news services National Post National IN Front c National Post All Rights Reserved For thousands of people burned by Enron Corps spectacular implosion it m ust have been tough to feel thankful yesterday Over the past month the Houstonbased company has admitted its earnings re ports going back four years are useless written down billions in worthless investments and fired its chief financial officer in a failed bid to shor e up its plunging stock The slide in Enrons stock ENENYSE has already wiped out USbillion i n shareholder wealth Now it may lose its last lifeline a USbillion takeover offer from Dynegy Inc Enrons fall is proving to be more than just a cautionary tale about sketch y accounting The case is raising serious questions about the responsibilit y of analysts who strongly recommended a stock that many now admit they nev er really understood The public isnt going to trust stock analysts for awhile said Scott Pre ston a San Franciscobased analyst with Research Capital Corp who does no t cover Enron Every analyst had a buy on the stock And its not like the re was only one little issue there Its a mess and big brokerages were com ing out as it was on the way down saying put this thing in your Grandmother s RRSP But Wall Streets embarrassment pales next to the pain of shareholders inc luding Enron employees whose pensions were loaded with the stock I have lost my savings my plans for the future everything Roy Rinard a longtime Enron staffer said this week as he announced that employees ha ve banded together for a classaction lawsuit against the company Several analysts have acknowledged that Enrons financial statements were r outinely incomprehensible But with brokerages vying for the millions of do llars in equity and bond underwriting business Enron provided every year m any analysts chose to focus on the companys growth and failed to ask toug h questions about its books Critics say the red flags were waving long ago The first clear sign of trouble came Aug when Jeffrey Skilling quit th e CEO job he took over just seven months earlier citing personal reasons Former chief executive Kenneth Lay reclaimed the job Our business is stro ng and our growth prospects have never been better Mr Lay said at the ti me In fact cracks were already appearing in the business Enrons plan to sta rt trading capacity on fibre optic networks was a costly failure and the c ompany was locked in a prolonged dispute with the Indian government over en ergy purchases in the region In October Enron surprised investors by reporting its first quarterly loss in more than four years due in large part to the writedown of USbillio n in bad investments Within a week the US Securities and Exchange Commi ssion started investigating Enrons finances The company soon admitted major accounting errors dating back to Its profits had been overstated by USmillion or The company revealed that some of the investments it had written off were limited partnerships headed by CFO Andrew Fastow a serious breach of good corporate governanc e Mr Fastow was fired but it didnt stop Enrons descent The pain may be far from over Facing a year of regulatory hearings to approve the merger and a rapidly d evaluing asset in Enron many fear Dynegy will walk away from the deal If that happens Enron may be doomed The stock closed Wednesday at US down this year Dynegy closed at US valuing the Enron offer at US a share The fact that Enron s stock is trading so far below the offer price is a sure sign that invest ors doubt it will proceed at least not at the current offer price All this has left investors wondering how so many could have been so wrong about so much And how can so many continue to endorse the stock Of the analysts that cover the stock still rate it a buy Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleisher removed Enron from his recommended list this w eek but only after his firm was excluded from the banking syndicate arrang ing the Dynegy deal Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities dropped Enron from buy to sell this week citing its long history of

been sue d by members of its employeeretirement plan which has suffered losses bec ause of Enrons plummeting stock price Two separate lawsuits filed in federal court in Houston allege Enron misl ed participants in its k retirement plan about the risks of investing in the companys shares and note that the company forced the employees to r emain invested in its stock even as the shares fell Amid growing disclosur es of financial problems in recent weeks the company locked down the ret irement plan from Oct to Nov to make administrative changes which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed Enron which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc Houston becaus e of mounting financial problems has seen its stock price fall to on Wednesday from a peak of nearly a share last year The decline has bee n costly to participants in Enrons retirement plan because more than o f the k assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year according to one of the suits The first suit was filed Nov on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison Wright LLP a Houston law firm and the second was filed Tuesda y by Seattlebased Hagens Berman LLP Both seek classaction certification Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits A sp okeswoman also said the companys k plan offers participants invest ment choices one of which is company stock The companys stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive offbalancesheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials The Securities and Exchange Commission has la unched a formal investigation into the companys accounting and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c ompanies over losses in the companystock portion of their k plans Th e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu ing to offer company stock even after they became aware of serious busines s problems that would hurt the stock price All the suits are pending As with most of these companies Enron matches employee contributions to th e k with shares of Enron stock and also offers Enron stock as an inve stment choice in addition to a variety of mutual funds About billion of the plans billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e nd of according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison Pamela Tittle a participant in the k plan who worked in the finance d epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso n Wright had roughly shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou nt and has suffered losses of about as a result of the stocks dec line The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron k plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril The suit filed by Hagens Berman also alleges that the company failed to wa rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock In additi on it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result s since in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the SEC Roy E Rinard a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th e suit filed by Hagens Berman has seen the value of his retirement plan fa ll to from largely as a result of the decline in Enrons stock I feel like I have been betrayed Mr Rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers I lost my savings my plans for the future everyt hing Under federal pension law companies are allowed to offer their own stock i n retirement plans and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto ck Enron doesnt let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat ching contributions to the k plan until age However plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes ts of the participants which includes choosing prudent investments Genera lly to prove that the plans administrators breached their fiduciary dutie s employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen t This presents a high hurdle so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in k plans have generally come in the wa ke of allegations of accounting irregularities Lynn Sarko one of Ms Tittles attorneys with Seattles Keller Rohrback LL P is also colead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies Inc Murray Hill NJ Another firm representing Ms Tittle is Dalton Got to Samson Kilgard PLC which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik on Office Solutions Inc Malvern Pa The two law firms are representing M s Tittle with Campbell Harrison Wright The suits against Lucent and Ikon like the suit against Enron allege that thencurrent plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price Repr esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didnt require employee s to invest in the company stock and educated employees about the need for diversification The suit in which Mr Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct a day afte r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling billion in the third quarter Enron locked down the k plans asse ts preventing participants from selling Enron shares A lockdown occur s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another and generally lasts several weeks during which time participants cant mak e changes in their investment choices The lockdown was lifted on Nov In the interim on Nov Enron annou nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from through By the time the lockdown was lifted as a result o f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below a share from on Oct when the lockup started Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s aid They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci ng some really bad news Mr Barth said Mr Rinards looking at having n o retirement savings now Its a horrible thing to have to start over in yo ur s Enron says sorry as shares keep falling Energy Compass c Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved Investors in Enron must be wondering when their luck will change The compa nys shares were sent tumbling again this week after the company revealed t hat its credit crunch was worse than many investors thought The news spurr ed talk that rival energy trader Dynegy may have to inject more cash under its plan to buy Enron or could even walk away from the deal In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enron sa id it must pay down a million note by Nov because of the recent do wngrade of its credit rating Unless Enron repays the note or posts a lette r of credit the unidentified creditor can start liquidating Enron assets These include CEG Rio a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron is a lready in the process of selling to pay down other debt At the market close on Tuesday Enron shares stood at share about below Dynegys bid price of share and a fraction of the pe ak reached in August when the company was in its assetlight pomp At least Enron is trying to say sorry sort of In a conference call with analysts and investors last week chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay indicated regret for the series of bad investments in noncore businesses t hat has nearly bankrupted the big energy trading company In hindsight we made some very bad investments in some noncore businesses Lay acknowled ged I could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks This has resulted in a complete loss of investor confidence And via the Dynegy deal a complete loss of Enron independence although e ven that is not cut and dried If Enron fails to settle the million de bt repayment next week its credit rating would likely be reduced to subin vestment or junk status And if that happened it would qualify as a mat erial adverse change allowing Dynegy to pull out of the merger if it want ed to Analysts doubt things will get this bad still giving the deal a chance of going through BusinessFinancial Desk Section C From Sunbeam to Enron Andersens Reputation Suffers By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem ent case Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar thur Andersen in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the companys reported profits in recent years All of which raises the question Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee p of the accounting industry It is not an easy question to answer and not everyone is willing to rush t o judgment If you want to attack Andersen for Enron you need to know mo re than we know Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said this week But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases it is materiality In all three cases Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea d Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble The idea is that it doesnt much matter if a few little things we re gotten wrong But they can add up At Enron however they did not add up to that much a total of milli on over four years The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated It is not cle ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time To those who treasure the role of auditors the humiliation of Andersen is painful Back in the s it was Leonard Spacek Andersens managing par tner who warned that the professions existence is in peril because it was not showing enough independence His public prodding was crucial in ma king the industry do a better job Two decades ago when the issue on the t able was pension accounting Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules Now Andersens backbone is open to question It was evidence that senior pe ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the SEC to bring that suit which the firm chose to settle without a dmitting it had done anything wrong The partner that the SEC says looke d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations and Andersen says h e acted properly Lynn Turner who was chief accountant of the SEC at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un iversity says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap pened to Coopers Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s eries of highly publicized blown audits We got bludgeoned to death in the press he said People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps It was brutal but we deserved it We h ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting For Andersen to avoid that fate its relatively new chief executive Joseph Berardino who declined to be interviewed for this column will need to se t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr Spacek epitomized And then he will have to convince the public of that Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp Dynegy Inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult ibilliondollar deal The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energytrading comp any the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas During t he past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revised do wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billion redu ction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC filing Monday Enron disclosed hu ndreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possib ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t han billion in loans by the end of the year As of pm Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares fell or to each after having dropped Tuesday In excess of million shares traded Wednesday more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock Enrons bonds also again traded sharpl y lower market observers said The turmoil spilled over to Dynegys stock which also was among the most a ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange As of pm Wednesday Dyne gy shares fell to each On Wednesday Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi ve Chuck Watson said his company was working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued to perform due diligence on Enr on Under the merger agreement Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enrons financial and legal problems become severe e nough However some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so called material adverse change clauses They point to a decision earlier th is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc to c omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc even though Tyson a Springdale Ark foodproducts company had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBPs earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit Dynegy officials didnt return calls seeking comment To complete the deal twothirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou ld have to give their approval No dates for those votes have been set One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr on contained information Dynegy hadnt known about Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i nformation as part of the companys due diligence this person said It cou ldnt be determined what the new information was The merger agreement announced Nov calls for Dynegy to exchange share for each of Enrons roughly million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about each or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerformula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme nt when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra ding relatively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houstonbased Dynegy Dynegy and Enron officia ls have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about Dynegy share for each Enron share Such a ratcheting down wouldnt be without precedent in the deal According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations Dynegy reduced the ex change formula at least once prior to the Nov announcement because of En rons rapidly sinking stock price which at the beginning of this year was above a share In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street Go ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy A longtime Enron fan Mr Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha t the merger would help Dynegys earnings and whether Enron could recover the significant business that has been lost in its giant energytrading op erations The Enron machine continues to sputter Mr Fleischer wrote Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren egotiate the terms significantly Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcyl aw filing Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba nkers and customers an Enron bankruptcycourt filing is highly possible said Ralph Pellecchia a senior director at Fitch a creditratings agency On Wednesday Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not ch above noninvestmentgrade or junk status But Fitch also said it bel ieved Enrons trading partners had made significant cash collateral calls in recent days that are well in excess of previous expectations contrib uting to liquidity pressures Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir m of Weil Gotshal Manges which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate workout situations Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing an Enron spok eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor e doesnt expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger Since the m erger announcement Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them Enron sa id it made some progress improving its financial position The company said it reached a final agreement with units of JP Morgan Chase Co and Cit igroup Inc on the remaining million of a previously announced bill ion in secured credit lines Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym ent of an existing million note to midDecember from next week The sp okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet ed next month so that repayment wouldnt be required this year Thaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article Options Report Premiums Stay High on Enrons Near Options And Doubling Up Date Looms fo r Tax Losses By Kopin

Enrons December calls traded more than contracts compar ed with open interest of as they fell to at the CBOE For investors who want to book a tax loss on beatendown stocks the wash sale rule can be a hurdle because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring substantially i dentical securities within a day period before or after that loss This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri ces now make them attractive buy candidates In addition the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w ashsale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an inthemoney pu t because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir ed by the investor So investors typically get around the washsale rule by doubling up buyi ng additional stock or options waiting at least days and then selling the original stock to book the loss Investors double up by buying calls w hich locks a price

system run by Platts a unit of publi sher McGrawHill Cos MHP Aware of sensitivity to its role in oil markets from within the industry P latts is approaching electronic trading with a very different business mode l from existing commissionbased sites Platts sources say its new system dubbed PlattsDirect is designed initi ally at least as a communication device to enhance its existing role of assessing and publishing benchmark energy prices Its current telephoneba sed systems they say cant cope with rising liquidity all of which must be factored in when making its price assessments They hope PlattsDirect will develop as a master exchange providing a ne utral base for other exchanges to feed pricing information in order to co mpliment Platts leading role as price benchmark assessor and publisher PlattsDirect is more likely to charge a subscription fee than commissions sources said although a final decision has yet to be made Unlike some oth er systems PlattsDirect will offer no

system which has suffered repeated delays since its o riginal launch date of October Is Nymex Leaving It Too Late Some oil traders suggest Nymex has missed the boat in its efforts to deve lop electronic trading bogged down by its desire to keep local floor trade rs happy In September Nymex President J Robert Collins said the launch of eNymex h ad been delayed by factors including the bankruptcy of one of the systems developers Globalview Software Inc according to industry publications Oi l and Gas Journal and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly But several months later Globalview continues to be alive and well despit e legal action taken against it by Nymex and has posted a increase in sales so far this year A senior Globalview official said his company is co untersuing

Petroleum Exchange which plans to scrap floor trading and a dopt electronic trading for all its products Enron Corps ENE Enron Online faces even more serious problems than Nyme x Oil trading sources say it has seen a sharp reduction in trade volume ov er recent weeks as counterparties grow increasingly wary over the companys financial position The system Enron designed to reduce credit risk wher e Enron itself acts as a counterparty to every online trade appears to ha ve backfired Even if the system is successfully transferred to Dynegy Inc DYN which has agreed to take over Enron pending legal objections trading sources say counterparties are likely to be wary of placing so much risk with a sin gle company again leaving the Enron Online trading model at a disadvantage They added that unless the Dynegy takeover is quick Enron Online liquidity could dry up completely Enron itself has warned that reduced trading acti vity will hit fourthquarter earnings Platts Independence Physical Trade Advantageous While it doesnt appear keen to compete with other systems headon initiall y PlattsDirect has several advantages which could persuade traders to use its system A possible absence of commissions is of concern to Singapore br okers and probably other online sites too Platts sources claim the sites independence and resulting objectivity is a lso a major advantage over other sites But the concern for Platts is that that very independence also means it has no guaranteed support from within the trading community ICE by contrast was developed and is owned by a selection of companies in volved in the trading of oil including oil majors BP PLC BP Total Fina Elf SA TOT and Royal DutchShell Group RD and enjoys IPE support PlattsDirect is also able to offer physical trade unique so far among on line energy trading sites Some traders say Platts existing role as a publ isher of benchmark oil price assessments particularly in Asia is bound to attract trade to the new

your energy needs Revenues were enorm ous Profits nudged billion Its place in the business firmament was sec ured when the Houston Astros quarterbilliondollar retractable roof ballp ark was named Enron Field Now we know that the transformation was more magical than anyone imagined The first clue was the companys announcement that it was restating earning s going back four years plus a few quarters Call it five years Now that j ust might be a record Its never good news when a company says it will be rethinking its profit n umbers They never seem to go up as a result Sure enough in the case of E nron approximately million was erased from the earnings line starting in when the company should have netted million less than it previo usly claimed through to last year in which it should

Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating The stock once tra ded at It closed yesterday at on the New York Stock Exchange This week a former accountant with the SEC pronounced that the Enron disas ter added to the accounting messes that have gone before make for investo r losses to rival the savings and loan fiasco The companys debt rating is barely investment grade and its survival strategy delivering itself to a takeover by the much smaller Dynegy Inc is in jeopardy In a securities filing Monday Enron said that a ratings downgrade will force it to meet a debt obligation of million before months end an obligation that it may not be able to meet Yesterday the company said it had bought some brea thing room on that debt to midDecember Any more ratings events that i s another downgrade will cause the company to repay refinance or cash c ollateralize another billion Short story the companys unravelling Did it have to come to this Judging from the offbalance sheet shenanigans at the company the answer to that question is a clear yes We need only c onsider the moment in when Enrons board endorsed a move by none other than its own chief financial officer to head up a couple of whollyowned s ubsidiaries that would do business with the principal company The results of the subsidiaries would not be consolidated on Enrons balance sheet A s prinkling of insiders constituted the review and approval team that would o versee the transactions Andrew Fastow was the lucky CFO Lucky is an apt description as Enron has now disclosed that Fastow earned more than million from a host of manag ement and investment activities through both the subsidiaries and related p artnerships called JEDI and Chewco Yes they were named in honour of the Star Wars movies Enron always had a reputation for being fast and entrepreneurial Investors just never knew how fast and entrepreneurial the company was Fastow was p ushed out the door three weeks ago The companys treasurer and its general counsel were fired Both had participated in a limited partnership that ha d purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of the Fastow subsidiaries Its as simple as that Some of the Fastow transactions involving investments in power projects fr om Poland to Brazil or call options on gas turbines are as clear as mud O thers are more transparent Example in December Enron sold an

assumed the sellerfinan ced note from Enron When LJM subsequently sold the investment it repaid t he Enron note and pocketed a profit There are plenty of conflict of interest examples Plus numerous losses tha t should have accrued to Enron as a result of the subsidiaries activities losses that the company thought it would rather not recognize Chastened Enron has established a special committee

Cendant Corp Microstrategy Inc Sunbeam Corp and Waste Management Inc saying I think we ought to look at them all Former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner expressed disappointment at the ove rsight boards reluctance to exercise its investigative muscle given a ras h of financial restatements and frauds that have cost investors more than billion in recent years In light of losses that have reached the magnitude of the savingsandloan debacle its time for the POB to start carrying out investigations of wha ts happening at the audit firms Mr Turner said He said Rep Dingell is right to question the accounting professions abili ty to police itself through socalled peer reviews saying recent audit fai lures are evidence that the peerreview process is not as robust as it nee ds to be Firms that audit public companies must undergo peer review every three year s subjecting their work to scrutiny by a competing audit firm or a panel a ppointed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants In prac tice the Big Five firms hire each other to conduct the oversight with no requirement to rotate assignments and critics say reviewers arent as toug h as they could or should be Theres a tendency in the peer reviews even when problems are identified to regard them as isolated instances not evidence of a systemic failure at an audit firm said Douglas Carmichael an accounting professor at Baruc h College in New York Mr Bowsher defends peer reviews as a very rigorous thorough process bu t concedes they havent prevented a recent bout of problematic audits He s uggested that may be due to factors from bad judgment on the part of indivi dual partners to questions about applying accounting and auditing standards In Enrons case the qualitycontrol inquiry committee composed of about a dozen CPAs will investigate Andersens audit work but critics doubt it wi ll do much digging BusinessFinancial Desk Section A Employees Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company The rapid decline of the Enron Corporation has devastated its employees re tirement plan which was heavy with company stock and has infuriated worke rs who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunge d Through the k retirement plan employees chose to put much of their sa vings in Enron shares and the company made contributions in company stock as well But around the time Enron disclosed serious financial problems las t month the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrat ive change For several weeks as the stock lost much of its value workers stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated They were not allowed to switch investments at all even though the plan had far less r isky choices The unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for Enrons workers At the end of last year the k plan had billion in assets More than half wa s invested in Enron an energy conglomerate Since then the stock has lost percent of its value At Portland General Electric the Oregon utility acquired by Enron four yea rs ago some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars The utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work throug h their problems We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as or said Steve Lacey an emergencyrepair dispatcher for Portlan d General It pretty much wiped out every employees savings plan Shortly after it was frozen the articles started coming out about some o f the questionable activities of Enron Mr Lacey added The stock took a tremendous drop and we were pretty much helpless The loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on one investment Stock plunges similar to Enrons have also wiped out the re tirement savings of many employees of the Nortel Networks Corporation Luce nt Technologies Inc and Global Crossing Ltd The loss by Enrons workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits ma de by some senior Enron executives who sold stock during the last few year s Enrons chairman Kenneth L Lay made million during the first se ven months of by exercising stock options and more than millio n by exercising options during the three prior years Last week Mr Lay ag reed to forgo a million severance package after Enron traders and emplo yees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed acquisition of the company by Dynegy Inc while they were suffering Enron which is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissi on investigation of transactions among Enron and partnerships headed by the companys former chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow and a number o f shareholders suits now has an additional legal problem On Tuesday Steve W Berman a lawyer from Seattle who represented states a gainst the tobacco industry filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in H ouston seeking classaction status on behalf of Enron employees who lost mo ney on the stock through their retirement plan The lawsuit says that Enron schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fi duciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests They were promoting Enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching employees contributions with Enron stock when they knew the stock was ov ervalued and thats a breach of their fiduciary duties Mr Berman said in an interview yesterday Whats more he said the assets were frozen on Oct with the stock at even though Enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosur es about the companys accounting practices They knew the worst news was about to come out but they froze the stock he said Enron closed yesterday at The company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pendi ng litigation A spokeswoman Karen Denne said that the change in plan adm inistrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did n ot know the exact date the change was put into effect Like many other big companies Enron made its contributions to the plan in company shares But employees also chose to put much of their own contribut ions into the stock lured by its stellar past performance The company say s that percent of the Enron stock in the plan wound up there because emp loyees chose it and percent was the companys contribution A lot of people believed in the stock so it wasnt just the company matc h said an employee at Enrons headquarters in downtown Houston It was their own money too People are just shellshocked The stocks past performance had lured many workers Last year as the stoc k soared total assets in the k plan rose more than percent About percent of Enrons employees participate in the k plan The company generally matches employee contributions at cents on the d ollar up to percent of their salary with Enron stock which cannot be s old and put into another investment until the employee reaches age But Ms Denne said workers otherwise have a range of options in which to in vest their money Gerry OConnor a senior consultant with the Spectrem Group a consulting f irm based in Chicago said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze asse ts when administrators were switched If you dont you can wind up with misallocated money wrong statements and all kinds of complicating factors he said But a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many specialists in retirement planning Employees are taking a lot of risk b ut they dont think of it as such Mr OConnor said They say You know I work for this company and were doing great In addition to the swoon in their k plans Enron employees have watche d the value of their stock options wither Enron gave a far larger percenta ge of employees options than most companies do but now with the fall in E nron shares nearly all of those options are worthless Enrons tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its wo rkers in Oregon About percent of the employees of Portland Genera l which Enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash are invested in the k plan said Scott Simms a spokesman The losses he added have hit everyone including officers all the way th rough to other staff Its certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and others havent he said It was the same plan for everyone In an interview with The Oregonian in Portland Peggy Y Fowler Portland G enerals chief executive said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincide nce The timing couldnt have been worse she said We refer to our retirement program as a threelegged stool Social Secu rity the company pension and the k Ms Fowler said One of the l egs has been cut off BusinessFinancial Desk Section C Circling the Wagons Around Enron Risks Too Great To Let Trader Just Die By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D ATLAS The New

nron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances executives close to t he two companies said The discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register doubts about the financial stability of Enron the energy trading concern Enrons stock fell another percent even though the company won a three week reprieve from its banks on a million note that would have come du e next Tuesday if Enron had been unable to come up with collateral An executive close to Enron described the loan extension by J P Morgan C hase and Citigroup as a BandAid given the approach of Thanksgiving Pe ople are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermed iate term the executive added The bankers also met with investors including leveraged buyout firms and t wo industrial companies which might inject up to billion into Enron und er arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the comp anys stock the executives said The new investments would be in Enrons Transwestern Pipeline which links natural gas fields in Texas to the California market they said The deals would be structured like Dynegys agreement as part of the merger to infu se billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Ga s pipeline That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merg er falls apart Besides talking with other potential investors J P Morgan Chase and Citi group agreed to terms that have each taking a million equity stake in such a deal the executives said The bankers plan to meet with Enron offic ials on Monday to complete the transactions they added Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman noted that the company had previously sa id it was seeking a further infusion of up to billion in equity We ar e not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to she said Though investors again manhandled the stock of Enron which is down perc ent this year the banks Dynegy and creditrating agencies all sought to p roceed delicately Executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen the crisis of confidence in Enron wiping out the energy trading operations that only months ago made it one of the nations most admired and politica lly influential companies Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating th e merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other en ergy traders An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally Nor he added was Dyn egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed But he indicated that the situation could change Ms Denne the Enron spokeswoman said that she was not aware of any attemp ts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal Dynegy issued a statement saying that its chief executive Chuck Watson was encouraged by the steps Enron had t aken with its bankers Mr Watson said the company was continuing its due d iligence on the deal Dynegys shares which rose as high as in the days after the merger was announced on Nov closed yesterday at down more than perc ent for the second consecutive day Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange cl osing at down That means the premium that Dynegy would be pay ing for Enron has risen to percent Analysts following Enrons debt said that bankers had little choice but to support the company given that most of Enrons bank debt is not secured T hat means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy they would receive no better treatment than the holders of more than billion in Enron bonds and other debt Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure billion in deb t that will come due by the end of If the Dynegy deal closed that would be the best thing for the banks said one analyst following the deb t James B Lee Jr vice chairman of J P Morgan Chase echoed that thought in a statement issued by Enron We believe the interests of

position up to and through its merger w ith Dynegy Along with Citigroup J P Morgan Chase is Enrons lead bank and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink the big creditrat ing agencies continued to step gingerly The agencies have held Enrons de bt rating one step above junk status knowing that downgrading it furth er would force the company to pay or refinance up to billion in debt effectively rendering Enron insolvent One rating agency official said ye sterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market adding that it was patriotic to hold off Still one rating agency Fitch put out a strongly worded commentary yeste rday If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger Enrons credit situation s eems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible wrote Ralph Pel lecchia and Glen Grabelsky the Fitch analysts following Enron Our prese nt BBB rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the

in the nation s energy markets While Enron has been the nations biggest trader of elect ric power and natural gas many other companies including Dynegy make markets in those commodities Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron s financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind de als and limit their exposure to Enron Yet even one of Enrons most stubborn supporters was

Tribune Business News Houston Chronicle Texas Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM On the days it was cold and damp utility lineman Roy Rinard would think ab out the future His hip hurt from arthritis and his lungs hurt from sarcoidosis but Rinar d knew on days like that hed be climbing poles for only four or five more years Thats because the yearold was pumping every dime he could into his k plan at work and getting a dollarfordollar match And the money was p iling up in the years he worked there Earlier this year Rinard had in his k plan Today its wort h about Thats because Rinard is a lineman with Enronowned Portland General Electr ic in Portland Ore In January Enron was trading for Wednesday it closed at a sh are Part of the reason that Rinard lost so much money is that Enron gives its e mployees their k match in company stock That was great when the stock was flying high but as the stock has tanked employee retirement accounts have evaporated Its fairly common for employers to give their k match in their own co mpany stock said Scott Alt assistant vice president of Aon Consulting a human resources consulting firm in Houston Its often cheaper for a company to provide stock because they dont have t o put out the cash said Alt who sets up k plans for companies And giving stock makes the employees shareholders which many executives be lieves breed loyalty They work a little harder when they own the company Alt said And employees like it except of course if the stock plummets At Enron the problem was compounded when many employees including Rinard saw Enrons stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire acco unt into Enron stock Enron executives were talking about how the stock price was poised to climb above a share he recalled It was going to Rinard and a coworker Steve Lacey have filed an Employee Retirement Inco me Security Act or ERISA lawsuit in Houston contending that Enron reckles sly endangered their retirement funds Steve Berman managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock Enron officials didnt emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive especially when things were going downhill said Berman who is hoping to get the suit certified as a classaction case Hes hoping to prove that the k plan executives failed to act responsi bly when they knew about serious business problems Berman is hoping to break some new legal ground with his case Its pattern ed after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their k contributions with com pany stock that later tanked That case is still in litigation Another troubling feature of the Enron k plan was that employees were not allowed to make trades for about a month Unfortunately the lockdown b egan Oct the day after Enron surprised the market that it was taking a billion aftertax thirdquarter charge to get out of bad investments Enron officials who did not return a telephone call for this column have said they had planned the lockdown for several months because it was changi ng plan administrators But that timing was disastrous for Rinard and his coworkers who couldnt s ell their shares between the time it was a share on Oct and when they could begin to trade again at less than a share I just watched it drop horrified Rinard said There wasnt a thing I c ould do about it Like many employees Rinards k retirement fund was the only thing he had And now Rinard is kicking himself for trusting his company too much Before the wheels came off the wagon retirement was a doable thing Rinard said The end was in sight Now after years of climbing poles Im just right back to where I star ted Business Financial Desk Enron Shares Fall Again on Doubts Energy A retreat by bankers or a credit downgrade could

also gained some breathing space from its lenders announcing that a million note payment due Tuesday had been postponed to midDecember I think theyll probably limp through to the merger said analyst Micha el S Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York But its a bad limp There were no major new disclosures to prompt Wednesdays selloff but inv estors seemed to be afraid to hold Enron stock over the Thanksgiving weeken d traders said The stock market is closed today and open Friday for an ab breviated sessiontraditionally the lightest trading day of the year Enron shares plummeted on Tuesday in reaction to a filing Monday with t he Securities and Exchange Commission in which Enron disclosed the mil lion obligation The disclosure was a surprise even to the credit rating ag encies that have been in constant contact with Enron executives since the c ompanys finances began unraveling last month The rating agencies view is critical because under some controversial Enr on deals that have come to light recently a downgrade to junk level would be a trigger event requiring Enron to immediately pay billion to cre ditors the company said in Mondays SEC filing Such an event could instantly bankrupt the company analysts said Enron has been reeling since midOctober when it began disclosing details of deals involving limited partnerships organized by current or former comp any executives The partnerships purpose appears partly to have been to pu mp up Enrons reported profit while concealing large amounts of debt it was incurring The SEC has announced that it is investigating the situation In addition to announcing the delayed payment Enron said Wednesday that it had tapped the remaining million of a previously announced billion credit line from its chief lenders JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc Enron probably can restructure its debts and postpone most payments until M ay analyst Ronald M Barone of Standard Poors rating agency said Wednes day It is in the lenders interest to cooperate as much of Enrons debt i s unsecured by hard assets and the banks would stand to lose most of their principal in a bankruptcy he said Dynegy broke its recent silence Wednesday by

possible Fitch said If the merger falls through Dynegy still will retain the right to purchase Enrons Northern Natural Gas Co pipeline system for billion However analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank

ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO Andrew S Fastow Enron said Fastow

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Bulls Look To Recovery As Techs Lead The Surge By Andrew Barry In what undoubtedly will become a businessschool case study Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a fullblown financial crisis last week Enrons stock plunged to following a point drop in the prior week and the companys bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around By weeks end Enron had drawn down billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly billion in maturing commercial paper leaving it only about billion of net liquidity Enrons big energy trading operation which accounts for the bulk of the companys profits and most of its equity valuation now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies but the company is likely to remain an investmentgrade credit Moodys Investors Service now rates its debt Baa three notches above junk One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades concerned about Enrons viability push for settlement of the trades precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed LongTerm Capital Management in Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation Enron has resisted refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enroncreated partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly billion loss on that deal Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the companys credit ratings There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets including its moneylosing broadband business Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its secondquarter book value of a share but its worth noting that tangible book excluding goodwill was only a share Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enrons billion asset writedown and its stillmysterious billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships The thirdquarter book value wont be known until Enron releases its balance sheet which may not occur until its quarterly Q is released The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didnt demand it The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the companys leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts confidence in management The Street really didnt provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a billion valuation That value has since shrunk to billion Enrons woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets Until last week Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enrons financial health Enron had about billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed offbalancesheet debt Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years Judging from the companys rather meager credit lines Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets City

continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the companys earnings announcement earlier this month The stock is down more than percent in two weeks and the company lost almost billion in market value Late this week the company decided to convert billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash The company put about billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of shortterm corporate IOU known as commercial paper Nothing spells confidence quite like cash which is what we want investors to understand said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the billion banked this week Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as good management decisions Enrons most recent woes began Oct when its thirdquarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about ThenChief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow with the Enron boards approval had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest The partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the companys newer businesses such as broadband trading Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in shareholder equity new questions began to arise Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected but The Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence In drawing down the billion line of revolving credit this week the company put about billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer and often with more flexible terms Investors in commercial paper who are actually more like lenders since its actually a form of debt are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of shortterm investments The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit To some extent redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets which look at it negatively said Anatol Feygin an analyst with JP Morgan But reducing the companys debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools like a revolving line of credit could give great peace of mind to Enrons investors he said It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business which is really the core of their operations Feygin said Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities still sees the move as somewhat confusing Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange mixed message she said Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back Is it a gesture for customers It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management Jeff Dietert an analyst at Simmons Co said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned In a worstcase scenario investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron That could lead to lower credit ratings which would force Enrons energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it Thus we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues Dietert wrote in a report Friday Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store For example a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco It was formed in with about million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets Chewco was run by Michael Kopper a managing director of Enrons Global Equity Markets Group Frankly that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity Feygin said Until now

Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK Jan Reuters In a move that escalates the California power crisis embattled California utility Southern California Edison said on Tuesday it has suspended at least million of payments to creditors moving it closer to a possible bankruptcy filing SoCal Edison and No rival Pacific Gas and Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp have run up billions of dollars of debt this year because they are subject to a rate freeze and have been unable to pass on their skyrocketing wholesale power costs to consumers In mirror filings on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission the states No utility and its parent Rosemead Califbased Edison International said that to conserve cash SoCal Edison has temporarily suspended three payments due Tuesday These payments include million of principal and interest on its percent notes million to the California Power Exchange and million to qualifying facilities as well as certain other obligations Failure to make the note payment puts SoCal Edison in default on the notes and on other of SoCal Edisons and Edison Internationals credit facilities the filings said The Power Exchange which arranges sales of power to the utilities can foreclose on collateral the utility pledged they said SoCal Edison said it had nearly billion of cash on hand as of Monday and will run out of cash on Feb assuming it makes all payments when due Its an extremely negative sign and telegraphs the companys intention to take this to the mat said Shawn Burke head of US investmentgrade research at Barclays Capital Unless the legislature pulls a bill out of its hat giving them virtually all of what they want its pretty much over Edison International also said in the filings that it plans to amend the articles of incorporation and bylaws for Edison Mission Energy a whollyowned unit to protect its low investmentgrade ratings Edison International shares traded Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at down or percent PGE shares fell or percent on the Big Board to On Jan the California Public Utilities Commission recommended giving the utilities a temporary percent rate hike The utilities rating agencies and many analysts consider such a hike inadequate Edison International has suspended its dividend and SoCal Edison plans to slash up to jobs DOWNGRADES LIKELY The missed payments effectively ensure that credit rating agencies Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service will cut at least some of SoCal Edisons credit and debt ratings to junk status When a company misses a debt payment SP ordinarily does not wait for a grace period if any to run before cutting its rating for that debt to D or default A downgrade to below investmentgrade status would put SoCal Edison in default of some of its credit lines and bank loans and ratchet up its liquidity crunch Its difficult to lend if there is no shortterm solution much less a longterm one said Burke The utility as well as Pacific GE have been shut out of the shortterm debt capital markets and have already drawn on backup credit lines SP now rates most of SoCal Edisons senior longand shortterm debt BBBminus and A its lowest investment grades Moodys rates the respective debt a roughly equivalent Baa and Prime The utilities debt trades like junk A third rating agency Fitch has already cut SoCal Edisons and Edison Internationals ratings deeply into junk The bank loans and credit lines contain no default provisions triggered by that downgrade analysts said DELAYING REPORTING RESULTS Separately SoCal Edison and Edison International said they plan to postpone release of their fourth quarter and yearend fiscal results pending further developments Analysts said SoCal Edison is acting now to push California legislators and regulators to craft a remedy fast This is a rugged step toward moving this process along and forcing California to do something said Jerry Bellucci senior vice president for Applied

English News Service C Reuters Limited SAN FRANCISCO Jan Reuters California in the grips of its worstever power crisis on Tuesday declared a Stage Three power emergency the highestlevel alert citing a severe shortage of power and natural gas needed to generate electricity A spokesman for the California Independent Operator System ISO the agency that oversees the operation of most of the states power grid said it did not appear likely they would have to trigger rolling blackouts to relieve the heavy load on the system although the possibility exists whenever a Stage Three alert is called The ISO spokesman said megawatts of generation were off line in California for repairs or maintenance Schools and offices reopened after the Martin Luther King Day US holiday on Monday pushing up demand One megawatt powers about homes The spokesman said there was also a shortage of natural gas available in southern California forcing power plants there to switch to oil to run their generators About onethird of all California power is produced at gasfired plants California has declared a statewide Stage Three alert only twice before but each time narrowly averted rolling blackouts as emergency supplies were made available from neighboring states Only of Californians Feel That There Is an Energy Crisis PR Newswire Copyright c PR Newswire Knowledge Networks Unique Poll Finds Majority Expect Even More Increases From the CPUC MENLO PARK Calif Jan PRNewswire The energy crisis which is dominating media coverage paralyzing state government and prompting industry to consider moving operations elsewhere is causing less concern among average California citizens Results from a recent survey conducted by Knowledge Networks using its unique population projectable Webenabled panel show that just think the current situation is a crisis dont believe that there is a crisis and dont know However California citizens are losing confidence in the system that controls electric power in the state believe the CPUC will extend the recent temporary rate increase given to PGE and Southern California Edison beyond the day limit expect an additional rate increase once the day period is over are positive about electricity deregulation support reconsidering deregulation In addition to attitudes about changing deregulation Californians were surveyed about an extensive range of proposals for dealing with the energy situation People were asked the questions in the same manner as the various proposals have been summarized in the media reports This may account for the high support received on a couple of the proposals For example of the respondents approved the Governors suggestion to add new power generation plants within California and make existing plants more efficient The proposal as worded doesnt distinguish between adding new plants or making existing plants more efficient or some combination thereof Critics note that in the past Californians have been hesitant about power plants being built in their own communities Among the other proposals Californians are most supportive of Federal limits on the amount that electricity suppliers can charge for wholesale energy sold to California utilities Incentives for reducing electricity usage by Creating a state power authority to take over existing plants and speed up the building of new power plants Attitudes towards the two largest investor owned utilities PGE and Southern California Edison are noticeably split find the explanations about the crisis given by the utilities to be believable while an equal percentage dont believe them With regards to the possibility of going bankrupt think that it is somewhat likely that the two utilities will be forced to declare bankruptcy if they dont receive outside help think that the state and or Federal government should help prevent bankruptcy While just over half think that the electricity situation is a crisis there are clear signs that people take the situation seriously When asked about actions they have taken to reduce their electricity usage a majority report taking basic steps like shutting off lights reducing the temperature and cutting back on holiday lighting Looking forward Californians will be replacing less efficient lighting and taking other steps to make their homes more efficient state that they will likely switch to another electricity

California Edison a subsidiary of Edison International EIX said it will be out of cash on Feb based on its current cash flow forecast according to a Form K filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission Southern California Edison had cash reserves of about billion according to the filing AM Southern California Edison said it estimates it has a million payment due to the California Power Exchange Tuesday million in payments to qualifying facilities due through Jan a scheduled interest payment of million on maturing notes due Tuesday and million pyaments for commercial paper due through Jan The company also has total expenses for energy delivered as of Monday but not yet paid for of billion However Southern California Edison states that due to a significant lag time between the delivery of energy and the final billing the actual expenses through Monday cant be determined at this time Southern California Edison said that in an attempt to conserve cash it has temporarily suspended payment of million of principal and interest on its notes due Jan million due to the California Power Exchange due Jan million due to certain qualifying facilities as well as certain other unnamed obligations As reported a company representative told Dow Jones Newswires Monday that the company might not be able to make the payment to bondholders According to the company failure to pay the notes when due constitutes a default allowing the noteholders to exercise remedies available to them Failure to make the payment on the notes also constitutes a default under Southern California Edisons credit facilities entitling the lenders to exercise certain remedies If the company doesnt cure or waive the defaults within a specified time period the defaults may trigger defaults on all outstanding series of the companys senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures Failure to make the payment to the California Power Exchange constitutes a default under the agreement allowing the exchange to foreclose on collateral pledged by the company According to the filing Southern California Edison is attempting to avoid bankruptcy and intends to pay all of its obligations once a solution to the current liquidity crisis has been reached However the company warns that its possible that it could be forced into bankruptcy Based on the ongoing uncertainties Southern California Edison and Edison International intend to postpone releasing their financial results for the fourth quarter and yearend pending further developments in federal and state regulatory proceedings judicial proceedings legislative enactments and other efforts to resolve the current energy crisis notes the filing Southern California Edison said in the filing that as of Dec the difference between the cost of supplying electricity to customers and the amounts received from customers reached billion and is continuing to increase As reported because of liquidity and other problems the company has no unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities and its been unable to arrange any additional facilities In addition the company is unable to issue commercial paper or access the capital markets on reasonable terms On Jan the California Public Utilities Commission authorized a surcharge for days in an attempt to help Southern California Edison as well as PGE Corp PCG which is also undergoing severe liquidity problems Southern California Edison said the rate increase provides no real relief and will increase revenue by about million a month during the three months the surcharge is in effect Edison International is an energy holding company Southern California Edison provides electricity to people in California Todd Goren Fed FilingsDow Jones Calif Gov Could Stymie Solution To Crisis FERCs Hebert Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday By Bryan Lee Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Highlevel talks over the weekend on a plan to rescue Californias troubled two largest utilities and keep power flowing to customers have brought participants no closer to a solution sources involved in the discussions said Monday And as events Tuesday are expected to push the states financially ailing electric utilities closer to bankruptcy responsibility for the potential meltdown rests squarely with California Gov Gray Davis a key federal energy regulator said Monday Youve got a governor who cares more about being on a nighttime news show than he does about fixing the problem in California said Curtis Hebert a Republican on the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hebert criticized Davis a Democrat for his refusal to swallow the bitter financial medicine needed to rescue the states flawed power market restructuring initiative Heberts comments echo those voiced privately by industry officials and Clinton Administration officials involved in unprecedented discussions brokered by the White House since Tuesday The talks are designed to reach agreement on a plan that will allow the states utilities to continue purchasing power for their retail customers despite a liquidity crunch brought about by the states power market restructuring effort Broadly the proposed deal involves having Californias Department of Water Resources enter into longterm power sales contracts on behalf of the utilities This would end the utilities reliance on volatile spot markets for power purchases In return power generators are to grant some form of forbearance for the money they are owed while the forward contracts are ironed out But throughout seven days of negotiations Davis has refused to consider raising stateprotected retail rates and has resisted calls for the state to issue credit guarantees for the utilities In the meantime Davis has insisted that power suppliers agree to sell the state power under longterm contracts at rates generators say is below their cost of production Unless Davis backs down no rescue package can be struck some people close to the negotiations say Everybodys still trying to talk but now its spinning out of control said a person involved in the discussions A person representing power marketers and familiar with the status of the talks I dont see any great cause for optimism particularly when I hear some of the things that Daviss office says Governors Office Rejects Talk Of No Progress A spokesman for the governor rejected the characterization that the talks were stymied People are working and moving forward said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman If they werent closer to an agreement they wouldnt still be talking To send a message to the markets that theres not progress here is irresponsible Draft legislation to be unveiled Tuesday at the state Legislature will hold up the governors end of the deal Maviglio said The legislation will give the state the authority to purchase power on behalf of the utilities and the structure of the longterm contracts will give the utilities the ability to pay down the billions in uncollected power costs they have accumulated to date he said The utilities Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison Co and PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co say they have no cash on hand and have been squeezed out of capital markets after hemorrhaging some billion buying highcost wholesale electricity and selling it for a considerable loss under statemandated frozen retail rates Southern California Edison has a multimilliondollar bill due Tuesday for power purchases made in November and no cash on hand Pacific Gas Electric says it can squeak by until early February but obtained approval from federal regulators on Friday for a corporate restructuring that will help shelter its successful unregulated business units should the utility unit files for bankruptcy Developments could come fast and furious if financial markets open Tuesday with no deal struck Wall Street credit ratings agencies have warned they will downgrade the utilities debt to speculative or junkbond status if a solution isnt reached soon And various entities are expected to file emergency petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that power keeps flowing to the state despite the utilities inability to purchase power for their retail customers According to sources familiar with the discussions one filing would allow the Department of Water Resources to purchase wholesale power on behalf of the utilities while another would give Southern California Edison more time to make good on amounts owed power suppliers Whether the regulatory filings buy the utilities time to avoid bankruptcy remains to be seen Theyve got to make some real decisions here FERCs Hebert said of the stymied negotiations with Davis If Davis is not willing to make those decisions then certainly I think hes to blame By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Houston

bankruptcy proceedings State and federal lawmakers are trying to craft a temporary solution to Californias power crisis Officials met this past weekend with electricity wholesalers to negotiate a plan by California Gov Gray Davis for the state to buy electricity and sell it to utilities That plan was to be introduced Tuesday in the Legislature The state believes it can negotiate better prices than the utilities which have seen their credit ratings plummet in recent months PGE and SoCal Edison say they have lost more than dlrs billion because of wholesale price increases and the states deregulation law that froze rate hikes Electricity sellers have been increasingly reluctant to supply California because of the utilities dwindling finances Edison owes a major payment Tuesday to the Power Exchange which manages the wholesale buying and selling of electricity Power industry sources estimate the bill to be more than dlrs million but believe the company has the resources to make the payment Technically SoCal Edison will not be in default on the payment until Thursday Company officials refused to comment on their obligations to the Power Exchange They said they would disclose details Tuesday in a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission PGE officials said Monday that they would pay their dlrs million bill due this week The utility has approximately dlrs

supply million homes California Utilitys Power Supply Could Be Cut By John R Emshwiller and Mitchel Benson Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Today could prove to be a critical day in Californias electricity crisis as one of the states biggest utilities Southern California Edison Co faces a possible cutoff from power supplies Edison a unit of Edison International Inc is considering not paying a big wholesale electricpower bill believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars that comes due today from the California Power Exchange a person familiar with the matter said Edison is suffering from a cash shortage brought on by the skyrocketing cost of wholesale power An Edison spokesman declined to comment yesterday A spokesman for the Power Exchange said Edison could face immediate cutoff from further purchases via the exchange if it doesnt pay its bill However the exchange was talking with various parties in an effort to avoid such a suspension We are still in negotiations We dont know what we have yet the spokesman said The Power Exchange created as part of Californias utilityderegulation effort serves as a crucial middleman between utilities and power generators Under deregulation Edison obtains much of its daily electricity through the exchange An inability to buy through that venue could leave Edison and its million customers in Southern California facing power shortages and possible blackouts Adding to the financial uncertainty surrounding Edison Dow Jones Newswires citing a senior Edison executive reported late yesterday that the company has a million bond payment due today that it also might be unable to pay Meanwhile state officials met through the Martin Luther King Jr holiday in Sacramento in a frantic effort to resolve the power crisis Within the next to hours Wall Street and the energy producers need a precondition a signal that were serious and heading in a direction theyre comfortable with said one lawmaker involved in the talks One idea proposed by Gov Gray Davis and others is to have the state use its financial resources to purchase power from electricity producers for resale to the financially beleaguered utilities We dont have to go into business tomorrow as the purchaser the lawmaker said We simply have to make a strong enough and substantive enough statement coming out of the state capitol so that the creditors and energy producers will exercise forbearance Such forbearance would give utilities more time to pay billions of dollars of wholesale power costs that they have accrued but havent been able to collect from customers through rates Several people involved in yesterdays talks said they were optimistic that some plan would be ready to present to a legislative committee today for public hearings and potentially a vote in the Assembly They acknowledged that as of late yesterday that no agreements had been reached with electricity producers on such crucial issues as the price to be charged for the electricity and the length of the supply contracts Californias Legislature has been called into special session by Gov Davis to consider a series of bills aimed both at improving the states electricity supply and at curtailing demand Edisons move on its Power Exchange bill could compress the timeframe for action Many observers believed the utilities had sufficient cash to see them through early February when another round of big wholesale electric bills comes due Last weekend the Pacific Gas Electric utility unit of PGE Corp reiterated its belief that it has sufficient cash to pay its expenses until early February In recent weeks Edison and PGE have said they are being pushed to the brink of insolvency and bankruptcylaw filings because of skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs Some observers speculate that if Edison doesnt pay its Power Exchange bill it could be a signal that the utility is moving closer to a bankruptcylaw filing Richard Cortright Jr a Standard Poors director said an analysis by the creditratings concern indicates that Edison has enough cash to pay the Power Exchange Preserving cash by not paying bills is often a tactic a company uses before bankruptcy Mr Cortright said SP and other ratings concerns have been closely following the California electricity crisis because of the impact it could have on billions of dollars of utility bonds outstanding The ratings concerns have severely downgraded both Edison and PGE bonds The agencies generally havent dropped those bonds into junk bond status which is below investment grade Such a downgrade would put the utilities into various financial defaults that could exacerbate their acute cash problems While the California situation is incredibly fluid any failure by Edison to pay its power bills paints a very very dire picture Mr Cortright said To better understand the current picture state legislative leaders have recruited several legal and financial advisers Among them is David Wiggs managing director of Lido Capital in Newport Beach Calif a financial adviser to the utility and telecommunications industries Mr Wiggs who has been hired to advise the newly created Assembly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability is a retired chairman of the utility El Paso Electric Co Mr Wiggs in turn has hired to assist him Robert D Albergotti and Stacey Cowand Jernigan members of the Dallas law firm of Haynes Boone Two investment advisers from New York investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston Corp are advising legislators on a pro bono basis As regulators politicians and executives struggled to come up with fixes California itself struggled through another day of tight power supplies Metro Desk Power Firm Demands Utilities Pay Bills Now Electricity Supplier says it will haul Edison and PGE into bankruptcy court if money isnt forthcoming Lawmakers scramble for a solution NANCY VOGEL MIGUEL BUSTILLO TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Increasing the pressure on state lawmakers to craft at least a temporary solution to Californias power crisis a major power supplier threatened Monday to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric into bankruptcy court unless the utilities pay their bills due this week The move by Dynegy Inc of Houston upped the ante on a day when legislators huddled with financial experts and lawyers but reached no agreement on a mechanism for the state to buy electricity for Edison and PGE at rates far lower than they pay nowallowing the beleaguered utilities breathing room to restructure their massive debts If we cant get this bill through in the next two days this will start to unravel said Stephen W Bergstrom president of Dynegy When and if they Edison default on Thursday it puts us in a position where we have to take them into bankruptcy and Im sure others will be right beside us Bergstrom refused to say how much money Dynegy is owed but said if any three creditors jointly petitioned the court it would be enough to start involuntary bankruptcy proceedings Under a plan outlined this weekend by Gov Gray Davis after marathon bicoastal negotiations the state would use its excellent credit rating to purchase electricity and then resell it to debthobbled utilities The state Department of Water Resources has stepped in on an emergency basis to buy power to prevent blackouts but Davis plan would overnight make California the biggest single buyer of electricity in its own market Legislators generally backed the need for the state to buy power but there has been no agreement on two key issues the price and the duration of the contracts The price needs to be low enough so that utilities with the rates currently in place can save enough to restructure their debtsbut high enough so that the power producers will go along with the plan With attention focused on how Wall Street will view the tenuous agreement when markets reopen after the weekend legislators were fighting multiple deadlines in trying to make good on the weekend promise to pass a bill by today Edison owes a major payment today to the Power Exchange the market created in under deregulation Power industry sources say they believe Edison has the cash to make the payment estimated at more than million but that the firm could play highstakes political poker by delaying payment to increase pressure on lawmakers Technically Edison will not be in default on the payment until Thursday Edison officials refused to comment on the negotiations with state leaders or the firms obligations to the Power Exchange They said they would disclose details today in a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission PGE officials said Monday that they would pay their million bill due this week The utility has approximately million in cash a spokesman said with a bill for about million due Feb Electricity sellers have been increasingly reluctant to supply California because of the deteriorating financial condition of the utilities The volume of electricity traded in the Power Exchange has dropped by roughly in the last month Grid operators have struggled daily to buy enough power to balance flow on highvoltage wires and prevent blackouts On Monday a holiday during which many offices and businesses were closed the states power reserves shrank to nearly Legislators convened in an emergency session on the states energy crisis quickly seized on Davis idea Were working here around the clock doing everything we can said Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks during an afternoon break in talks among a halfdozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers Also involved were the states finance director a bankruptcy lawyer and two utility experts from Credit Suisse First Boston Their purpose was to craft a skeleton of the legislation that California will need to implement Davis proposal and have it passed by at least one house of the Legislature today Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco has said that while the Legislature works power generators should be willing to give utilities leeway on bills coming due But thats unlikely unless the Legislature acts quickly said Bergstrom of Dynegy His company purchased three Southern California power plants when Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric auctioned off assets as part of deregulation Dynegys plants can generate enough electricity to supply million homes Were just not going to do that Bergstrom said because the stakes are too high He met with Davis and California lawmakers in Washington DC last Tuesday evening and spoke to them again through a bicoastal video conference Saturday The governor has been lobbying power plant owners to sign longterm contracts with the utilities at roughly cents per kilowatthourwell below the recent market rate of cents Power plant owners call that price unrealistic unless the contract lasts at least six or seven years allowing them to recoup money later when the cost of natural gas is expected to fall and make electricity cheaper to generate Contract details do not matter Bergstrom said so long as the utilities are so debtridden as to be unworthy of credit Thats why the state needs to step in to buy power and guarantee payment he said But some lawmakers have downplayed the urgency Burton has said it is more important to get the details of a bill right than to move quickly To insert the state as a gobetween in Californias electricity market raises many complex financial and political issues Even lawmakers who support helping the utilities insist that consumers get something in return Stock options ownership of utility transmission lines or takeover of hydroelectric power plantsa cheap source of power that affects the environmental health of many Sierra Nevada riversare among the assets the state should consider Burton said Hertzberg spokesman Paul Hefner said lawmakers have included bankruptcy lawyers and financial experts not solely to impress Wall Street but also because they realize they are entering a realm they know little about He said politicians clearly want to send a message to financial markets that they are working with industry experts when considering the consequences of their legislation But he said their main goal is to get technical advice from someone who is not a bureaucrat and is not employed by a power firm Metro Desk Court May Decide if Power Users Pay More Court Edison calls ruling that it can pass on costs a victory The PUC says its just the first of many steps in the battle over setting rates HENRY WEINSTEIN TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company A federal judges recent ruling that Southern California Edison Co has the right to pass on to consumers its costs of acquiring power on the wholesale market does not mean that ratepayers will have to bear any of those costs soon But the decision nonetheless provided immediate benefits to the beleaguered utilityprimarily making the company look more financially secure and creditworthy because the ruling could pave the way for a recovery of more than billion for Edison Consequently attorneys and spokesmen for Edison trumpeted the ruling of US District Judge Ronald SW Lew as a significant victory Attorneys for the California Public Utilities Commission played down the decisions consequences saying it was merely the first skirmish in a long process Regardless of how significant Lews ruling was the legal battle clearly has important ramifications and they go beyond Edisons financial health Ultimately the case titled Southern California Edison vs Loretta M Lynch president of the PUC may determine whether Edisons customers have to pay more for electricity Moreover the caseand a virtually identical one filed by Pacific Gas Electric Co in Oakland federal courtmay clarify whether there will be any change in the traditional demarcation of regulatory authority over utilities as a result of deregulation Historically the federal government has regulated wholesale power rates and state governments have regulated retail rates those charged to consumers One of the key issues in the Edison and PGE cases is the utilities contention that a PUCimposed rate freeze violated the traditional demarcation by indirectly interfering with federal regulatory authority Both companies say that they have been prevented from recovering their wholesale purchase costs because of the rate freeze imposed by the PUC as part of the massive utility deregulation law enacted in known as AB Unless the issues are resolved by legislative action on the state energy crisis it seems likely that the two suits will wind up in the US th Circuit Court of Appeals and perhaps ultimately the US Supreme Court The California Public Utilities Commission and the Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group are opposing the companies in court The deregulation law provides that the California rate freeze lasts until March or until what are known as a utilitys stranded costs in essence certain assets such as nuclear power plants that were overvalued in are recovered The PUC determined last year that San Diego Gas Electric the states other major privately owned utility had recovered its stranded costs enabling that company to impose rate hikes But the agency has said that Edison and PGE are not entitled to take such action yet On Jan Judge Lew agreed in principle with Edisons contention that the Federal Power Act trumps Californias energy deregulation law Lew rejected the PUCs argument that he should dismiss the case because retail rates are exclusively a matter of state regulation The judge also rejected the agencys alternative request that he defer a decision for at least days while the PUC gathered more facts The judge said the gravity of the situation required immediate action PUC actions are having devastating effects on Edisons current ability to obtain financing to enable it to continue to procure wholesale power at current prices Lew said In essence Lew agreed with Edisons lawyers Ronald L Olson and John W Spiegel that the company is caught in a vise that threatens to squeeze it out of existence On the one side SCE has been forced to pay astronomically high prices to buy wholesale electricity the lawyers said in a brief filed in Lews court The statute requires SCE to procure all of the electricity needed to serve its million retail customers from two wholesale market institutions whose pricing practices are exclusively within the Federal Regulatory Commissions jurisdiction Since last June the cost of procuring electricity through these market institutions has increased nearly fourfold the attorneys said On the other side SCE has been unable to recover these expenses through retail rates which are currently frozen under California law In addition Edisons lawyers maintain that the PUC has interpreted California law to prohibit SCE from recovering these costs either now or in the future Consequently Edison has had to buy high and sell low leaving it with a shortfall in excess of billion the company says The PUC counters that a substantial portion of Edisons costs are paid to itself from power the company buys from its own plants and that Edison has reaped additional billions in the last two years from the sale of certain assets The agency contends that those funds should be available to offset the financial problems the company is complaining about The PUC also contends that Edison failed to take other steps that could have lowered its costs in acquiring power In addition to the dispute over the facts there has been a clash over Edison s contention that Californias rate freeze interferes with federal regulation of the wholesale energy market The PUC and the Utility Reform Network counter that the freeze is an essential component of the Federal Regulatory Commissions approval of wholesale sales The regulatory commission has taken no formal position on the pending litigation However Douglas W Smith the agencys general counsel sent a letter to Edison attorney Spiegel saying that the filed rate doctrine applies in a situation such as this The doctrine according to a US Supreme Court decision holds that interstate power rates filed with the Federal Regulatory Commission or set by it must be given binding effect by state utility commissions determining intrastate rates However Michael Strumwasser attorney for the consumers group said the Supreme Court decision arose in an entirely different context He said the specific question now at issuewhether the filed rate doctrine applies when wholesale rates have been set by market forces rather than a regulatory proceedinghas never been ruled on by an appellate court Lew made no explicit rulings on the PUC allegations that Edison should have offset wholesale payment costs through other revenues However Lew said the PUC is entitled to present evidence about the prudence of Edisons wholesale electricity purchases Further hearings on that issue could determine how much of its costs Edison is entitled to recover The PUC contends that Edison could have made some purchases at lower prices than it did But Edison attorneys counter that this is a disingenuous argument because the PUC has not objected to the prudence of Edisons purchases Indeed the Edison lawyers say the next phase of the case should be very brief because the PUC in effect consented to Edisons prior actions Attorneys for the PUC and the consumers group disagree sharply saying a bevy of issues need to be reviewed in detail There is no timetable for further proceedings in the Edison case The next hearing on the PGE case is scheduled for Jan in Oakland NEWS Stealthy Deal Protects Profits of PGEs Parents Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright PGE Corp has quietly won approval from federal regulators to restructure itself in a way that shields the parent companys profits and shareholders from the mounting debts of the utility it owns The move appears to allow Pacific Gas and Electric Cos parent to record substantial profits while maintaining that its subsidiary which supplies power to million customers is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and trying to force ratepayers to pick up the tab The corporate restructuring approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday came as a surprise to consumer advocates and state leaders dealing with the energy crisis including Gov Gray Davis They have been working feverishly the past seven days to construct a deal that would alleviate debt pressure on PGE and Southern California Edison by having the state of California buy power and provide it to the utilities at cost Steve Moviglio a spokesman for Davis said the governor was displeased by PGEs move although he said it was not likely to derail the states efforts to intervene in the crisis He also said Davis was disappointed that FERC acted in the middle of the night without notice to all parties Ratepayer advocates and even some state officials have said that any aid to the ailing utilities should be offset by the huge profits that PGE Corp has made during the crisis from electricity generation and trading revenues The money has certainly flowed in the other direction they argue In the past PGE Corp has used revenues from the utility to pay down corporate debt pay stock dividends and buy assets in other states PGE Corps action appears to eliminate that possible means of paying off at least part of the billion in debt incurred since November by its utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co as it bought power at prices higher than it can legally charge customers Its certainly a response to them feeling the threat that the holding companys going to be held responsible for all this said Bob Finkelstein an attorney for The Utility Reform Network an advocacy group Meanwhile Californias energy crisis continued in full force yesterday as the California Independent System Operator issued a Stage Two emergency meaning that demand had reached within percent of the states electric supply prompting requests to certain large users to shut down and conserve power This occurred despite a national holiday Martin Luther King Day on which most businesses were closed and demand was forecast to reach about megawatts a fairly modest number Further conditions appeared as if they were going to worsen imminently Edison said it will be unable to pay bills coming due today and PGE said it has only about million on hand to cover what it owes Bankruptcy filings by both utilities appeared more likely State leaders were still in negotiations yesterday to broker a deal in which Californias Department of Water Resources would step in and buy power on behalf of the utilities who are facing a growing inability to pay for their purchases The talks were reported to be breaking down however because Davis refused to consider raising California rates or backing utility debts with a letter of credit from the state In San Francisco state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton said legislation passed last week by the Assembly will probably make its way to the governors desk by the end of the month One bill would change the makeup of the boards that oversee the states power market and the other would prohibit utilities from selling off their powergenerating assets In the midst of yet another Stage electrical emergency the Democratic leader said I want the people of California to have long stable available energy throughout the rest of our lives But in the short term with the threat of rolling blackouts and urgent requests for power conservation Burton stated the obvious Turn the goddamn lights off he said NO CHALLENGES TO RESTRUCTURING The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved PGEs restructuring plan on a to vote on Friday It was apparently described in a Dec public notice as a stock transfer and thus flew under the radar screens of most observers Details of the plan were first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Monday Greg Pruett a spokesman for PGE Corp said the intent of the plan was merely to allow another unit of the corporate parent National Energy Group to receive its own credit rating that would be weighed independently of the troubled utility But he acknowledged that all or nearly all of PGE Corps assets outside the utility are held by National Energy Group and that the move would reduce the liability for the corporation Although it was unclear whether PGE informed state leaders of its plans Pruett said the notice of the meeting was publicly available and had at least been provided to the Public Utilities Commission In addition to proceeds from the sale of power plants and other revenues that PGE has forwarded on to its corporate parent the utility has reaped windfall profits during the crisis from the generation and sale of electricity and has not applied those profits to its own debt To do so would require an accounting rule change by the California Public Utilities Commission but company officials have maintained that should not be done PGE IN DEBT TO ITSELF Critics say that PGE is its own biggest debtor with money flying out of one pocket and into the other and that nearly half of its debt is owed to itself In the third quarter of the company reported a percent increase in profits with a net income of million while saying it expected California consumers to eventually pick up the tab for its debt ON TAP TODAY Shortage Electricity demand is expected to grow as

million of payments to creditors moving it closer to a possible bankruptcy filing SoCal Edison and No rival Pacific Gas and Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp have run up billions of

Securities and Exchange Commission the states No utility and its parent Rosemead Califbased Edison International said that to conserve cash SoCal Edison has temporarily suspended three payments due Tuesday These payments include million of principal and interest on its percent notes million to the California Power Exchange and million to qualifying facilities as well as certain other obligations Failure to make the note payment puts SoCal Edison in default on the notes and on other of SoCal Edisons and Edison Internationals credit facilities the filings said The Power Exchange which arranges sales of power to the utilities can foreclose on collateral the utility pledged they said SoCal Edison said it had nearly billion of cash on hand as of Monday and will run out of cash on Feb assuming it makes all payments when due Its an extremely negative sign and telegraphs the companys intention to take this to the mat said Shawn Burke head of US investmentgrade research at Barclays Capital Unless the legislature pulls a bill out of its hat giving them virtually all of what they want its pretty much over Edison International also said in the filings that it plans to amend the articles of incorporation and bylaws for Edison Mission Energy a whollyowned unit to protect its low investmentgrade ratings Edison International shares traded Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at down or percent PGE shares fell or percent on the Big Board to On Jan the California Public Utilities Commission recommended giving the utilities a temporary percent rate hike The utilities rating agencies and many analysts consider such a hike inadequate Edison International has suspended its dividend and SoCal Edison plans to slash up to jobs DOWNGRADES LIKELY The missed payments effectively ensure that credit rating agencies Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service will cut at least some of SoCal Edisons credit and debt ratings to junk status When a company misses a debt payment SP ordinarily does not wait for a grace period if any to run before cutting its rating for that debt to D or default A downgrade to below investmentgrade status would put SoCal Edison in default of some of its credit lines and bank loans and ratchet up its liquidity crunch Its difficult to lend if there is no shortterm solution much less a longterm one said Burke The utility as well as Pacific GE have been shut out of the shortterm debt capital markets and have already drawn on backup credit lines SP now rates most of SoCal Edisons senior longand shortterm debt BBBminus and A its lowest

English News Service C Reuters Limited SAN FRANCISCO Jan Reuters California in the grips of its worstever power crisis on Tuesday declared a Stage Three power emergency the highestlevel alert citing a severe shortage of power and natural gas needed to generate electricity A spokesman for the California Independent Operator System ISO the agency that oversees the operation of most of the states power grid said it did not appear likely they would have to trigger rolling blackouts to relieve the heavy load on the system although the possibility exists whenever a Stage Three alert is called The ISO spokesman said megawatts of generation were off line in California for repairs or maintenance Schools and offices reopened after the Martin Luther King Day US holiday on Monday pushing up demand One megawatt powers about homes The spokesman said there was also a shortage of natural gas available in southern California forcing power plants there to switch to oil to run their generators About

supplies were made available from neighboring states Only of Californians Feel That There Is an Energy Crisis PR Newswire Copyright c PR Newswire Knowledge Networks Unique Poll Finds Majority Expect Even More Increases From the CPUC MENLO PARK Calif Jan PRNewswire The energy crisis which is dominating media coverage paralyzing state government and prompting industry to consider moving operations elsewhere is causing less concern among average California citizens Results from a recent survey conducted by Knowledge Networks using its unique population projectable Webenabled panel show that just think the current situation is a crisis dont believe that there is a crisis and dont know However California citizens are losing confidence in the system that controls electric power in the state believe the CPUC will extend the recent temporary rate increase given to PGE and Southern California Edison beyond the day limit expect an additional rate increase once the day period is over are positive about electricity deregulation support reconsidering deregulation In addition to attitudes about changing deregulation Californians were surveyed about an extensive range of proposals for dealing with the energy situation People were asked the questions in the same manner as the various proposals have been summarized in the media reports This may account for the high support received on a couple of the proposals For example of the respondents approved the Governors suggestion to add new power generation plants within California and make existing plants more efficient The proposal as worded doesnt distinguish between adding new plants or making existing plants more efficient or some combination thereof Critics note that in the past Californians have been hesitant about power plants being built in their own communities Among the other proposals Californians are most supportive of Federal limits on the amount that electricity suppliers can charge for wholesale energy sold to California utilities Incentives for reducing electricity usage by Creating a state power authority to take over existing plants and speed up the building of new power plants Attitudes towards the two largest investor owned utilities PGE and Southern California Edison are noticeably split find the explanations about the crisis given by the utilities to be believable while an equal percentage dont believe them With regards to the possibility of going bankrupt think that it is somewhat likely that the two utilities will be forced to declare bankruptcy if they dont receive outside help think that the state and or Federal government should help prevent bankruptcy While just over half think that the electricity situation is a crisis there are clear signs that people take the situation seriously When asked about actions they have taken to reduce their electricity usage a majority report taking basic steps like shutting off lights reducing the temperature and cutting back on holiday lighting Looking forward Californians will be replacing less efficient lighting and taking other steps to make their homes more efficient state that they will likely switch to another electricity

California Edison a subsidiary of Edison International EIX said it will be out of cash on Feb based on its current cash flow forecast according to a Form K filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission Southern California Edison had cash reserves of about billion according to the filing AM Southern California Edison said it estimates it has a million payment due to the California Power Exchange Tuesday million in payments to qualifying facilities due through Jan a scheduled interest payment of million on maturing notes due Tuesday and million pyaments for commercial paper due through Jan The company also has total expenses for energy delivered as of Monday but not yet paid for of billion However Southern California Edison states that due to a significant lag time between the delivery of energy and the final billing the actual expenses through Monday cant be determined at this time Southern California Edison said that in an attempt to conserve cash it has temporarily suspended payment of million of principal and interest on its notes due Jan million due to the California Power Exchange due Jan million due to certain qualifying facilities as well as certain other unnamed obligations As reported a company representative told Dow Jones Newswires Monday that the company might not be able to make the payment to bondholders According to the company failure to pay the notes when due constitutes a default allowing the noteholders to exercise remedies available to them Failure to make the payment on the notes also constitutes a default under Southern California Edisons credit facilities entitling the lenders to exercise certain remedies If the company doesnt cure or waive the defaults within a specified time period the defaults may trigger defaults on all outstanding series of the companys senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures Failure to make the payment to the California Power Exchange constitutes a default under the agreement allowing the exchange to foreclose on collateral pledged by the company According to the filing Southern California Edison is attempting to avoid bankruptcy and intends to pay all of its obligations once a solution to the current liquidity crisis has been reached However the company warns that its possible that it could be forced into bankruptcy Based on the ongoing uncertainties Southern California Edison and Edison International intend to postpone releasing their financial results for the fourth quarter and yearend pending further developments in federal and state regulatory proceedings judicial proceedings legislative enactments and other efforts to resolve the current energy crisis notes the filing Southern California Edison said in the filing that as of Dec the difference between the cost of supplying electricity to customers and the amounts received from customers reached billion and is continuing to increase As reported because of liquidity and other problems the company has no unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities and its been unable to arrange any additional facilities In addition the company is unable to issue commercial paper or access the capital markets on reasonable terms On Jan the California Public Utilities Commission authorized a surcharge for days in an attempt to help Southern California Edison as well as PGE Corp PCG which is also undergoing severe liquidity problems Southern California Edison said the rate increase provides no real relief and will increase revenue by about million a month during the three months the surcharge is in effect Edison International is an energy holding company Southern California Edison provides electricity to people in California Todd Goren Fed FilingsDow Jones Calif Gov Could Stymie Solution To Crisis FERCs Hebert Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday By Bryan Lee Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Highlevel talks over the weekend on a plan to rescue Californias troubled two largest utilities and keep power flowing to customers have brought participants no closer to a solution sources involved in the discussions said Monday And as events Tuesday are expected to push the states financially ailing electric utilities closer to bankruptcy responsibility for the potential meltdown rests squarely with California Gov Gray Davis a key federal energy regulator said Monday Youve got a governor who cares more about being on a nighttime news show than he does about fixing the problem in California said Curtis Hebert a Republican on the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hebert criticized Davis a Democrat for his refusal to swallow the bitter financial medicine needed to rescue the states flawed power market restructuring initiative Heberts comments echo those voiced privately by industry officials and Clinton Administration officials involved in unprecedented discussions brokered by the White House since Tuesday The talks are designed to reach agreement on a plan that will allow the states utilities to continue purchasing power for their retail customers despite a liquidity crunch brought about by the states power market restructuring effort Broadly the proposed deal involves having Californias Department of Water Resources enter into longterm power sales contracts on behalf of the utilities This would end the utilities reliance on volatile spot markets for power purchases In return power generators are to grant some form of forbearance for the money they are owed while the forward contracts are ironed out But throughout seven days of negotiations Davis has refused to consider raising stateprotected retail rates and has resisted calls for the state to issue credit guarantees for the utilities In the meantime Davis has insisted that power suppliers agree to sell the state power under longterm contracts at rates generators say is below their cost of production Unless Davis backs down no rescue package can be struck some people close to the negotiations say Everybodys still trying to talk but now its spinning out of control said a person involved in the discussions A person representing power marketers and familiar with the status of the talks I dont see any great cause for optimism particularly when I hear some of the things that Daviss office says Governors Office Rejects Talk Of No Progress A spokesman for the governor rejected the characterization that the talks were stymied People are working and moving forward said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman If they werent closer to an agreement they wouldnt still be talking To send a message to the markets that theres not progress here is irresponsible Draft legislation to be unveiled Tuesday at the state Legislature will hold up the governors end of the deal Maviglio said The legislation will give the state the authority to purchase power on behalf of the utilities and the structure of the longterm contracts will give the utilities the ability to pay down the billions in uncollected power costs they have accumulated to date he said The utilities Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison Co and PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co say they have no cash on hand and have been squeezed out of capital markets after hemorrhaging some billion buying highcost wholesale electricity and selling it for a considerable loss under statemandated frozen retail rates Southern California Edison has a multimilliondollar bill due Tuesday for power purchases made in November and no cash on hand Pacific Gas Electric says it can squeak by until early February but obtained approval from federal regulators on Friday for a corporate restructuring that will help shelter its successful unregulated business units should the utility unit files for bankruptcy Developments could come fast and furious if financial markets open Tuesday with no deal struck Wall Street credit ratings agencies have warned they will downgrade the utilities debt to speculative or junkbond status if a solution isnt reached soon And various entities are expected to file emergency petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that power keeps flowing to the state despite the utilities inability to purchase power for their retail customers According to sources familiar with the discussions one filing would allow the Department of Water Resources to purchase wholesale power on behalf of the utilities while another would give Southern California Edison more time to make good on amounts owed power suppliers Whether the regulatory filings buy the utilities time to avoid bankruptcy remains to be seen Theyve got to make some real decisions here FERCs Hebert said of the stymied negotiations with Davis If Davis is not willing to make those decisions then certainly I think hes to blame By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Houston power supplier threatens to bankrupt California utilities Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SACRAMENTO California AP In the midst of Californias struggle to obtain more regional power a major electricity supplier is threatening to take the states two largest utility companies to bankruptcy court If Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric do not make payments due this week officials from Houstonbased Dynegy Inc said Monday they will have no choice but to take them to court If we cant get this bill through in the next two days this will start to unravel Stephen W Bergstrom president of Dynegy told the Los Angeles Times When and if they Edison default on Thursday it puts us in a position where we have to take them into bankruptcy and Im sure others will be right beside us Bergstrom refused to say how much money Dynegy is owed but said if any three creditors jointly petitioned the court it would be enough to start involuntary bankruptcy proceedings State and federal lawmakers are trying to craft a temporary solution to Californias power crisis Officials met this past weekend with electricity wholesalers to negotiate a plan by California Gov Gray Davis for the state to buy electricity and sell it to utilities That plan was to be introduced Tuesday in the Legislature The state believes it can negotiate better prices than the utilities which have seen their credit ratings plummet in recent months PGE and SoCal Edison say they have lost more than dlrs billion because of wholesale price increases and the states deregulation law that froze rate hikes Electricity sellers have been increasingly reluctant to supply California because of the utilities dwindling finances Edison owes a major payment Tuesday to the Power Exchange which manages the wholesale buying and selling of electricity Power industry sources estimate the bill to be more than dlrs million but believe the company has the resources to make the payment Technically SoCal Edison will not be in default on the payment until Thursday Company officials refused to comment on their obligations to the Power Exchange They said they would disclose details Tuesday in a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission PGE officials said Monday that they would pay their dlrs million bill due this week The utility has approximately dlrs million in cash a spokesman said with a bill for about dlrs million due Feb On Monday the states power reserves shrank to nearly percent even though many businesses were closed for the holiday Dynegy purchased three Southern California power plants when SoCal Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric auctioned off assets as part of deregulation The companys plants can generate enough electricity to supply million homes California Utilitys Power Supply Could Be Cut By John R Emshwiller and Mitchel Benson Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Today could prove to be a critical day in Californias electricity crisis as one of the states biggest utilities Southern California Edison Co faces a possible cutoff from power supplies Edison a unit of Edison International Inc is considering not paying a big wholesale electricpower bill believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars that comes due today from the California Power Exchange a person familiar with the matter said Edison is suffering from a cash shortage brought on by the skyrocketing cost of wholesale power An Edison spokesman declined to comment yesterday A spokesman for the Power Exchange said Edison could face immediate cutoff from further purchases via the exchange if it doesnt pay its bill However the exchange was talking with various parties in an effort to avoid such a suspension We are still in negotiations We dont know what we have yet the spokesman said The Power Exchange created as part of Californias utilityderegulation effort serves as a crucial middleman between utilities and power generators Under deregulation Edison obtains much of its daily electricity through the exchange An inability to buy through that venue could leave Edison and its million customers in Southern California facing power shortages and possible blackouts Adding to the financial uncertainty surrounding Edison Dow Jones Newswires citing a senior Edison executive reported late yesterday that the company has a million bond payment due today that it also might be unable to pay Meanwhile state officials met through the Martin Luther King Jr holiday in Sacramento in a frantic effort to resolve the power crisis Within the next to hours Wall Street and the energy producers need a precondition a signal that were serious and heading in a direction theyre comfortable with said one lawmaker involved in the talks One idea proposed by Gov Gray Davis and others is to have the state use its financial resources to purchase power from electricity producers for resale to the financially beleaguered utilities We dont have to go into business tomorrow as the purchaser the lawmaker said We simply have to make a strong enough and substantive enough statement coming out of the state capitol so that the creditors and energy producers will exercise forbearance Such forbearance would give utilities more time to pay billions of dollars of wholesale power costs that they have accrued but havent been able to collect from customers through rates Several people involved in yesterdays talks said they were optimistic that some plan would be ready to present to a legislative committee today for public hearings and potentially a vote in the Assembly They acknowledged that as of late yesterday that no agreements had been reached with electricity producers on such crucial issues as the price to be charged for the electricity and the length of the supply contracts Californias Legislature has been called into special session by Gov Davis to consider a series of bills aimed both at improving the states electricity supply and at curtailing demand Edisons move on its Power Exchange bill could compress the timeframe for action Many observers believed the utilities had sufficient cash to see them through early February when another round of big wholesale electric bills comes due Last weekend the Pacific Gas Electric utility unit of PGE Corp reiterated its belief that it has sufficient cash to pay its expenses until early February In recent weeks Edison and PGE have said they are being pushed to the brink of insolvency and bankruptcylaw filings because of skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs Some observers speculate that if Edison doesnt pay its Power Exchange bill it could be a signal that the utility is moving closer to a bankruptcylaw filing Richard Cortright Jr a Standard Poors director said an analysis by the creditratings concern indicates that Edison has enough cash to pay the Power Exchange Preserving cash by not paying bills is often a tactic a company uses before bankruptcy Mr Cortright said SP and other ratings concerns have been closely following the California electricity crisis because of the impact it could have on billions of dollars of utility bonds outstanding The ratings concerns have severely downgraded both Edison and PGE bonds The agencies generally havent dropped those bonds into junk bond status which is below investment grade Such a downgrade would put the utilities into various financial defaults that could exacerbate their acute cash problems While the California situation is incredibly fluid any failure by Edison to pay its power bills paints a very very dire picture Mr Cortright said To better understand the current picture state legislative leaders have recruited several legal and financial advisers Among them is David Wiggs managing director of Lido Capital in Newport Beach Calif a financial adviser to the utility and telecommunications industries Mr Wiggs who has been hired to advise the newly created Assembly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability is a retired chairman of the utility El Paso Electric Co Mr Wiggs in turn has hired to assist him Robert D Albergotti and Stacey Cowand Jernigan members of the Dallas law firm of Haynes Boone Two investment advisers from New York investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston Corp are advising legislators on a pro bono basis As regulators politicians and executives struggled to come up with fixes California itself struggled through another day of tight power supplies Metro Desk Power Firm Demands Utilities Pay Bills Now Electricity Supplier says it will haul Edison and PGE into bankruptcy court if money isnt forthcoming Lawmakers scramble for a solution NANCY VOGEL MIGUEL BUSTILLO TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Increasing the pressure on state lawmakers to craft at least a temporary solution to Californias power crisis a major power supplier threatened Monday to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric into bankruptcy court unless the utilities pay their bills due this week The move by Dynegy Inc of Houston upped the ante on a day when legislators huddled with financial experts and lawyers but reached no agreement on a mechanism for the state to buy electricity for Edison and PGE at rates far lower than they pay nowallowing the beleaguered utilities breathing room to restructure their massive debts If we cant get this bill through in the next two days this will start to unravel said Stephen W Bergstrom president of Dynegy When and if they Edison default on Thursday it puts us in a position where we have to take them into bankruptcy and Im sure others will be right beside us Bergstrom refused to say how much money Dynegy is owed but said if any three creditors jointly petitioned the court it would be enough to start involuntary bankruptcy proceedings Under a plan outlined this weekend by Gov Gray Davis after marathon bicoastal negotiations the state would use its excellent credit rating to purchase electricity and then resell it to debthobbled utilities The state Department of Water Resources has stepped in on an emergency basis to buy power to prevent blackouts but Davis plan would overnight make California the biggest single buyer of electricity in its own market Legislators generally backed the need for the state to buy power but there has been no agreement on two key issues the price and the duration of the contracts The price needs to be low enough so that utilities with the rates currently in place can save enough to restructure their debtsbut high enough so that the power producers will go along with the plan With attention focused on how Wall Street will view the tenuous agreement when markets reopen after the weekend legislators were fighting multiple deadlines in trying to make good on the weekend promise to pass a bill by today Edison owes a major payment today to the Power Exchange the market created in under deregulation Power industry sources say they believe Edison has the cash to make the payment estimated at more than million but that the firm could play highstakes political poker by delaying payment to increase pressure on lawmakers Technically Edison will not be in default on the payment until Thursday Edison officials refused to comment on the negotiations with state leaders or the firms obligations to the Power Exchange They said they would disclose details today in a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission PGE officials said Monday that they would pay their million bill due this week The utility has approximately million in cash a spokesman said with a bill for about million due Feb Electricity sellers have been increasingly reluctant to supply California because of the deteriorating financial condition of the utilities The volume of electricity traded in the Power Exchange has dropped by roughly in the last month Grid operators have struggled daily to buy enough power to balance flow on highvoltage wires and prevent blackouts On Monday a holiday during which many offices and businesses were closed the states power reserves shrank to nearly Legislators convened in an emergency session on the states energy crisis quickly seized on Davis idea Were working here around the clock doing everything we can said Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks during an afternoon break in talks among a halfdozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers Also involved were the states finance director a bankruptcy lawyer and two utility experts from Credit Suisse First Boston Their purpose was to craft a skeleton of the legislation that California will need to implement Davis proposal and have it passed by at least one house of the Legislature today Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco has said that while the Legislature works power generators should be willing to give utilities leeway on bills coming due But thats unlikely unless the Legislature acts quickly said Bergstrom of Dynegy His company purchased three Southern California power plants when Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric auctioned off assets as part of deregulation Dynegys plants can generate enough electricity to supply million homes Were just not going to do that Bergstrom said because the stakes are too high He met with Davis and California lawmakers in Washington DC last Tuesday evening and spoke to them again through a bicoastal video conference Saturday The governor has been lobbying power plant owners to sign longterm contracts with the utilities at roughly cents per kilowatthourwell below the recent market rate of cents Power plant owners call that price unrealistic unless the contract lasts at least six or seven years allowing them to recoup money later when the cost of natural gas is expected to fall and make electricity cheaper to generate Contract details do not matter Bergstrom said so long as the utilities are so debtridden as to be unworthy of credit Thats why the state needs to step in to buy power and guarantee payment he said But some lawmakers have downplayed the urgency Burton has said it is more important to get the details of a bill right than to move quickly To insert the state as a gobetween in Californias electricity market raises many complex financial and political issues Even lawmakers who support helping the utilities insist that consumers get something in return Stock options ownership of utility transmission lines or takeover of hydroelectric power plantsa cheap source of power that affects the environmental health of many Sierra Nevada riversare among the assets the state should consider Burton said Hertzberg spokesman Paul Hefner said lawmakers have included bankruptcy lawyers and financial experts not solely to impress Wall Street but also because they realize they are entering a realm they know little about He said politicians clearly want to send a message to financial markets that they are working with industry experts when considering the consequences of their legislation But he said their main goal is to get technical advice from someone who is not a bureaucrat and is not employed by a power firm Metro Desk Court May Decide if Power Users Pay More Court Edison calls ruling that it can pass on costs a victory The PUC says its just the first of many steps in the battle over setting rates HENRY WEINSTEIN TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company A federal judges recent ruling that Southern California Edison Co has the right to pass on to consumers its costs of acquiring power on the wholesale market does not mean that ratepayers will have to bear any of those costs soon But the decision nonetheless provided immediate benefits to the beleaguered utilityprimarily making the company look more financially secure and creditworthy because the ruling could pave the way for a recovery of more than billion for Edison Consequently attorneys and spokesmen for Edison trumpeted the ruling of US District Judge Ronald SW Lew as a significant victory Attorneys for the California Public Utilities Commission played down the decisions consequences saying it was merely the first skirmish in a long process Regardless of how significant Lews ruling was the legal battle clearly has important ramifications and they go beyond Edisons financial health Ultimately the case titled Southern California Edison vs Loretta M Lynch president of the PUC may determine whether Edisons customers have to pay more for electricity Moreover the caseand a virtually identical one filed by Pacific Gas Electric Co in Oakland federal courtmay clarify whether there will be any change in the traditional demarcation of regulatory authority over utilities as a result of deregulation Historically the federal government has regulated wholesale power rates and state governments have regulated retail rates those charged to consumers One of the key issues in the Edison and PGE cases is the utilities contention that a PUCimposed rate freeze violated the traditional demarcation by indirectly interfering with federal regulatory authority Both companies say that they have been prevented from recovering their wholesale purchase costs because of the rate freeze imposed by the PUC as part of the massive utility deregulation law enacted in known as AB Unless the issues are resolved by legislative action on the state energy crisis it seems likely that the two suits will wind up in the US th Circuit Court of Appeals and perhaps ultimately the US Supreme Court The California Public Utilities Commission and the Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group are opposing the companies in court The deregulation law provides that the California rate freeze lasts until March or until what are known as a utilitys stranded costs in essence certain assets such as nuclear power plants that were overvalued in are recovered The PUC determined last year that San Diego Gas Electric the states other major privately owned utility had recovered its stranded costs enabling that company to impose rate hikes But the agency has said that Edison and PGE are not entitled to take such action yet On Jan Judge Lew agreed in principle with Edisons contention that the Federal Power Act trumps Californias energy deregulation law Lew rejected the PUCs argument that he should dismiss the case because retail rates are exclusively a matter of state regulation The judge also rejected the agencys alternative request that he defer a decision for at least days while the PUC gathered more facts The judge said the gravity of the situation required immediate action PUC actions are having devastating effects on Edisons current ability to obtain financing to enable it to continue to procure wholesale power at current prices Lew said In essence Lew agreed with Edisons lawyers Ronald L Olson and John W Spiegel that the company is caught in a vise that threatens to squeeze it out of existence On the one side SCE has been forced to pay astronomically high prices to buy wholesale electricity the lawyers said in a brief filed in Lews court The statute requires SCE to procure all of the electricity needed to serve its million retail customers from two wholesale market institutions whose pricing practices are exclusively within the Federal Regulatory Commissions jurisdiction Since last June the cost of procuring electricity through these market institutions has increased nearly fourfold the attorneys said On the other side SCE has been unable to recover these expenses through retail rates which are currently frozen under California law In addition Edisons lawyers maintain that the PUC has interpreted California law to prohibit SCE from recovering these costs either now or in the future Consequently Edison has had to buy high and sell low leaving it with a shortfall in excess of billion the company says The PUC counters that a substantial portion of Edisons costs are paid to itself from power the company buys from its own plants and that Edison has reaped additional billions in the last two years from the sale of certain assets The agency contends that those funds should be available to offset the financial problems the company is complaining about The PUC also contends that Edison failed to take other steps that could have lowered its costs in acquiring power In addition to the dispute over the facts there has been a clash over Edison s contention that Californias rate freeze interferes with federal regulation of the wholesale energy market The PUC and the Utility Reform Network counter that the freeze is an essential component of the Federal Regulatory Commissions approval of wholesale sales The regulatory commission has taken no formal position on the pending litigation However Douglas W Smith the agencys general counsel sent a letter to Edison attorney Spiegel saying that the filed rate doctrine applies in a situation such as this The doctrine according to a US Supreme Court decision holds that interstate power rates filed with the Federal Regulatory Commission or set by it must be given binding effect by state utility commissions determining intrastate rates However Michael Strumwasser attorney for the consumers group said the Supreme Court decision arose in an entirely different context He said the specific question now at issuewhether the filed rate doctrine applies when wholesale rates have been set by market forces rather than a regulatory proceedinghas never been ruled on by an appellate court Lew made no explicit rulings on the PUC allegations that Edison should have offset wholesale payment costs through other revenues However Lew said the PUC is entitled to present evidence about the prudence of Edisons wholesale electricity purchases Further hearings on that issue could determine how much of its costs Edison is entitled to recover The PUC contends that Edison could have made some purchases at lower prices than it did But Edison attorneys counter that this is a disingenuous argument because the PUC has not objected to the prudence of Edisons purchases Indeed the Edison lawyers say the next phase of the case should be very brief because the PUC in effect consented to Edisons prior actions Attorneys for the PUC and the consumers group disagree sharply saying a bevy of issues need to be reviewed in detail There is no timetable for further proceedings in the Edison case The next hearing on the PGE case is scheduled for Jan in Oakland NEWS Stealthy Deal Protects Profits of PGEs Parents Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright PGE Corp has quietly won approval from federal regulators to restructure itself in a way that shields the parent companys profits and shareholders from the mounting debts of the utility it owns The move appears to allow Pacific Gas and Electric Cos parent to record substantial profits while maintaining that its subsidiary which supplies power to million customers is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and trying to force ratepayers to pick up the tab The corporate restructuring approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday came as a surprise to consumer advocates and state leaders dealing with the energy crisis including Gov Gray Davis They have been working feverishly the past seven days to construct a deal that would alleviate debt pressure on PGE and Southern California Edison by having the state of California buy power and provide it to the utilities at cost Steve Moviglio a spokesman for Davis said the governor was displeased by PGEs move although he said it was not likely to derail the states efforts to intervene in the crisis He also said Davis was disappointed that FERC acted in the middle of the night without notice to all parties Ratepayer advocates and even some state officials have said that any aid to the ailing utilities should be offset by the huge profits that PGE Corp has made during the crisis from electricity generation and trading revenues The money has certainly flowed in the other direction they argue In the past PGE Corp has used revenues from the utility to pay down corporate debt pay stock dividends and buy assets in other states PGE Corps action appears to eliminate that possible means of paying off at least part of the billion in debt incurred since November by its utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co as it bought power at prices higher than it can legally charge customers Its certainly a response to them feeling the threat that the holding companys going to be held responsible for all this said Bob Finkelstein an attorney for The Utility Reform Network an advocacy group Meanwhile Californias energy crisis continued in full force yesterday as the California Independent System Operator issued a Stage Two emergency meaning that demand had reached within percent of the states electric supply prompting requests to certain large users to shut down and conserve power This occurred despite a national holiday Martin Luther King Day on which most businesses were closed and demand was forecast to reach about megawatts a fairly modest number Further conditions appeared as if they were going to worsen imminently Edison said it will be unable to pay bills coming due today and PGE said it has only about million on hand to cover what it owes Bankruptcy filings by both utilities appeared more likely State leaders were still in negotiations yesterday to broker a deal in which Californias Department of Water Resources would step in and buy power on behalf of the utilities who are facing a growing inability to pay for their purchases The talks were reported to be breaking down however because Davis refused to consider raising California rates or backing utility debts with a letter of credit from the state In San Francisco state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton said legislation passed last week by the Assembly will probably make its way to the governors desk by the end of the month One bill would change the makeup of the boards that oversee the states power market and the other would prohibit utilities from selling off their powergenerating assets In the midst of yet another Stage electrical emergency the Democratic leader said I want the people of California to have long stable available energy throughout the rest of our lives But in the short term with the threat of rolling blackouts and urgent requests for power conservation Burton stated the obvious Turn the goddamn lights off he said NO CHALLENGES TO RESTRUCTURING The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved PGEs restructuring plan on a to vote on Friday It was apparently described in a Dec public notice as a stock transfer and thus flew under the radar screens of most observers Details of the plan were first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Monday Greg Pruett a spokesman for PGE Corp said the intent of the plan was merely to allow another unit of the corporate parent National Energy Group to receive its own credit rating that would be weighed independently of the troubled utility But he acknowledged that all or nearly all of PGE Corps assets outside the utility are held by National Energy Group and that the move would reduce the liability for the corporation Although it was unclear whether PGE informed state leaders of its plans Pruett said the notice of the meeting was publicly available and had at least been provided to the Public Utilities Commission In addition to proceeds from the sale of power plants and other revenues that PGE has forwarded on to its corporate parent the utility has reaped windfall profits during the crisis from the generation and sale of electricity and has not applied those profits to its own debt To do so would require an accounting rule change by the California Public Utilities Commission but company officials have maintained that should not be done PGE IN DEBT TO ITSELF Critics say that PGE is its own biggest debtor with money flying out of one pocket and into the other and that nearly half of its debt is owed to itself In the third quarter of the company reported a percent increase in profits with a net income of million while saying it expected California consumers to eventually pick up the tab for its debt ON TAP TODAY Shortage Electricity demand is expected to grow as Californians return to work from a threeday weekend increasing the likelihood of energy emergencies Talks Energy officials huddle in Washington and Sacramento over Gov Gray Davis plan for the state to buy energy for the beleaguered utilities Credit If Wall Street doesnt like the plan to rescue the states ailing utilities it may begin downgrading stock and bond ratings even to junk status Payments

tracking YK compliance among major US companies for more than a year The YK bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake for For the energy industry which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems the YK bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for YK a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly percent reported a year ago some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises They point out that the YK situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all noncompliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth Enron Corp ENEN a major US petroleum company and pipeline operator is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring Despite their best efforts to upgrade their mission critical systems those that are essential to their business the company says there is no assurance that our YK plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all noncompliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a cascading effect of system failures The problem is not and will not be unique to Enron the company added Though Enron has not announced any precautionary YK shutdowns a number of other major US pipeline operators have For example the Colonial Pipeline the largest in the nation plans an eighthour shutdown starting on New Years Eve Explorer Pipeline the second largest plans a hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston New York and Chicago In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal day inventories according to industry and government officials The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at US refineries which produce the gasoline By most accounts refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out YK problems According to Weiss Rating Co the majority of large US oil refining companies like Exxon Corp XONN and Mobil Corp MOBN are either average or above average in their adherance to YK plans mapped out more than a year ago and only a handful like Chevron Corp CHVN and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp UDSN are rated below average While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry refiners seem to be the more prepared said Dr Weiss Over all the energy sector appears to be taking the YK problem seriously but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a nonevent According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute API the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups nearly percent of the nations refiners retailers and pipeline operators will be ready for the year turnover which comes in less than two months by having YK proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down What the reports are saying is the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be YK ready and thats encouraging said an official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC But obviously nobody can make any guarantees REUTERS Rtr

resources and reserves for electricity will be megawatts short of the anticipated load in California Independent System Operator ISO President and CEO Terry Winter said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting Im concerned about supply Winter said Without sufficient supply markets will set socially and politically unacceptable price levels for wholesale power Winter said California power resources will total Mw in but load is expected to reach well over Mw Over Mw of new generation is planned for the state but most new power plants are not expected to begin service until and beyond Not helping Californias cause Winter said are reduced imports of power this year from neighboring states down from Mw in November of to Mw this November Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market You can build generation but in California natural gas and emissions are the next problems Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity hasthere is a shortage Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed since May leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series of conservation emergencies since that time The state has been under a power conservation warning much of this week As tools to solve California power woes Winter suggested the ISO file for an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated to be workably competitive The ISOs authority to set price caps which currently stands at per Mwhour expired Nov The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Nov proposed caps of Mwhour but has yet to officially rule on the matter Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load End California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity Supply Crisis FOLSOM CalifBUSINESS WIREDec via NewsEdge Corporation While grappling with another Stage Two Emergency today the California Independent System Operator California ISO is taking swift action to deal with a critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets The proposed market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy which is in short supply throughout the western United States This afternoon the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Commencing at pm today Friday December the California ISO will implement a soft cap on the ISOs RealTime Energy Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November Order Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets FERC Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC Energy bids prices in excess of MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISOs computerized scheduling system but instead will be evaluated in price merit order The California ISO has recently been placed in the position of having to negotiate prices for power in realtime and is finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while at the same time balancing supply and demand causing significant risk to the California ISOs ability to maintain reliable control of the power grid The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in realtime To the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators market participants for energy bid prices in excess of the soft cap then settlement will be asbid subject to refund if the costs cannot be verified Market participants will be required to submit cost documentation to the FERC with informational filings to the ISO and the state supporting any Energy payments priced in excess of the soft cap The current price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is unaffected Also the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to the soft cap Amendment proposes three key elements Implement a soft cap of MWh for Imbalance Energy This soft cap would limit market clearing prices to MWh but would allow market participants to submit bids over if they submit verifiable costs Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISOs realtime energy purchases to meet their loads rather than buying their own supplies in the forward markets and Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to comply with ISO dispatch instructions Amendment is posted on the ISOs website at wwwcaisocom under FERC FILINGS on the home page The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it buys in real time For the first five days of December we averaged approximately million per day However on December th we paid million December th million Failure to take action now would have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to face these extraordinary costs The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along the longdistance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system The notforprofit publicbenefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March when California opened its energy markets to competition and the states investorowned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a circuit mile electron highway Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand PORTLAND Ore Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Due to an impending power shortage federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for generation from upstream reservoirs the Bonneville Power Administration said today The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air invades the Northwest beginning this weekend The team comprises Northwest utilities the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the four Northwest states BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the Cascades BPA supplies about percent of the regions electricity most of it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency status Delwiche said The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon BPA manages the storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical generating requirements and flows for salmon BPA has the authority to exceed guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions It is very important that everyone residential and commercial consumers and industries do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity during this cold snap said Greg Delwiche BPAs vice president for generation supply Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw water from the reservoirs SOURCE Bonneville Power Administration CONTACT Ed Mosey Bonneville Power Administration Web site Calif Restarts Dirty Power Plants By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP via NewsEdge Corporation Hoping to ease the states electricity crisis airquality regulators Friday allowed the restart of several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down because they had reached air pollution limits The move came a day after California encountered an unprecedented power crunch with electricity supplies for the states million people so perilously low that California only narrowly avoided blackouts The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the Northwest the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in California On Thursday during the emergency power plants capable of producing megawatts were offline because they had exceeded their pollution limits One megawatt is sufficient to power about homes On Friday the South Coast Air Quality Management District agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity However those plants will have to pay daily fines Restarting the overpolluting plants should provide a cushion for state said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid In addition hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption Friday to avoid imposed outages Were still encouraging conservation efforts said Lori ODonley spokeswoman for the ISO Were optimistic that we wont have to impose shutdowns on commercial customers Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find power that can be diverted to California during the crunch moves that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of state The power grids managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push water from Northern California to central and southern regions The phasedin deregulation of Californias billion electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand for electricity has outstripped supply in part because of a growing population and a booming hightech economy Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the planning stages In addition deregulation has forced utilities to sell off their powergenerating assets such as dams and plants and import electricity from neighboring states where power demand is high right now because of a cold snap

questions the others role in keeping the city free of Californias energy crisis By MICHAEL FINNEGAN TERENCE MONMANEY Times Staff Writers With California mired in energy troubles Mayor Richard Riordan and his former power chief S David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los Angeles no rate hikes and no blackouts Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by waging bitter campaigns to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public Pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back To Freeman who has resigned as general manager of the LA Department of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov Gray Davis it seems Riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer California out of the energy crisis So the mayor Freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment With all due respect I have years of experience and knowledgeand he has days Freeman said But hes the mayor and he didnt like it that I didnt just say yes to everything he came up with To Riordan Freemans efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles The mayor said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis And he scoffed at Freeman for saying he had lifted morale at DWP Morale was terrible under him Riordan said I mean they are so relieved right now The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud successful men unable to say I couldnt have done it without X Y and Z Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings And the mayor a Republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with Freeman a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Southern drawl In an interview after his resignation Freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor One of his concerns Freeman said was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agencys progress in protecting the environment Freeman cited Riordans plans concerning coalfired power plants in Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP the nations largest municipal utility The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the Grand Canyon The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale He described the mayors move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees DWP were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the West Ive worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the DWP policy Freeman said And I am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress weve made The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central Utah Riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause In both cases Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los Angeles at an affordable cost By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and expanding the Utah plant Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow Riordan said Natural gas which provides of the fuel for DWP plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides The rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power providers I favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where were going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles Riordan said On the Mohave plant Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the citys share to a buyer that would simply continue running it Its still going to be coaldriven he said How does selling it help the environment The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how LA has dodged the crisis Riordan and the DWP commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches Freeman said The conflict reached its peak on April the day Freeman resigned to become the governors advisor The DWP board president Kenneth T Lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately All we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us Lombard said From Riordans standpoint Freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest The city utility sells surplus power to the state so Freeman would be on both sides of the sales Freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees In an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what Ive accomplished here he said Brian DArcy who heads the union local that represents DWP employees agreed that Riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky DArcy said Riordan said Freeman deserves an Aplus for his work at DWP The mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done to hurt Los Angeles But he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP not just by the mayor but by the agencys board and the City Council In he called for City Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors The proposal went nowhere Freemans

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

on our debts Have we had any such conversations w him I told the media yesterday we hadnt been contacted by him Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on AM From Ann M Schmidt on AM To Karen NRON cc Subject Merrill Lynch Report Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street Karen FYI Ann Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street New York M E R R I L L L Y N C H Research Bulletin Fixed Income Research Reference Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year

San Diego Gas Electric And El Paso Natural Gas LOS ANGELES Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles against Southern California Gas Company San Diego Gas amp Electric Company Sempra Energy parent of the two utilities El Paso Natural Gas Co and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices The complaints summarize the issue as follows This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering Californias electrical system and threatening Californias economy It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history Southern Californias current energy crisis is not simply the result of everincreasing demand by a growing population for energy Rather it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industrys most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity As a result Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages Para and of complaint In September of top executives of Southern California Gas Company SoCal Gas San Diego Gas amp Electric SDGampE and El Paso Natural Gas Corporation EPNG met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix Arizona Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets The conspirators sought to eliminate competition take advantage of electric deregulation drive up the price of natural gas and profit from the increased prices Para of complaint One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices the other deals with the effects on electricity prices The price of gasfired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat PDF files on the web site of the law firm of ODonnell and Shaeffer at osnews Attorneys representing the

Stem Rising Power Prices BOULDER Colo Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation With electricity prices rising like floodwaters in California and other states limited generation capacity has garnered the most attention as the culprit Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down However E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads We found that larger customers could offer almost percent of their load as negawatts temporary reductions in electricity demand says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices dont immediately affect end users prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight But if demand dropped in response to high prices LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower He explains Although theres a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today weve uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market Unfortunately most of them dont yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible They also havent been offered a pricing product they like The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis as just one example So how many negawatts are available According to the E SOURCE national market survey mediumtolarge commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by percent if offered a market price of per kWh one of the tested price points for reduced electricity usage At this price which incidentally is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December in wholesale power markets about MW could be made available across the US and about MW in California LeBlanc adds We cant expect to capture all of this potential But with the right product pricing scheme and marketing it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system The E SOURCE study Energy Pricing and Load Management What Do EndUsers Want can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs Its based on an extensive research with over energy decisionmakers across the US and

Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy Copyright Dow Jones

resources and reserves for electricity will be megawatts short of the anticipated load in California Independent System Operator ISO President and CEO Terry Winter said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting Im concerned about supply Winter said Without sufficient supply markets will set socially and politically unacceptable price levels for wholesale power Winter said California power resources will total Mw in but load is expected to reach well over Mw Over Mw of new generation is planned for the state but most new power plants are not expected to begin service until and beyond Not helping Californias cause Winter said are reduced imports of power this year from neighboring states down from Mw in November of to Mw this November Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market You can build generation but in California natural gas and emissions are the next problems Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity hasthere is a shortage Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed since May leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series of conservation emergencies since that time The state has been under a power conservation warning much of this week As tools to solve California power woes Winter suggested the ISO file for an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated to be workably competitive The ISOs authority to set price caps which currently stands at per Mwhour expired Nov The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Nov proposed caps of Mwhour but has yet to officially rule on the matter Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load End California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity Supply Crisis FOLSOM CalifBUSINESS WIREDec via NewsEdge Corporation While grappling with another Stage Two Emergency today the California Independent System Operator California ISO is taking swift action to deal with a critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets The proposed market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy which is in short supply throughout the western United States This afternoon the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Commencing at pm today Friday December the California ISO will implement a soft cap on the ISOs RealTime Energy Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November Order Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets FERC Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC Energy bids prices in excess of MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISOs computerized scheduling system but instead will be evaluated in price merit order The California ISO has recently been placed in the position of having to negotiate prices for power in realtime and is finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while at the same time balancing supply and demand causing significant risk to the California ISOs ability to maintain reliable control of the power grid The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in realtime To the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators market participants for energy bid prices in excess of the soft cap then settlement will be asbid subject to refund if the costs cannot be verified Market participants will be required to submit cost documentation to the FERC with informational filings to the ISO and the state supporting any Energy payments priced in excess of the soft cap The current price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is unaffected Also the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to the soft cap Amendment proposes three key elements Implement a soft cap of MWh for Imbalance Energy This soft cap would limit market clearing prices to MWh but would allow market participants to submit bids over if they submit verifiable costs Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISOs realtime energy purchases to meet their loads rather than buying their own supplies in the forward markets and Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to comply with ISO dispatch instructions Amendment is posted on the ISOs website at wwwcaisocom under FERC FILINGS on the home page The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it buys in real time For the first five days of December we averaged approximately million per day However on December th we paid million December th million Failure to take action now would have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to face these extraordinary costs The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along the longdistance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system The notforprofit publicbenefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March when California opened its energy markets to competition and the states investorowned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a circuit mile electron highway Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand PORTLAND Ore Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Due to an impending power shortage federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for generation from upstream reservoirs the Bonneville Power Administration said today The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air invades the Northwest beginning this weekend The team comprises Northwest utilities the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the four Northwest states BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the Cascades BPA supplies about percent of the regions electricity most of it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency status Delwiche said The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon BPA manages the storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical generating requirements and flows for salmon BPA has the authority to exceed guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions It is very important that everyone residential and commercial consumers and industries do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity during this cold snap said Greg Delwiche BPAs vice president for generation supply Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw water from the reservoirs SOURCE Bonneville Power Administration CONTACT Ed Mosey Bonneville Power Administration Web site Calif Restarts Dirty Power Plants By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP via NewsEdge Corporation Hoping to ease the states electricity crisis airquality regulators Friday allowed the restart of several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down because they had reached air pollution limits The move came a day after California encountered an unprecedented power crunch with electricity supplies for the states million people so perilously low that California only narrowly avoided blackouts The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the Northwest the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in California On Thursday during the emergency power plants capable of producing megawatts were offline because they had exceeded their pollution limits One megawatt is sufficient to power about homes On Friday the South Coast Air Quality Management District agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity However those plants will have to pay daily fines Restarting the overpolluting plants should provide a cushion for state said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid In addition hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption Friday to avoid imposed outages Were still encouraging conservation efforts said Lori ODonley spokeswoman for the ISO Were optimistic that we wont have to impose shutdowns on commercial customers Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find power that can be diverted to California during the crunch moves that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of state The power grids managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push water from Northern California to central and southern regions The phasedin deregulation of Californias billion electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand for electricity has outstripped supply in part because of a growing population and a booming hightech economy Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the planning stages In addition deregulation has forced utilities to sell off their powergenerating assets such as dams and plants and import electricity from neighboring states where power demand is high right now because of a cold snap

article which mentions Enron and the to change Oil industry has fingers crossed over YK bug By Richard Valdmanis NEW YORK Nov Reuters Despite some glowing reports on YK readiness in the US oil and gas industry private analysts and even some of the more forthcoming oil companies say there is no way to know whether the computer glitch will result in fuel shortages to consumers After all the research thats been done and all the data thats been collected we dont really know what will happen when the clock strikes on New Years Eve said Dr Martin Weiss Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc which has been tracking YK compliance among major US companies for more than a year The YK bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake for For the energy industry which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems the YK bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for YK a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly percent reported a year ago some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises They point out that the YK situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all noncompliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth Enron Corp ENEN a major US petroleum company and pipeline operator is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring Despite their best efforts to upgrade their mission critical systems those that are essential to their business the company says there is no assurance that our YK plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all noncompliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a cascading effect of system failures The problem is not and will not be unique to Enron the company added Though Enron has not announced any precautionary YK shutdowns a number of other major US pipeline operators have For example the Colonial Pipeline the largest in the nation plans an eighthour shutdown starting on New Years Eve Explorer Pipeline the second largest plans a hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston New York and Chicago In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal day inventories according to industry and government officials The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at US refineries which produce the gasoline By most accounts refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out YK problems According to Weiss Rating Co the majority of large US oil refining companies like Exxon Corp XONN and Mobil Corp MOBN are either average or above average in their adherance to YK plans mapped out more than a year ago and only a handful like Chevron Corp CHVN and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp UDSN are rated below average While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry refiners seem to be the more prepared said Dr Weiss Over all the energy sector appears to be taking the YK problem seriously but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a nonevent According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute API the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups nearly percent of the nations refiners retailers and pipeline operators will be ready for the year turnover which comes in less than two months by having YK proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down What the reports are saying is the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be YK ready and thats encouraging said an official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC But obviously nobody can make any guarantees REUTERS Rtr

questions the others role in keeping the city free of Californias energy crisis By MICHAEL FINNEGAN TERENCE MONMANEY Times Staff Writers With California mired in energy troubles Mayor Richard Riordan and his former power chief S David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los Angeles no rate hikes and no blackouts Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by waging bitter campaigns to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public Pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back To Freeman who has resigned as general manager of the LA Department of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov Gray Davis it seems Riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer California out of the energy crisis So the mayor Freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment With all due respect I have years of experience and knowledgeand he has days Freeman said But hes the mayor and he didnt like it that I didnt just say yes to everything he came up with To Riordan Freemans efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles The mayor said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis And he scoffed at Freeman for saying he had lifted morale at DWP Morale was terrible under him Riordan said I mean they are so relieved right now The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud successful men unable to say I couldnt have done it without X Y and Z Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings And the mayor a Republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with Freeman a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Southern drawl In an interview after his resignation Freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor One of his concerns Freeman said was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agencys progress in protecting the environment Freeman cited Riordans plans concerning coalfired power plants in Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP the nations largest municipal utility The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the Grand Canyon The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale He described the mayors move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees DWP were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the West Ive worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the DWP policy Freeman said And I am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress weve made The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central Utah Riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause In both cases Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los Angeles at an affordable cost By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and expanding the Utah plant Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow Riordan said Natural gas which provides of the fuel for DWP plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides The rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power providers I favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where were going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles Riordan said On the Mohave plant Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the citys share to a buyer that would simply continue running it Its still going to be coaldriven he said How does selling it help the environment The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how LA has dodged the crisis Riordan and the DWP commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches Freeman said The conflict reached its peak on April the day Freeman resigned to become the governors advisor The DWP board president Kenneth T Lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately All we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us Lombard said From Riordans standpoint Freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest The city utility sells surplus power to the state so Freeman would be on both sides of the sales Freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees In an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what Ive accomplished here he said Brian DArcy who heads the union local that represents DWP employees agreed that Riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky DArcy said Riordan said Freeman deserves an Aplus for his work at DWP The mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done to hurt Los Angeles But he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP not just by the mayor but by the agencys board and the City Council In he called for City Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors The proposal went nowhere Freemans concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday The Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP It calls for restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed But Riordan and Galanter who chairs the Councils Commerce Energy and Natural Resources Committee rejected the concept Copyright Los Angeles Times

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

loss on our debts Have we had any such conversations w him I told the media yesterday we hadnt been contacted by him Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on AM From Ann M Schmidt on AM To Karen NRON cc Subject Merrill Lynch Report Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street Karen FYI Ann Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street New York M E R R I L L L Y N C H Research Bulletin Fixed Income Research Reference Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year

San Diego Gas Electric And El Paso Natural Gas LOS ANGELES Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles against Southern California Gas Company San Diego Gas amp Electric Company Sempra Energy parent of the two utilities El Paso Natural Gas Co and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices The complaints summarize the issue as follows This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering Californias electrical system and threatening Californias economy It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history Southern Californias current energy crisis is not simply the result of everincreasing demand by a growing population for energy Rather it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industrys most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity As a result Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages Para and of complaint In September of top executives of Southern California Gas Company SoCal Gas San Diego Gas amp Electric SDGampE and El Paso Natural Gas Corporation EPNG met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix Arizona Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets The conspirators sought to eliminate competition take advantage of electric deregulation drive up the price of natural gas and profit from the increased prices Para of complaint One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices the other deals with the effects on electricity prices The price of gasfired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat PDF files on the web site of the law firm of ODonnell and Shaeffer at osnews Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews and can also provide additional materials including copies of the agenda prepared for the secret meeting as well as graphics illustrating the location of natural gas pipelines that were planned but then terminated by the defendants following the secret meeting in Phoenix For more information contact Pierce ODonnell or Carole E Handler ODonnell amp

Stem Rising Power Prices BOULDER Colo Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation With electricity prices rising like floodwaters in California and other states limited generation capacity has garnered the most attention as the culprit Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down However E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads We found that larger customers could offer almost percent of their load as negawatts temporary reductions in electricity demand says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices dont immediately affect end users prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight But if demand dropped in response to high prices LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower He explains Although theres a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today weve uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market Unfortunately most of them dont yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible They also havent been offered a pricing product they like The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis as just one example So how many negawatts are available According to the E SOURCE national market survey mediumtolarge commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by percent if offered a market price of per kWh one of the tested price points for reduced electricity usage At this price which incidentally is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December in wholesale power markets about MW could be made available across the US and about MW in California LeBlanc adds We cant expect to capture all of this potential But with the right product pricing scheme and marketing it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system The E SOURCE study Energy Pricing and Load Management What Do EndUsers Want can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs Its based on an extensive research with over energy decisionmakers across the US and Canada For further information about Energy Pricing and Load Management please call Bill LeBlanc at or Tia Hensler market research director at SOURCE E SOURCE CONTACT Bill LeBlanc or Tia Hensler

Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday

Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the

and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday

article which mentions Enron and the to change Oil industry has fingers crossed over YK bug By Richard Valdmanis NEW YORK Nov Reuters Despite some glowing reports on YK readiness in the US oil and gas industry private analysts and even some of the more forthcoming oil companies say there is no way to know whether the computer glitch will result in fuel shortages to consumers After all the research thats been done and all the data thats been collected we dont really know what will happen when the clock strikes on New Years Eve said Dr Martin Weiss Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc which has been tracking YK compliance among major US companies for more than a year The YK bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake for For the energy industry which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems the YK bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for YK a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly percent reported a year ago some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises They point out that the YK situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all noncompliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth Enron Corp ENEN a major US petroleum company and pipeline operator is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring Despite their best efforts to upgrade their mission critical systems those that are essential to their business the company says there is no assurance that our YK plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all noncompliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a cascading effect of system failures The problem is not and will not be unique to Enron the company added Though Enron has not announced any precautionary YK shutdowns a number of other major US pipeline operators have For example the Colonial Pipeline the largest in the nation plans an eighthour shutdown starting on New Years Eve Explorer Pipeline the second largest plans a hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston New York and Chicago In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal day inventories according to industry and government officials The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at US refineries which produce the gasoline By most accounts refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out YK problems According to Weiss Rating Co the majority of large US oil refining companies like Exxon Corp XONN and Mobil Corp MOBN are either average or above average in their adherance to YK plans mapped out more than a year ago and only a handful like Chevron Corp CHVN and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp UDSN are rated below average While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry refiners seem to be the more prepared said Dr Weiss Over all the energy sector appears to be taking the YK problem seriously but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a nonevent According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute API the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups nearly percent of the nations refiners retailers and pipeline operators will be ready for the year turnover which comes in less than two months by having YK proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down What the reports are saying is the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be YK ready and thats encouraging said an official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC But obviously nobody can make any guarantees REUTERS Rtr

resources and reserves for electricity will be megawatts short of the anticipated load in California Independent System Operator ISO President and CEO Terry Winter said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting Im concerned about supply Winter said Without sufficient supply markets will set socially and politically unacceptable price levels for wholesale power Winter said California power resources will total Mw in but load is expected to reach well over Mw Over Mw of new generation is planned for the state but most new power plants are not expected to begin service until and beyond Not helping Californias cause Winter said are reduced imports of power this year from neighboring states down from Mw in November of to Mw this November Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market You can build generation but in California natural gas and emissions are the next problems Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity hasthere is a shortage Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed since May leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series of conservation emergencies since that time The state has been under a power conservation warning much of this week As tools to solve California power woes Winter suggested the ISO file for an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated to be workably competitive The ISOs authority to set price caps which currently stands at per Mwhour expired Nov The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Nov proposed caps of Mwhour but has yet to officially rule on the matter Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load End California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity Supply Crisis FOLSOM CalifBUSINESS WIREDec via NewsEdge Corporation While grappling with another Stage Two Emergency today the California Independent System Operator California ISO is taking swift action to deal with a critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets The proposed market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy which is in short supply throughout the western United States This afternoon the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Commencing at pm today Friday December the California ISO will implement a soft cap on the ISOs RealTime Energy Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November Order Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets FERC Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC Energy bids prices in excess of MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISOs computerized scheduling system but instead will be evaluated in price merit order The California ISO has recently been placed in the position of having to negotiate prices for power in realtime and is finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while at the same time balancing supply and demand causing significant risk to the California ISOs ability to maintain reliable control of the power grid The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in realtime To the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators market participants for energy bid prices in excess of the soft cap then settlement will be asbid subject to refund if the costs cannot be verified Market participants will be required to submit cost documentation to the FERC with informational filings to the ISO and the state supporting any Energy payments priced in excess of the soft cap The current price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is unaffected Also the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to the soft cap Amendment proposes three key elements Implement a soft cap of MWh for Imbalance Energy This soft cap would limit market clearing prices to MWh but would allow market participants to submit bids over if they submit verifiable costs Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISOs realtime energy purchases to meet their loads rather than buying their own supplies in the forward markets and Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to comply with ISO dispatch instructions Amendment is posted on the ISOs website at wwwcaisocom under FERC FILINGS on the home page The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it buys in real time For the first five days of December we averaged approximately million per day However on December th we paid million December th million Failure to take action now would have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to face these extraordinary costs The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along the longdistance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system The notforprofit publicbenefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March when California opened its energy markets to competition and the states investorowned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a circuit mile electron highway Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand PORTLAND Ore Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Due to an impending power shortage federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for generation from upstream reservoirs the Bonneville Power Administration said today The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air invades the Northwest beginning this weekend The team comprises Northwest utilities the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the four Northwest states BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the Cascades BPA supplies about percent of the regions electricity most of it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency status Delwiche said The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon BPA manages the storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical generating requirements and flows for salmon BPA has the authority to exceed guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions It is very important that everyone residential and commercial consumers and industries do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity during this cold snap said Greg Delwiche BPAs vice president for generation supply Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw water from the reservoirs SOURCE Bonneville Power Administration CONTACT Ed Mosey Bonneville Power Administration Web site Calif Restarts Dirty Power Plants By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP via NewsEdge Corporation Hoping to ease the states electricity crisis airquality regulators Friday allowed the restart of several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down because they had reached air pollution limits The move came a day after California encountered an unprecedented power crunch with electricity supplies for the states million people so perilously low that California only narrowly avoided blackouts The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the Northwest the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in California On Thursday during the emergency power plants capable of producing megawatts were offline because they had exceeded their pollution limits One megawatt is sufficient to power about homes On Friday the South Coast Air Quality Management District agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity However those plants will have to pay daily fines Restarting the overpolluting plants should provide a cushion for state said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid In addition hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption Friday to avoid imposed outages Were still encouraging conservation efforts said Lori ODonley spokeswoman for the ISO Were optimistic that we wont have to impose shutdowns on commercial customers Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find power that can be diverted to California during the crunch moves that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of state The power grids managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push water from Northern California to central and southern regions The phasedin deregulation of Californias billion electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand for electricity has outstripped supply in part because of a growing population and a booming hightech economy Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the planning stages In addition deregulation has forced utilities to sell off their powergenerating assets such as dams and plants and import electricity from neighboring states where power demand is high right now because of a cold snap

lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices The complaints summarize the issue as follows This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering Californias electrical system and threatening Californias economy It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history Southern Californias current energy crisis is not simply the result of everincreasing demand by a growing population for energy Rather it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industrys most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity As a result Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages Para and of complaint In September of top executives of Southern California Gas Company SoCal Gas San Diego Gas amp Electric SDGampE and El Paso Natural Gas Corporation EPNG met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix Arizona Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets The conspirators sought to eliminate competition take advantage of electric deregulation drive up the price of natural gas and profit from the increased prices Para of complaint One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices the other deals with the effects on electricity prices The price of gasfired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat PDF files on the web site of the law firm of ODonnell and Shaeffer at osnews Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews and can also provide additional materials including copies of the agenda prepared for the secret meeting as well as graphics illustrating the location of natural gas pipelines that were planned but then terminated by the defendants following the secret meeting in Phoenix For more information contact Pierce ODonnell or Carole E Handler ODonnell amp

Stem Rising Power Prices BOULDER Colo Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation With electricity prices rising like floodwaters in California and other states limited generation capacity has garnered the most attention as the culprit Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down However E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads We found that larger customers could offer almost percent of their load as negawatts temporary reductions in electricity demand says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices dont immediately affect end users prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight But if demand dropped in response to high prices LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower He explains Although theres a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today weve uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market Unfortunately most of them dont yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible They also havent been offered a pricing product they like The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis as just one example So how many negawatts are available According to the E SOURCE national market survey mediumtolarge commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by percent if offered a market price of per kWh one of the tested price points for reduced electricity usage At this price which incidentally is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December in wholesale power markets about MW could be made available across the US and about MW in California LeBlanc adds We cant expect to capture all of this potential But with the right product pricing scheme and marketing it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system The E SOURCE study Energy Pricing and Load Management What Do EndUsers Want can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs Its based on an extensive research with over energy decisionmakers across the US and Canada For further information about Energy Pricing and Load Management please call Bill LeBlanc at or Tia Hensler market research director at SOURCE E SOURCE CONTACT Bill LeBlanc or Tia Hensler

loss on our debts Have we had any such conversations w him I told the media yesterday we hadnt been contacted by him Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on AM From Ann M Schmidt on AM To Karen NRON cc Subject Merrill Lynch Report Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street Karen FYI Ann Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street New York M E R R I L L L Y N C H Research Bulletin Fixed Income Research Reference Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year contract Earlier in February CPN had reached agreement with the DWR on a separate year contract for an additional mws EIX WMB MLPFS was a manager of the most recent public offering of securities of

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

questions the others role in keeping the city free of Californias energy crisis By MICHAEL FINNEGAN TERENCE MONMANEY Times Staff Writers With California mired in energy troubles Mayor Richard Riordan and his former power chief S David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los Angeles no rate hikes and no blackouts Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by waging bitter campaigns to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public Pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back To Freeman who has resigned as general manager of the LA Department of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov Gray Davis it seems Riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer California out of the energy crisis So the mayor Freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment With all due respect I have years of experience and knowledgeand he has days Freeman said But hes the mayor and he didnt like it that I didnt just say yes to everything he came up with To Riordan Freemans efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles The mayor said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis And he scoffed at Freeman for saying he had lifted morale at DWP Morale was terrible under him Riordan said I mean they are so relieved right now The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud successful men unable to say I couldnt have done it without X Y and Z Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings And the mayor a Republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with Freeman a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Southern drawl In an interview after his resignation Freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor One of his concerns Freeman said was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agencys progress in protecting the environment Freeman cited Riordans plans concerning coalfired power plants in Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP the nations largest municipal utility The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the Grand Canyon The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale He described the mayors move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees DWP were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the West Ive worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the DWP policy Freeman said And I am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress weve made The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central Utah Riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause In both cases Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los Angeles at an affordable cost By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and expanding the Utah plant Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow Riordan said Natural gas which provides of the fuel for DWP plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides The rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power providers I favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where were going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles Riordan said On the Mohave plant Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the citys share to a buyer that would simply continue running it Its still going to be coaldriven he said How does selling it help the environment The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how LA has dodged the crisis Riordan and the DWP commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches Freeman said The conflict reached its peak on April the day Freeman resigned to become the governors advisor The DWP board president Kenneth T Lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately All we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us Lombard said From Riordans standpoint Freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest The city utility sells surplus power to the state so Freeman would be on both sides of the sales Freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees In an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what Ive accomplished here he said Brian DArcy who heads the union local that represents DWP employees agreed that Riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky DArcy said Riordan said Freeman deserves an Aplus for his work at DWP The mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done to hurt Los Angeles But he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP not just by the mayor but by the agencys board and the City Council In he called for City Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors The proposal went nowhere Freemans concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday The Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP It calls for restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed But

on our debts Have we had any such conversations w him I told the media yesterday we hadnt been contacted by him Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on AM From Ann M Schmidt on AM To Karen NRON cc Subject Merrill Lynch Report Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street Karen FYI Ann Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street New York M E R R I L L L Y N C H Research Bulletin Fixed Income Research Reference Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year contract Earlier in February CPN had reached agreement with the DWR on a separate year contract for an additional mws EIX WMB MLPFS was a manager of the most recent public offering of securities of

San Diego Gas Electric And El Paso Natural Gas LOS ANGELES Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles against Southern California Gas Company San Diego Gas amp Electric Company Sempra Energy parent of the two utilities El Paso Natural Gas Co and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices The complaints summarize the issue as follows This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering Californias electrical system and threatening Californias economy It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history Southern Californias current energy crisis is not simply the result of everincreasing demand by a growing population for energy Rather it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industrys most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity As a result Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages Para and of complaint In September of top executives of Southern California Gas Company SoCal Gas San Diego Gas amp Electric SDGampE and El Paso Natural Gas Corporation EPNG met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix Arizona Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets The conspirators sought to eliminate competition take advantage of electric deregulation drive up the price of natural gas and profit from the increased prices Para of complaint One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices the other deals with the effects on electricity prices The price of gasfired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat PDF files on the web site of the law firm of ODonnell and Shaeffer at osnews Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews and can also provide additional materials including copies of the agenda prepared for the secret meeting as well as graphics illustrating the location of natural gas pipelines that were planned but then terminated by the defendants following the secret meeting in Phoenix For more information contact Pierce ODonnell or Carole E Handler ODonnell amp

Stem Rising Power Prices BOULDER Colo Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation With electricity prices rising like floodwaters in California and other states limited generation capacity has garnered the most attention as the culprit Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down However E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads We found that larger customers could offer almost percent of their load as negawatts temporary reductions in electricity demand says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices dont immediately affect end users prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight But if demand dropped in response to high prices LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower He explains Although theres a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today weve uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market Unfortunately most of them dont yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible They also havent been offered a pricing product they like The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis as just one example So how many negawatts are available According to the E SOURCE national market survey mediumtolarge commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by percent if offered a market price of per kWh one of the tested price points for reduced electricity usage At this price which incidentally is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December in wholesale power markets about MW could be made available across the US and about MW in California LeBlanc adds We cant expect to capture all of this potential But with the right product pricing scheme and marketing it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system The E SOURCE study Energy Pricing and Load Management What Do EndUsers Want can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs Its based on an extensive research with over energy decisionmakers across the US and Canada For further information about Energy Pricing and Load Management please call Bill LeBlanc at or Tia Hensler market research director at SOURCE E SOURCE CONTACT Bill LeBlanc or Tia Hensler

investigating about large companies for accounting fraud and many of these inquiries focus on the companies top executives the SECs chief lawenforcement official said A lot of the fraud seems to be resulting from executives feeling pressure to beat stock analysts expectations SEC Enforcement Director Richard H Walker said in an interview Friday The SEC is conducting about accounting fraud investigations about times the number of such cases that were filed last year Walker said In last years cases charges were filed against chief executives and chief financial officers SEC data show Among the large companies that have disclosed that they are under investigation are Xerox Corp ConAgra Foods Inc and Lucent Technologies Inc Walker said the number of investigations of large companies this year represents a big jump over last year though he said the agency didnt have an exact count of probes of major firms More than half the SEC cases in which charges were filed recently allege that companies reported revenue in the wrong period usually in an attempt to inflate lagging quarterly earnings Walker said Accounting executives have said companies often have to interpret dated SEC reporting rules that dont easily apply to changing business conditions leaving corporations vulnerable to secondguessing by regulators But regulators argue that companies and their auditors may be stretching accounting rules too far simply to appease analysts and investors Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt who left the agency in February made financial fraud the agencys chief enforcement priority during the last couple of years of his tenure Levitt said executives engage in a game of nods and winks with analysts in an attempt to prop up their companies stock prices Walker had said Levitts departure wouldnt affect the agencys investigative priorities Last month the SEC filed fraud charges against Arthur Andersen which agreed to pay million to settle allegations it issued false

Wednesday NEW YORK Dow Jones With the value of its stock continuing to plummet E nron Corp ENE tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press r elease touting among other things increased liquidity The problem is that most of the socalled news was three days old recycled from the companys latest quarterly filing And investors werent fooled by the release Although the stock of the emba ttled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the rele ase climbing to a share from it quickly gave up most of its g ains One hour after the release Enron stock was back trading at a s hare down more than on the day They had to say something but really didnt have any new news Its quite incredible said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron Amid mounting fears that Enrons credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc DYN a merger that many see as the only way for E nron to avoid possible bankruptcy Enron began its press release by announc ing that it has closed on the remaining million of a previously annou nced billion in secured credit lines Great news given the way Enron has been burning through cash Except that investors who took time to read Enrons filing with the Securities and Exch ange Commission on Monday already knew that on November Enron cl osed a million new secured line of credit which will mature in the fo urth quarter of Readers of the companys Q also knew that the million credit was secured by the assets of Enrons Northern Natural Gas Co Meanwhile the real news everyone was waiting for an announcement about wh ether a million loan due next Tuesday had been extended has yet to be finalized Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to midDecembe r would be formalized soon Separately people familiar with the matter said JP Morgan Chase Co an d Citigroup Inc continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the syndicated loan which contains a clause that unbeknownst to many was tri ggered by Enrons ratings downgrade to BBB by Standard Poors Corp ea rlier this month The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the million note on November if it didnt post collateral Those people said that the syndicated loan which is built inside a structu red vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors around the world would likely be extended to the middle of when other bank loans to Enron come due About billion of Enrons billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May and will likely need to be re structured About million of the assets securing the million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan reducing the o utstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured according to the people familiar with the terms Meanwhile Dynegy also tried to rally although somewhat halfheartedly inv estors around its plan to acquire Enrons stock Dynegy said it was encoura ged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining million credit facil ity and news of the extension of the million loan Under the terms of the acquisition Enron holders would receive Dynegy share for each E nron share Investors however remain more circumspect unmoved by the whopping r isk premium currently attached to the merger Thats how much investors bu ying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come analys ts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enrons liquidity or lac k thereof going forward Were having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion from the banks even with the billion from Dynegy will provide enough liquid ity for Enron one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron Chevron Texaco w hich owns of Dynegy already injected billion into Enron Another billion is expected upon closing of the deal Carol S Remond Dow Jones Newswires om USA Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs By Ellen Chang Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Nov Reuters Houstons economy buffered by a broad and dive rse tax base should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t he citys major corporations including energy powerhouse Enron Corp econ omists and analysts said Financially ailing Enron Corp which has employees worldwide and i s in talks to be bought by Houstonbased rival Dynegy Inc is the third m ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m onths Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs Continental announced a layoff of employees after the Sept attack s and HewlettPackard Cos plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp will if fina lized result in layoffs at the two companies Compaq also announced layoffs worldwide in July Its fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co ntinental taken alone are negative factors although probably small in th e grand scope of the Houston economy said Phil Scheps director of Housto ns finance and administration department Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships the energ y giants market share has steadily eroded While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l ayoffs that could hit Houston Barton Smith director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston said the layoffs will b e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive Robin Kapiloff an

billion Still the national recession energy price weakness in general and the in itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to percent from percent That revised estimate equals a million reduction in the citys bi llion budget But the citys property tax revenue has not been affected Only a small cha nge in property tax collections is expected in because valuations are based on Jan data and for most of real estate growth was very larg e Scheps said While recent economic indicators appear positive and consumer

Jones Business News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp Dynegy Inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult ibilliondollar deal Fridays Wall Street Journal reported The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron E NE shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energytradin g company the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas Du ring the past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revi sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billio n reduction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC filing Monday Enron disclosed hu ndreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possib ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t han billion in loans by the end of the year As of pm Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares fell or to each after having dropped Tuesday In excess of million shares traded Wednesday more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock Enrons bonds also again traded sharpl y lower market observers said The turmoil spilled over to Dynegys stock which also was among the most a ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange As of pm Wednesday Dyne gy DYN shares fell to each On Wednesday Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi ve Chuck Watson said his company was working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued to perform due diligence on Enr on Under the merger agreement Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enrons financial and legal problems become severe e nough However some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so called material adverse change clauses They point to a decision earlier th is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc to c omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc even though Tyson a Springdale Ark foodproducts company had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBPs earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit Dynegy officials didnt return calls seeking comment To complete the deal twothirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou ld have to give their approval No dates for those votes have been set One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr on contained information Dynegy hadnt known about Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i nformation as part of the companys due diligence this person said It cou ldnt be determined what the new information was The merger agreement announced Nov calls for Dynegy to exchange share for each of Enrons roughly million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about each or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerformula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme nt when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra ding relatively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houstonbased Dynegy Dynegy and Enron officia ls have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about Dynegy share for each Enron share Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Financial Post Investing Enron casts pall on analysts Everyone had a buy on the stock all the way down Steve Maich Financial Post with files from news services National Post National IN Front c National Post All Rights Reserved For thousands of people burned by Enron Corps spectacular implosion it m ust have been tough to feel thankful yesterday Over the past month the Houstonbased company has admitted its earnings re ports going back four years are useless written down billions in worthless investments and fired its chief financial officer in a failed bid to shor e up its plunging stock The slide in Enrons stock ENENYSE has already wiped out USbillion i n shareholder wealth Now it may lose its last lifeline a USbillion takeover offer from Dynegy Inc Enrons fall is proving to be more than just a cautionary tale about sketch y accounting The case is raising serious questions about the responsibilit y of analysts who strongly recommended a stock that many now admit they nev er really understood The public isnt going to trust stock analysts for awhile said Scott Pre ston a San Franciscobased analyst with Research Capital Corp who does no t cover Enron Every analyst had a buy on the stock And its not like the re was only one little issue there Its a mess and big brokerages were com ing out as it was on the way down saying put this thing in your Grandmother s RRSP But Wall Streets embarrassment pales next to the pain of shareholders inc luding Enron employees whose pensions were loaded with the stock I have lost my savings my plans for the future everything Roy Rinard a longtime Enron staffer said this week as he announced that employees ha ve banded together for a classaction lawsuit against the company Several analysts have acknowledged that Enrons financial statements were r outinely incomprehensible But with brokerages vying for the millions of do llars in equity and bond underwriting business Enron provided every year m any analysts chose to focus on the companys growth and failed to ask toug h questions about its books Critics say the red flags were waving long ago The first clear sign of trouble came Aug when Jeffrey Skilling quit th e CEO job he took over just seven months earlier citing personal reasons Former chief executive Kenneth Lay reclaimed the job Our business is stro ng and our growth prospects have never been better Mr Lay said at the ti me In fact cracks were already appearing in the business Enrons plan to sta rt trading capacity on fibre optic networks was a costly failure and the c ompany was locked in a prolonged dispute with the Indian government over en ergy purchases in the region In October Enron surprised investors by reporting its first quarterly loss in more than four years due in large part to the writedown of USbillio n in bad investments Within a week the US Securities and Exchange Commi ssion started investigating Enrons finances The company soon admitted major accounting errors dating back to Its profits had been overstated by USmillion or The company revealed that some of the investments it had written off were limited partnerships headed by CFO Andrew Fastow a serious breach of good corporate governanc e Mr Fastow was fired but it didnt stop Enrons descent The pain may be far from over Facing a year of regulatory hearings to approve the merger and a rapidly d evaluing asset in Enron many fear Dynegy will walk away from the deal If that happens Enron may be doomed The stock closed Wednesday at US down this year Dynegy closed at US valuing the Enron offer at US a share The fact that Enron s stock is trading so far below the offer price is a sure sign that invest ors doubt it will proceed at least not at the current offer price All this has left investors wondering how so many could have been so wrong about so much And how can so many continue to endorse the stock Of the analysts that cover the stock still rate it a buy Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleisher removed Enron from his recommended list this w eek but only after his firm was excluded from the banking syndicate arrang ing the Dynegy deal Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities dropped Enron from buy to sell this week citing its long history of

Enron but the Blackstone Group which was reported to be talk ing to the company before Dynegy Inc made its USbillion rescue bid is understood not to be talking to Enron any longer Members of the strong bank lending group led by JP Morgan Chase and Cit igroup are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt unti l after completion of the merger The move comes as reports from Goldman Sachs Co and Fitch the credit ra ting agency raised questions about the companys cash flow and its medium term viability David Fleischer a Goldman Sachs analyst argued that cash balances were in adequate to meet USbillion of debt obligations falling due before the end of the year People close to Enron say that nearly USbillion of that debt has already been restructured The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed Enron would struggle to meet USbillion of obligations due before the end of next y ear People close to Enron insisted Dynegy remained committed to the merger and played down talk of renegotiation Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the de al they predicted But bankers acknowledged the fate of the Dynegy deal was largely irrelevant in terms of the companys immediate liquidity problems The company has raised about USbillion in cash enough to cover its oper ating costs since a USbillion writedown of shareholder

Bid for Enron Appears Less Appealing Merger Deal Loses Luster as Shares Tumble Acquisition Target Faces Numerous Earnings Problems By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters The Wall Street Journal Europe Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp Dynegy Inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult ibilliondollar deal The pressure is coming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shar es and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energytrading compan y the biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas in the US In the p ast month Enron has taken a billion billion euros writeoff of as sets restated downward the past several years of earnings and taken a billion reduction in shareholder equity The problems owe largely to deali ngs Enron had with private partnerships run by some of its own executives n ow under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission In d ocuments filed with the SEC on Monday Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possibility that its wea kening financial condition could force it to repay more than billion in loans by the end of the year On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday Enron shares were down at each after having dropped some on Tuesday There was no trading Thu rsday More than million shares changed hands Wednesday more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock Enrons bonds also fell tr aders said The turmoil spilled over to Dynegys shares which were also among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange Dynegy shares were at each on Wednesday down Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was worki ng to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued doing due diligence review on Enron Under the merger agreement Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enrons financi al and legal problems become severe enough Dynegy officials didnt return calls seeking comment To consummate the dea l twothirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders w ould have to give their approval No dates for those votes have been set The merger agreement announced Nov calls for Dynegy to exchange of its shares for each of Enrons roughly million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price point of view the deal is looking ever less attracti ve to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about a share or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerform ula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading rel atively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts is also turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Dynegy Dynegy and Enron executives have predi cted that the merger which is supposed to be completed late next year wou ld significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said that because of Enrons financial problems a comb ined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said a likely scenario is that the merger for mula will be renegotiated sharply lower to about Dynegy shares for eac h Enron share Such a move wouldnt be without precedent According to a person familiar w ith the merger negotiations Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least o nce prior to the Nov announcement because of Enrons rapidly sinking sto ck price which at the beginning of this year was above a share In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street Go ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy A longtime Enron fan Mr Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha t the merger would help Dynegys earnings and whether Enron could recover the significant business that has been lost in its energy trading operatio ns The Enron machine continues to sputter wrote Mr Fleischer Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to sig nificantly renegotiate the terms Enron might be pushed into bankruptcy Wi thout the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and cus tomers an Enron request for bankruptcy protection from creditors is highl y possible said Ralph Pellecchia a senior director at Fitch a creditra tings agency On Wednesday Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment grade or junk status But Fitch also said that Enrons trading partners had made significant cash collateral ca lls in recent days that are well in excess of previous expectations con tributing to liquidity pressures Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir m of Weil Gotshal Manges which has a specialty in bankruptcy and corpor ate restructuring One energy trader said Wednesday that some colleagues ha d even started a betting pool about the timing of a possible Enron bankrupt cy filing But he quickly added that he had no knowledge that the company h as contemplated such a step Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing an Enron spokeswoman said the com pany expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesnt

growing disclosur es of financial problems in recent weeks the company locked down the ret irement plan from Oct to Nov to make administrative changes which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed Enron which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc Houston becaus e of mounting financial problems has seen its stock price fall to on Wednesday from a peak of nearly a share last year The decline has bee n costly to participants in Enrons retirement plan because more than o f the k assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year according to one of the suits The first suit was filed Nov on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison Wright LLP a Houston law firm and the second was filed Tuesda y by Seattlebased Hagens Berman LLP Both seek classaction certification Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits A sp okeswoman also said the companys k plan offers participants invest ment choices one of which

Securities and Exchange Commission has la unched a formal investigation into the companys accounting and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c ompanies over losses in the companystock portion of their k plans Th e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu ing to offer company stock even after they became aware of serious busines s problems that would hurt the stock price All the suits are pending As with most of these companies Enron matches employee contributions to th e k with shares of Enron stock and also offers Enron stock as an inve stment choice in addition to a variety of mutual funds About billion of the plans billion in assets was

trustees of the Enron k plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril The suit filed by Hagens Berman also alleges that the company failed

pension law companies are allowed to offer their own stock i n retirement plans and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto ck Enron doesnt let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat ching contributions to the k plan until age However plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes ts of the participants which includes choosing prudent investments Genera lly to prove that the plans administrators breached their fiduciary dutie s employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen t This presents a high hurdle so it is not

Lucent say their companies didnt require employee s to invest in the company stock and educated employees about the need for diversification The suit in which Mr Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct

doubt things will get this bad still giving the deal a chance of going through BusinessFinancial Desk Section C From Sunbeam to Enron Andersens Reputation Suffers By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem ent case Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar thur Andersen in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the companys reported profits in recent years All of which raises the question Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee p of the accounting industry It is not an easy question to answer and not everyone is willing to rush t o judgment If you want to attack Andersen for Enron you need to know mo re than we know Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said this week But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases it is materiality In all three cases Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea d Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble The idea is that it doesnt much matter if a few little things we re gotten wrong But they can add up At Enron however they did not add up to that much a total of milli on over four years The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated It is not cle ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time To those who treasure the role of auditors the humiliation of Andersen is painful Back in the s it was Leonard Spacek Andersens managing par tner who warned that the professions existence is in peril because it was not showing enough independence His public prodding was crucial in ma king the industry do a better job Two decades ago when the issue on the t able was pension accounting Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules Now Andersens backbone is open to question It was evidence that senior pe ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the SEC to bring that suit which the firm chose to settle without a dmitting it had done anything wrong The partner that the SEC says looke d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations and Andersen says h e acted properly Lynn Turner who was chief accountant of the SEC at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un iversity says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap pened to Coopers Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s eries of highly publicized blown audits We got bludgeoned to death in the press he said People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps It was brutal but we deserved it We h ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting For Andersen to avoid that fate its relatively new chief executive Joseph Berardino who declined to be interviewed for this column will need to se t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr Spacek epitomized And then he will have to convince the public of that Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A

electricity and natural gas During t he past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revised do wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billion redu ction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC

challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about Dynegy share for each Enron share Such a ratcheting down wouldnt be without precedent in the deal According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations Dynegy reduced the ex change formula at least once prior to the Nov announcement because of En rons rapidly sinking stock price which at the beginning of this year was above a share In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street Go ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer

hurdle because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring substantially i dentical securities within a day period before or after that loss This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri ces now make them attractive buy candidates In addition the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w ashsale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an inthemoney pu t because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir ed by the investor So investors typically get around the washsale rule by doubling up buyi ng additional stock or options waiting at least days and then selling the original stock to book the loss Investors double up by buying calls w hich locks a price

Energy WatchPlattsDirect To Launch In Rough Waters By Jeremy Bowden Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN SINGAPORE Dow Jones Credit concerns at Enron Online and repeated delays to the launch of eNymex have dramatically altered the outlook for online e nergy trading over recent months The bigoil backed Internet site Intercontinental Exchange or ICE has so far been the main beneficiary of its competitors problems with recent tr ade volumes jumping sharply But its growing hegemony may soon be challenge d by a very different online trading system run by Platts a unit of publi sher McGrawHill Cos MHP Aware of sensitivity to its role in oil markets from within the industry P latts is approaching electronic trading with a very different business mode l from existing commissionbased sites Platts sources say its new system dubbed PlattsDirect is designed initi ally at least as a communication device to enhance its existing role of assessing and publishing benchmark energy prices Its current telephoneba sed systems they say cant cope with rising liquidity all of which must be factored in when making its price assessments They hope PlattsDirect will develop as a master exchange providing a ne utral base for other exchanges to feed pricing information in order to co mpliment Platts leading role as price benchmark assessor and publisher PlattsDirect is more likely to charge a subscription fee than commissions sources said although a final decision has yet to be made Unlike some oth er systems PlattsDirect will offer no clearing or counterparty service While a launch date hasnt been fixed Platts hopes PlattsDirect will be up and running in early Nymex by contrast is without a launch date for its eNymex Internet system which has suffered repeated delays since its o riginal launch date of October Is Nymex Leaving It Too Late Some oil traders suggest Nymex has missed the boat in its efforts to deve lop electronic trading bogged down by its desire to keep local floor trade rs happy In September Nymex President J Robert Collins said the launch of eNymex h ad been delayed by factors including the bankruptcy of one of the systems developers Globalview Software Inc according to industry publications Oi l and Gas Journal and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly But several months later Globalview continues to be alive and well despit e legal action taken against it by Nymex and has posted a increase in sales so far this year A senior Globalview official said his company is co untersuing without providing further details ICE invited Nymex to join it last year but Nymex rejected the offer prefe rring to focus on its own electronic system In June ICE acquired Londons International Petroleum Exchange which plans to scrap floor trading and a dopt electronic trading for all its products Enron Corps ENE Enron Online faces even more serious problems than Nyme x Oil trading sources say it has seen a sharp reduction in trade volume ov er recent weeks as counterparties grow increasingly wary over the companys financial position The system Enron designed to reduce credit risk wher e Enron itself acts as a counterparty to every online trade appears to ha ve backfired Even if the system is successfully transferred to Dynegy Inc DYN which has agreed to take over Enron pending legal objections trading sources say counterparties are likely to be wary of placing so much risk with a sin gle company again leaving the Enron Online trading model at a disadvantage They added that unless the Dynegy takeover is quick Enron Online liquidity could dry up completely Enron itself has warned that reduced trading acti vity will hit fourthquarter earnings Platts Independence Physical Trade Advantageous While it doesnt appear keen to compete with other systems headon initiall y PlattsDirect has several advantages which could persuade traders to use its system A possible absence of commissions is of concern to Singapore br okers and probably other online sites too Platts sources claim the sites independence and resulting objectivity is a lso a major advantage over other sites But the concern for Platts is that that very independence also means it has no guaranteed support from within the trading community ICE by contrast was developed and is owned by a selection of companies in volved in the trading of oil including oil majors BP PLC BP Total Fina Elf SA TOT and Royal DutchShell Group RD and enjoys IPE support PlattsDirect is also able to offer physical trade unique so far among on line energy trading sites Some traders say Platts existing role as a publ isher of benchmark oil price assessments particularly in Asia is bound to attract trade to the new system Some companies will want to trade on PlattsDirect because prices from the system will be used when assessing benchmarks said one trader The majori ty of physical oil trade is priced against benchmarks rather than on a spot basis and most overthecounter derivative products are also settled agai nst Platts benchmark assessments including Nymex Brent and many on ICE Platts claims physical and derivative products worth US billion are trad ed against its benchmark quotes everyday and this makes influencing those quotes a priority for traders Platts also plans to use the prices of oil derivative trades from PlattsDir ect to improve the accuracy of its daily assessments of forward prices However Platts must be careful It not only faces wariness from existing i ndustrydriven sites it cant afford to undermine the independence of its parent company credit rating agency Standard Poors a unit of McGrawHi ll Part of the loss of faith in Enrons creditworthiness came as Moodys and S tandard Poors downgraded Enrons credit rating to Baa and BBB respecti vely just above junk bond status However justified the downgrade Standa rd Poors cant be seen to gain competitive advantage for a unit through a change in a clients credit assessment ICE is also considering the introduction of physical trade and could event ually publish competing benchmark assessments But without an existing pres ence in the energy benchmark publishing business ICE would face an uphill struggle And its owners involvement in trading could also be seen as comp romising its objectivity when assessing

another downgrade will cause the company to repay refinance or cash c ollateralize another billion Short story the companys unravelling Did it have to come to this Judging from the offbalance sheet shenanigans at the company the answer to that question is a clear yes We need only c onsider the moment in when Enrons board endorsed a move by none other than its own chief financial officer to head up a couple of whollyowned s ubsidiaries that would do business with the principal company The results of the subsidiaries would not be consolidated on Enrons balance sheet A s prinkling of insiders constituted the review and approval team that would o versee the transactions Andrew Fastow was the lucky CFO Lucky is an apt description as Enron has now disclosed that Fastow earned more than million from a host of manag ement and investment activities through both the subsidiaries and related p artnerships called JEDI and Chewco Yes they were named in honour of the Star Wars movies Enron always had a reputation for being fast and entrepreneurial Investors just never knew how fast and entrepreneurial the company was Fastow was p ushed out the door three weeks ago The companys treasurer and its general counsel were fired Both had participated in a limited partnership that ha d purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of the Fastow subsidiaries Its as simple as that Some of the Fastow transactions involving investments in power projects fr om Poland to Brazil or call options on gas turbines are as clear as mud O thers are more transparent Example in December Enron sold an

assumed the sellerfinan ced note from Enron When LJM subsequently sold the investment it repaid t he Enron note and pocketed a profit There are plenty of conflict of interest examples Plus numerous losses tha t should have accrued to Enron as a result of the subsidiaries activities losses that the company thought it would rather not recognize Chastened Enron has established a special committee

to do busi ness with the company Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns said Michael Barbis an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners As a result the market per ceives Enron as needing more cash The very methods that contributed to Enrons rapid rise are generally seen now as the reason for its woes Enron established in grew from a modest natural gas pipeline company with annual revenue of less than billion to an energy giant with revenu e pegged at about billion this year To finance this explosive rate of growth the company created a vast and im penetrable network of affiliated entities or partnerships to divert billion s of dollars of debt which would have jeopardized Enrons credit rating and limited growth from its balance sheet But the offbalance sheet transactions caught up with the company in recent months with Enron announcing a million thirdquarter loss and disclo sed a billion reduction in shareholder equity in part because of the p artnerships The company followed with more disturbing news saying earnings have been o verstated by about million since The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating Enron in r elation to the partnerships some of which were headed by former Enron exec utives Lawsuits have also been flying at the company as shareholders line up in an attempt to recover more than billion in lost market value since Septem ber Meanwhile its wouldbe acquirer Dynegy hasnt been immune to the fallout of the latest developments Its stock dropped yesterday too and at is well below the it hit last week but above the low it was tr ading at before the merger deal was announced Analysts said that if the merger goes through Dynegy stands to gain consid erably The company estimates the addition of Enron will beef up its bottom line by about per cent or to cents a share next year a sizable c hunk of profit that would justify a share price in the to range The outlook for earnings over the next couple of years assuming the acqui sition of Enron is successful is significant said Mr Worms of Gerard Kl auer Mattison Despite Enrons latest troubles he maintained a buy ratin g on Dynegy with a month target of Dynegy has also taken moves to limit its downside The company is injecting billion of cash into Enron but it gets rights to Enrons prized kilometre Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment if Enron goes under As well the merger agreement specifies that Dynegy can walk away from the deal if legal costs exceed billion The bet here is can Dynegys management pull this off and can

Dow Jones Newswires The Wall Street Journal Europe Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON An accounting industry watchdog wont investigate auditing pr oblems at Enron Corp despite a request from a senior US lawmaker but ma y take a broader look at whats causing recent audit debacles Investigation of the Enron situation rests with the SEC Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher said We cant run a separate investigatio n The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining accounting and audit pr oblems at Houstonbased Enron focusing on investments in limited partnersh ips tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Enron has acknowl edged it overstated net income by million million euros and wi ll need to restate five years of financial reports Citing concerns about the accounting industrys peerreview process Rep J ohn Dingell asked the Public Oversight Board to conduct a special investiga tion of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audit work for Enron Mr Bowsher said the oversight board wont open a special investigation le aving that to the SEC and the industrys qualitycontrol inquiry committee but will decide at its next meeting whether to take a hard look at recen t highprofile audit blowups Were probably going to want to look at some of these major audit failures and thats not limited to Andersen Mr Bowsher said He cited recent audit failures involving Cendant Corp Microstrategy Inc Sunbeam Corp and Waste Management Inc saying I think we ought to look at them all Former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner expressed disappointment at the ove rsight boards reluctance to exercise its investigative muscle given a ras h of financial restatements and frauds that have cost investors more than billion in recent years In light of losses that have reached the magnitude of the savingsandloan debacle its time for the POB to start carrying out investigations of wha ts happening at the audit firms Mr Turner said He said Rep Dingell is right to question the accounting professions abili ty to police itself through socalled peer reviews saying recent audit fai lures are evidence that the peerreview process is not as robust as it nee ds to be Firms that audit public companies must undergo peer review every three year s subjecting their work to scrutiny by a competing audit firm or a panel a ppointed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants In prac tice the Big Five firms hire each other to conduct the oversight with no requirement to rotate assignments and critics say reviewers arent as toug h as they could or should be Theres a tendency in the peer reviews even when problems are identified to regard them as isolated instances not evidence of a systemic failure at an audit firm said Douglas Carmichael an accounting professor at Baruc h College in New York Mr Bowsher defends peer reviews as a very rigorous thorough process bu t concedes they havent prevented a recent bout of problematic audits He s uggested that may be due to factors from bad judgment on the part of indivi dual partners to questions about applying accounting and auditing standards In Enrons case the qualitycontrol inquiry committee composed of about a dozen CPAs will investigate Andersens audit work but critics doubt it wi ll do much digging BusinessFinancial Desk Section A Employees Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company The rapid decline of the Enron Corporation has devastated its employees re tirement plan which was heavy with company stock and has infuriated worke rs who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunge d Through the k retirement plan employees chose to put much of their sa vings in Enron shares and the company made contributions in company stock as well But around the time Enron disclosed serious financial problems las t month the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrat ive change For several weeks as the stock lost much of its value workers stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated They were not allowed to switch investments at all even though the plan had far less r isky choices The unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for Enrons workers At the end of last year the k plan had billion in assets More than half wa s invested in Enron an energy conglomerate Since then the stock has lost percent of its value At Portland General Electric the Oregon utility acquired by Enron four yea rs ago some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars The utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work throug h their problems We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as or said Steve Lacey an emergencyrepair dispatcher for Portlan d General It pretty much wiped out every employees savings plan Shortly after it was frozen the articles started coming out about some o f the questionable activities of Enron Mr Lacey added The stock took a tremendous drop and we were pretty much helpless The loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on one investment Stock plunges similar to Enrons have also wiped out the re tirement savings of many employees of the Nortel Networks Corporation Luce nt Technologies Inc and Global Crossing Ltd The loss by Enrons workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits ma de by some senior Enron executives who sold stock during the last few year s Enrons chairman Kenneth L Lay made million during the first se ven months of by exercising stock options and more than millio n by exercising options during the three prior years Last week Mr Lay ag reed to forgo a million severance package after Enron traders and emplo yees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed acquisition of the company by Dynegy Inc while they were suffering Enron which is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissi on investigation of transactions among Enron and partnerships headed by the companys former chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow and a number o f shareholders suits now has an additional legal problem On Tuesday Steve W Berman a lawyer from Seattle who represented states a gainst the tobacco industry filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in H ouston seeking classaction status on behalf of Enron employees who lost mo ney on the stock through their retirement plan The lawsuit says that Enron schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fi duciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests They were promoting Enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching employees contributions with Enron stock when they knew the stock was ov ervalued and thats a breach of their fiduciary duties Mr Berman said in an interview yesterday Whats more he said the assets were frozen on Oct with the stock at even though Enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosur es about the companys accounting practices They knew the worst news was about to come out but they froze the stock he said Enron closed yesterday at The company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pendi ng litigation A spokeswoman Karen Denne said that the change in plan adm inistrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did n ot know the exact date the change was put into effect Like many other big companies Enron made its contributions to the plan in company shares But employees also chose to put much of their own contribut ions into the stock lured by its stellar past performance The company say s that percent of the Enron stock in the plan wound up there because emp loyees chose it and percent was the companys contribution A lot of people believed in the stock so it wasnt just the company matc h said an employee at Enrons headquarters in downtown Houston It was their own money too People are just shellshocked The stocks past performance had lured many workers Last year as the stoc k soared total assets in the k plan rose more than percent About percent of Enrons employees participate in the k plan The company generally matches employee contributions at cents on the d ollar up to percent of their salary with Enron stock which cannot be s old and put into another investment until the employee reaches age But Ms Denne said workers otherwise have a range of options in which to in vest their money Gerry OConnor a senior consultant with the Spectrem Group a consulting f irm based in Chicago said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze asse ts when administrators were switched If you dont you can wind up with misallocated money wrong statements and all kinds of complicating factors he said But a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many specialists in retirement planning Employees are taking a lot of risk b ut they dont think of it as such Mr OConnor said They say You know I work for this company and were doing great In addition to the swoon in their k plans Enron employees have watche d the value of their stock options wither Enron gave a far larger percenta ge of employees options than most companies do but now with the fall in E nron shares nearly all of those options are worthless Enrons tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its wo rkers in Oregon About percent of the employees of Portland Genera l which Enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash are invested in the k plan said Scott Simms a spokesman The losses he added have hit everyone including officers all the way th rough to other staff Its certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and others havent he said It was the same plan for everyone In an interview with The Oregonian in Portland Peggy Y Fowler Portland G enerals chief executive said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincide nce The timing couldnt have been worse she said We refer to our retirement program as a threelegged stool Social Secu rity the company pension and the k Ms Fowler said One of the l egs has been cut off BusinessFinancial Desk Section C Circling the Wagons Around Enron Risks Too Great To Let Trader Just Die By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D ATLAS The New

Enrons Transwestern Pipeline which links natural gas fields in Texas to the California market they said The deals would be structured like Dynegys agreement as part of the merger to infu se billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Ga s pipeline That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merg er falls apart Besides talking with other potential investors J P

traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange cl osing at down That means the premium that Dynegy would be pay ing for Enron has risen to percent Analysts following Enrons debt said that bankers had little choice but to support the company given that most of Enrons bank debt is not secured T hat means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy they would receive no better treatment than the holders of more than billion in Enron bonds and other debt Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure billion in deb t that will come due by the end of If the Dynegy deal closed that would be the best thing for the banks said one analyst following the deb t James B Lee Jr vice chairman of J P Morgan Chase echoed that thought in a statement issued by Enron We believe the interests of

position up to and through its merger w ith Dynegy Along with Citigroup J P Morgan Chase is Enrons lead bank and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink the big creditrat ing agencies continued to step gingerly The agencies have held Enrons de bt rating one step above junk status knowing that downgrading it furth er would force the

in the nation s energy markets While Enron has been the nations biggest trader of elect ric power and natural gas many other companies including Dynegy make markets in those commodities Analysts say

pumping every dime he could into his k plan at work and getting a dollarfordollar match And the money was p iling up in the years he worked there Earlier this year Rinard had in his k plan Today its wort h about Thats because Rinard is a lineman with Enronowned Portland General Electr ic in Portland Ore In January Enron was trading for Wednesday it closed at a sh are Part of the reason that Rinard lost so much money is that Enron gives its e mployees their k match in company stock That was great when the stock was flying high but as the stock has tanked employee retirement accounts have evaporated Its fairly common for employers to give their k match in their own co mpany stock said Scott Alt assistant vice president of Aon Consulting a human resources consulting firm in Houston Its often cheaper for a company to provide stock because they dont have t o put out the cash said Alt who sets up k plans for companies And giving stock makes the employees shareholders which many executives be lieves breed loyalty They work a little harder when they own the company Alt said And employees like it except of course if the stock plummets At Enron the problem was compounded when many employees including Rinard saw Enrons stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire acco unt into Enron stock Enron executives were talking about how the stock price was poised to climb above a share he recalled It was going to Rinard and a coworker Steve Lacey have filed an Employee Retirement Inco me Security Act or ERISA lawsuit in Houston contending that Enron reckles sly endangered their retirement funds Steve Berman managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock Enron officials didnt emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive especially when things were going downhill said Berman who is hoping to get the suit certified as a classaction case Hes hoping to prove that the k plan executives failed to act responsi bly when they knew about serious business problems Berman is hoping to break some new legal ground with his case Its pattern ed after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their k contributions with com pany stock that later tanked That case is still in litigation Another troubling feature of the Enron k plan was that employees were not allowed to make trades for about a month Unfortunately the lockdown b egan Oct the day after Enron surprised the market that it was taking a billion aftertax thirdquarter charge to get out of bad investments Enron officials who did not return a telephone call for this column have said they had planned the lockdown for several months because it was changi ng plan administrators But that timing was disastrous for Rinard and his coworkers who couldnt s ell their shares between the time it was a share on Oct and when they could begin to trade again at less than a share I just watched it drop horrified Rinard said There wasnt a thing I c ould do about it Like many employees Rinards k retirement fund was the only thing he had And now Rinard is kicking himself for trusting his company too much Before the wheels came off the wagon retirement was a doable thing Rinard said The end was

Micha el S Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York But its a bad limp There were no major new disclosures to prompt Wednesdays selloff but inv estors seemed to be afraid to hold Enron stock over the Thanksgiving weeken d traders said The stock market is closed today and open Friday for an ab breviated sessiontraditionally the lightest trading day of the year Enron shares plummeted on Tuesday in reaction to a filing Monday with t he Securities and Exchange Commission in which Enron disclosed the mil lion obligation The disclosure was a surprise even to the credit rating ag encies that have been in constant contact with Enron executives since the c ompanys finances began unraveling last month The rating agencies view is critical because under some controversial Enr on deals that have come to light recently a downgrade to junk level would be a trigger event requiring Enron to immediately pay billion to cre ditors the company said in Mondays SEC filing Such an event could instantly bankrupt the company analysts said Enron has been reeling since midOctober when it began disclosing details of deals involving limited partnerships organized by current or former comp any executives The partnerships purpose appears partly to have been to pu mp up Enrons reported profit while concealing large amounts of debt it was incurring The SEC has announced that it is investigating the situation In addition to announcing the delayed payment Enron said Wednesday that it had tapped the remaining million of a previously announced billion credit line from its chief lenders JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc Enron probably can restructure its debts and postpone most payments until M ay analyst Ronald M Barone of Standard Poors rating agency said Wednes day It is in the lenders

article which mentions Enron and the to change Oil industry has fingers crossed over YK bug By Richard Valdmanis NEW YORK Nov Reuters Despite some glowing reports on YK readiness in the US oil and gas industry private analysts and even some of the more forthcoming oil companies say there is no way to know whether the computer glitch will result in fuel shortages to consumers After all the research thats been done and all the data thats been collected we dont really know what will happen when the clock strikes on New Years Eve said Dr Martin Weiss Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc which has been tracking YK compliance among major US companies for more than a year The YK bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake for For the energy industry which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems the YK bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for YK a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly percent reported a year ago some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises They point out that the YK situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all noncompliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth Enron Corp ENEN a major US petroleum company and pipeline operator is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring Despite their best efforts to upgrade their mission critical systems those that are essential to their business the company says there is no assurance that our YK plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all noncompliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a cascading effect of system failures The problem is not and will not be unique to Enron the company added Though Enron has not announced any precautionary YK shutdowns a number of other major US pipeline operators have For example the Colonial Pipeline the largest in the nation plans an eighthour shutdown starting on New Years Eve Explorer Pipeline the second largest plans a hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston New York and Chicago In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal day inventories according to industry and government officials The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at US refineries which produce the gasoline By most accounts refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out YK problems According to Weiss Rating Co the majority of large US oil refining companies like Exxon Corp XONN and Mobil Corp MOBN are either average or above average in their adherance to YK plans mapped out more than a year ago and only a handful like Chevron Corp CHVN and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp UDSN are rated below average While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry refiners seem to be the more prepared said Dr Weiss Over all the energy sector appears to be taking the YK problem seriously but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a nonevent According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute API the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups nearly percent of the nations refiners retailers and pipeline operators will be ready for the year turnover which comes in less than two months by having YK proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down What the reports are saying is the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be YK ready and thats encouraging said an official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC But obviously nobody can make any guarantees REUTERS Rtr

resources and reserves for electricity will be megawatts short of the anticipated load in California Independent System Operator ISO President and CEO Terry Winter said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting Im concerned about supply Winter said Without sufficient supply markets will set socially and politically unacceptable price levels for wholesale power Winter said California power resources will total Mw in but load is expected to reach well over Mw Over Mw of new generation is planned for the state but most new power plants are not expected to begin service until and beyond Not helping Californias cause Winter said are reduced imports of power this year from neighboring states down from Mw in November of to Mw this November Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market You can build generation but in California natural gas and emissions are the next problems Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity hasthere is a shortage Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed since May leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series of conservation emergencies since that time The state has been under a power conservation warning much of this week As tools to solve California power woes Winter suggested the ISO file for an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated to be workably competitive The ISOs authority to set price caps which currently stands at per Mwhour expired Nov The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Nov proposed caps of Mwhour but has yet to officially rule on the matter Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load End California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity Supply Crisis FOLSOM CalifBUSINESS WIREDec via NewsEdge Corporation While grappling with another Stage Two Emergency today the California Independent System Operator California ISO is taking swift action to deal with a critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets The proposed market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy which is in short supply throughout the western United States This afternoon the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Commencing at pm today Friday December the California ISO will implement a soft cap on the ISOs RealTime Energy Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November Order Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets FERC Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC Energy bids prices in excess of MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISOs computerized scheduling system but instead will be evaluated in price merit order The California ISO has recently been placed in the position of having to negotiate prices for power in realtime and is finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while at the same time balancing supply and demand causing significant risk to the California ISOs ability to maintain reliable control of the power grid The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in realtime To the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators market participants for energy bid prices in excess of the soft cap then settlement will be asbid subject to refund if the costs cannot be verified Market participants will be required to submit cost documentation to the FERC with informational filings to the ISO and the state supporting any Energy payments priced in excess of the soft cap The current price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is unaffected Also the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to the soft cap Amendment proposes three key elements Implement a soft cap of MWh for Imbalance Energy This soft cap would limit market clearing prices to MWh but would allow market participants to submit bids over if they submit verifiable costs Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISOs realtime energy purchases to meet their loads rather than buying their own supplies in the forward markets and Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to comply with ISO dispatch instructions Amendment is posted on the ISOs website at wwwcaisocom under FERC FILINGS on the home page The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it buys in real time For the first five days of December we averaged approximately million per day However on December th we paid million December th million Failure to take action now would have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to face these extraordinary costs The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along the longdistance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system The notforprofit publicbenefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March when California opened its energy markets to competition and the states investorowned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a circuit mile electron highway Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand PORTLAND Ore Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Due to an impending power shortage federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for generation from upstream reservoirs the Bonneville Power Administration said today The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air invades the Northwest beginning this weekend The team comprises Northwest utilities the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the four Northwest states BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the Cascades BPA supplies about percent of the regions electricity most of it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency status Delwiche said The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon BPA manages the storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical generating requirements and flows for salmon BPA has the authority to exceed guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions It is very important that everyone residential and commercial consumers and industries do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity during this cold snap said Greg Delwiche BPAs vice president for generation supply Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw water from the reservoirs SOURCE Bonneville Power Administration CONTACT Ed Mosey Bonneville Power Administration Web site Calif Restarts Dirty Power Plants By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP via NewsEdge Corporation Hoping to ease the states electricity crisis airquality regulators Friday allowed the restart of several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down because they had reached air pollution limits The move came a day after California encountered an unprecedented power crunch with electricity supplies for the states million people so perilously low that California only narrowly avoided blackouts The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the Northwest the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in California On Thursday during the emergency power plants capable of producing megawatts were offline because they had exceeded their pollution limits One megawatt is sufficient to power about homes On Friday the South Coast Air Quality Management District agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity However those plants will have to pay daily fines Restarting the overpolluting plants should provide a cushion for state said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid In addition hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption Friday to avoid imposed outages Were still encouraging conservation efforts said Lori ODonley spokeswoman for the ISO Were optimistic that we wont have to impose shutdowns on commercial customers Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find power that can be diverted to California during the crunch moves that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of state The power grids managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push water from Northern California to central and southern regions The phasedin deregulation of Californias billion electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand for electricity has outstripped supply in part because of a growing population and a booming hightech economy Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies held off building new power plants while deregulation was in

San Diego Gas Electric And El Paso Natural Gas LOS ANGELES Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles against Southern California Gas Company San Diego Gas amp Electric Company Sempra Energy parent of the two utilities El Paso Natural Gas Co and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices The complaints summarize the issue as follows This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering Californias electrical system and threatening Californias economy It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history Southern Californias current energy crisis is not simply the result of everincreasing demand by a growing population for energy Rather it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industrys most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity As a result Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages Para and of complaint In September of top executives of Southern California Gas Company SoCal Gas San Diego Gas amp Electric SDGampE and El Paso Natural Gas Corporation EPNG met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix Arizona Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets The conspirators sought to eliminate competition take advantage of electric deregulation drive up the price of natural gas and profit from the increased prices Para of complaint One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices the other deals with the effects on electricity prices The price of gasfired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat PDF files on the web site of the law firm of ODonnell and Shaeffer at osnews Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews and can also provide additional materials including copies of the agenda prepared for the secret meeting as well as graphics illustrating the location of natural gas pipelines that were planned but then terminated by the defendants following the secret meeting in Phoenix For more information contact Pierce ODonnell or Carole E Handler ODonnell amp

Stem Rising Power Prices BOULDER Colo Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation With electricity prices rising like floodwaters in California and other states limited generation capacity has garnered the most attention as the culprit Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down However E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads We found that larger customers could offer almost percent of their load as negawatts temporary reductions in electricity demand says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices dont immediately affect end users prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight But if demand dropped in response to high prices LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower He explains Although theres a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today weve uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market Unfortunately most of them dont yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible They also havent been offered a pricing product they like The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis as just one example So how many negawatts are available According to the E SOURCE national market survey mediumtolarge commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by percent if offered a market price of per kWh one of the tested price points for reduced electricity usage At this price which incidentally is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December in wholesale power markets about MW could be made available across the US and about MW in California LeBlanc adds We cant expect to capture all of this potential But with the right product pricing scheme and marketing it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system The E SOURCE study Energy Pricing and Load Management What Do EndUsers Want can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs Its based on an extensive research with over energy decisionmakers across the US and Canada For further information about Energy Pricing and Load Management please call Bill LeBlanc at or Tia Hensler market research director at SOURCE E SOURCE CONTACT Bill LeBlanc or Tia Hensler

loss on our debts Have we had any such conversations w him I told the media yesterday we hadnt been contacted by him Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on AM From Ann M Schmidt on AM To Karen NRON cc Subject Merrill Lynch Report Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street Karen FYI Ann Governor Davis Comes to Wall Street New York M E R R I L L L Y N C H Research Bulletin Fixed Income Research Reference Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

bitter campaigns to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public Pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back To Freeman who has resigned as general manager of the LA Department of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov Gray Davis it seems Riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer California out of the energy crisis So the mayor Freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment With all due respect I have years of experience and knowledgeand he has days Freeman said But hes the mayor and he didnt like it that I didnt just say yes to everything he came up with To Riordan Freemans efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles The mayor said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis And he scoffed at Freeman for saying he had lifted morale at DWP Morale was terrible under him Riordan said I mean they are so relieved right now The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud successful men unable to say I couldnt have done it without X Y and Z Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings And the mayor a Republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with Freeman a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Southern drawl In an interview after his resignation Freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor One of his concerns Freeman said was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agencys progress in protecting the environment Freeman cited Riordans plans concerning coalfired power plants in Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP the nations largest municipal utility The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the Grand Canyon The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale He described the mayors move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees DWP were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the West Ive worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the DWP policy Freeman said And I am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress weve made The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central Utah Riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause In both cases Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los Angeles at an affordable cost By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and expanding the Utah plant Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow Riordan said Natural gas which provides of the fuel for DWP plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides The rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power providers I favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where were going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles Riordan said On the Mohave plant Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the citys share to a buyer that would simply continue running it Its still going to be coaldriven he said How does selling it help the environment The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how LA has dodged the crisis Riordan and the DWP commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches Freeman said The conflict reached its peak on April the day Freeman resigned to become the governors advisor The DWP board president Kenneth T Lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately All we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us Lombard said From Riordans standpoint Freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest The city utility sells surplus power to the state so Freeman would be on both sides of the sales Freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees In an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what Ive accomplished here he said Brian DArcy who heads the union local that represents DWP employees agreed that Riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky DArcy said Riordan said Freeman deserves an Aplus for his work at DWP The mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done to hurt Los Angeles But he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP not just by the mayor but by the agencys board and the City Council In he called for City Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors The proposal went nowhere Freemans concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday The Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP It calls for restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed But Riordan and Galanter who chairs the Councils Commerce Energy and Natural Resources Committee rejected the concept Copyright Los Angeles Times

Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy Copyright Dow Jones

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

resources and reserves for electricity will be megawatts short of the anticipated load in California Independent System Operator ISO President and CEO Terry Winter said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting Im concerned about supply Winter said Without sufficient supply markets will set socially and politically unacceptable price levels for wholesale power Winter said California power resources will total Mw in but load is expected to reach well over Mw Over Mw of new generation is planned for the state but most new power plants are not expected to begin service until and beyond Not helping Californias cause Winter said are reduced imports of power this year from neighboring states down from Mw in November of to Mw this November Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market You can build generation but in California natural gas and emissions are the next problems Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity hasthere is a shortage Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed since May leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series of conservation emergencies since that time The state has been under a power conservation warning much of this week As tools to solve California power woes Winter suggested the ISO file for an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated to be workably competitive The ISOs authority to set price caps which currently stands at per Mwhour expired Nov The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Nov proposed caps of Mwhour but has yet to officially rule on the matter Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load End California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity Supply Crisis FOLSOM CalifBUSINESS WIREDec via NewsEdge Corporation While grappling with another Stage Two Emergency today the California Independent System Operator California ISO is taking swift action to deal with a critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets The proposed market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy which is in short supply throughout the western United States This afternoon the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Commencing at pm today Friday December the California ISO will implement a soft cap on the ISOs RealTime Energy Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November Order Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets FERC Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC Energy bids prices in excess of MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISOs computerized scheduling system but instead will be evaluated in price merit order The California ISO has recently been placed in the position of having to negotiate prices for power in realtime and is finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while at the same time balancing supply and demand causing significant risk to the California ISOs ability to maintain reliable control of the power grid The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in realtime To the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators market participants for energy bid prices in excess of the soft cap then settlement will be asbid subject to refund if the costs cannot be verified Market participants will be required to submit cost documentation to the FERC with informational filings to the ISO and the state supporting any Energy payments priced in excess of the soft cap The current price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is unaffected Also the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to the soft cap Amendment proposes three key elements Implement a soft cap of MWh for Imbalance Energy This soft cap would limit market clearing prices to MWh but would allow market participants to submit bids over if they submit verifiable costs Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISOs realtime energy purchases to meet their loads rather than buying their own supplies in the forward markets and Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to comply with ISO dispatch instructions Amendment is posted on the ISOs website at wwwcaisocom under FERC FILINGS on the home page The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it buys in real time For the first five days of December we averaged approximately million per day However on December th we paid million December th million Failure to take action now would have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to face these extraordinary costs The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along the longdistance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system The notforprofit publicbenefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March when California opened its energy markets to competition and the states investorowned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a circuit mile electron highway Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand PORTLAND Ore Dec PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation Due to an impending power shortage federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for generation from upstream reservoirs the Bonneville Power Administration said today The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air invades the Northwest beginning this weekend The team comprises Northwest utilities the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the four Northwest states BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the Cascades BPA supplies about percent of the regions electricity most of it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency status Delwiche said The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon BPA manages the storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical generating requirements and flows for salmon BPA has the authority to exceed guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions It is very important that everyone residential and commercial consumers and industries do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity during this cold snap said Greg Delwiche BPAs vice president for generation supply Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw water from the reservoirs SOURCE Bonneville Power Administration CONTACT Ed Mosey Bonneville Power Administration Web site Calif Restarts Dirty Power Plants By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP via NewsEdge Corporation Hoping to ease the states electricity crisis airquality regulators Friday allowed the restart of several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down because they had reached air pollution limits The move came a day after California encountered an unprecedented power crunch with electricity supplies for the states million people so perilously low that California only narrowly avoided blackouts The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the Northwest the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in California On Thursday during the emergency power plants capable of producing megawatts were offline because they had exceeded their pollution limits One megawatt is sufficient to power about homes On Friday the South Coast Air Quality Management District agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity However those plants will have to pay daily fines Restarting the overpolluting plants should provide a cushion for state said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid In addition hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption Friday to avoid imposed outages Were still encouraging conservation efforts said Lori ODonley spokeswoman for the ISO Were optimistic that we wont have to impose shutdowns on commercial customers Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find power that can be diverted to California during the crunch moves that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of state The power grids managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push water from Northern California to central and southern regions The phasedin deregulation of Californias billion electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand for electricity has outstripped supply in part because of a growing population and a booming hightech economy Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the planning stages In addition deregulation has forced utilities to sell off their powergenerating assets such as dams and plants and import electricity from neighboring states where power demand is high right now because of a cold snap

Subject FYI In case you missed it heres a transcript from Floyds appearance this afternoon on CNNfn Also for what its worth our view is that you have nothing to lose by putting out the word that youve got a day extension on the million It buys a little time if nothing else Please let us know what else we can do to help CNNfnSTREETSWEEP Enron Analysis CNNfn THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED CHRISTINE ROMANS CNNfn ANCHOR STREET SWEEP Shares of Enron Company Enron Corporation Ticker ENE URL losing steam again today The stock closing down at cents a share A nearly year low Investors apparently concerned about a potential cash crunch at the embattled energy firm Joining us with more on Enrons troubles is Floyd Norris financial editor with The New York Times Welcome to the program FLOYD NORRIS FINANCIAL EDITOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Thank you ROMANS This has been a fascinating story and stock to watch develop First off what is the latest that drove this stock down more than percent again today NORRIS Well yesterday after the close they filed a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission and as people studied it overnight they were quite surprised And it got worse this morning They disclosed that they have million in debt So they may have to pay next week if they cant either come up with collateral which will not be easy or persuade the lenders to renegotiate And what was shocking about that wasnt that the debt existed that was known it was that they had to pay it so quickly It turns out according to what people are telling analysts that Dynegy Company Dynegy Inc Ticker DYN URL which agreed to buy them only a week or two ago didnt know about this They had not told them apparently Enron didnt realize they had this problem ROMANS OK wait There seems to be a lot of things that Wall Street didnt know was going on And every sort of revelation is a big blow to the stock Who is watching whats happening here and how can there be so many surprises Thats confusing to a lot of folks who are following this NORRIS Well itsthe fact Wall Street is surprised isnt necessarily surprising but the fact that Enron seems to have been surprised is surprising Theyve had a lot of turnover It reinforces the suspicion that Jeff Skilling the chief executive officer who quit in midyear and perhaps the treasury and chief financial officer both of whom were ousted within the last month as this crisis grew may have been the only people who really understood what was going on there and that makes you wonder what else might yet come out ROMANS Well what about auditors and what about the board governing this firm And what about Ken Lay I mean he is sort of the statesman of the industry isnt he and hes running this company again NORRIS Well hes back running the company The suspicion is and Lay denies it he says he knows whats going on my suspicion is that he didnt know the details He trusted He understood the company was overvalued probably This is a man who was taking out hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock exercising stock options and selling stock But I suspect he didnt understand all of the details and now they are coming back to haunt him The other thing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the company is burning through cash at an amazing rate And Enron has not really given us a good understanding of why they are burning through the cash that fast But it raises questions about whether the company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken over by Dynegy by next September And of course the way the stock is trading its obvious that a lot of people on Wall Street doubt that deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through on the announced terms TRACY EICHLER UBS PAINEWEBBER Floyd my question regarding shareholder lawsuits It seems like theres some validity there Any new news on the SEC investigation and the magnitude to those lawsuits NORRIS Theres no news on the SEC investigation There are of course huge shareholder lawsuits Theyre filed against Enron theyre filed against the current and former officers of the company And theyre filed against Arthur Andersen which audited this company The accounting regulators are already starting to check in again on Arthur Andersen which used to be the class of the accounting business and has had a string of recent embarrassments ROMANS All right Floyd Norris for The New York Times thank you so much for joining us NORRIS Thank you TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT PLEASE

Press All Rights Reserved HOUSTON AP After Enron Corp tapped into more than billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers stock prices dropped Enron Corps stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday Shares fell cents on Friday to a level not seen since as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the companys earnings announcement earlier this month The stock is down more than percent in two weeks and the company lost almost billion in market value Late this week the company decided to convert billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash The company put about billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of shortterm corporate IOU known as commercial paper Nothing spells confidence quite like cash which is what we want investors to understand said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the billion banked this week Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as good management decisions On Oct Enrons thirdquarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about ThenChief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow with the Enron boards approval had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest The partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in shareholder equity new questions began to arise The Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence Reducing the companys debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools like a revolving line of credit could give great peace of mind to Enrons investors said Anatol Feygin an analyst with JP Morgan It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business which is really the core of their operations Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturdays editions Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities still sees the move as somewhat confusing Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange mixed message she said Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back Is it a gesture for customers It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management BARRONS REVIEW PREVIEW Capital Markets Report Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Turning Up the Heat Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO Andrew S Fastow Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence Enron shares have plunged recently after it announced the probe and reported a million loss BARRONS The Trader Dow Jones Commodities Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Bulls Look To Recovery As Techs Lead The Surge By Andrew Barry In what undoubtedly will become a businessschool case study Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a fullblown financial crisis last week Enrons stock plunged to following a point drop in the prior week and the companys bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around By weeks end Enron had drawn down billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly billion in maturing commercial paper leaving it only about billion of net liquidity Enrons big energy trading operation which accounts for the bulk of the companys profits and most of its equity valuation now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies but the company is likely to remain an investmentgrade credit Moodys Investors Service now rates its debt Baa three notches above junk One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades concerned about Enrons viability push for settlement of the trades precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed LongTerm Capital Management in Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation Enron has resisted refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enroncreated partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly billion loss on that deal Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the companys credit ratings There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets including its moneylosing broadband business Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its secondquarter book value of a share but its worth noting that tangible book excluding goodwill was only a share Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enrons billion asset writedown and its stillmysterious billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships The thirdquarter book value wont be known until Enron releases its balance sheet which may not occur until its quarterly Q is released The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didnt demand it The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the companys leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts confidence in management The Street really didnt provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a billion valuation That value has since shrunk to billion Enrons woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets Until last week Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enrons financial health Enron had about billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed offbalancesheet debt Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years Judging from the companys rather meager credit lines Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets City Enron directors cash in shares By Simon English The Daily Telegraph P c Telegraph Group Limited London LEADING executives at Enron the troubled US energy giant cashed in shares worth more than m m this year in the runup to a financial crunch that has left the companys credibility in ruins Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay chief executive sold about shares this year netting him more than m He still held m shares until July Other executives made similar sales a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from at the start of the year to by July They halved again this week and fell to below yesterday Enron declined to comment on the share sales Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to dispel uncertainty in the financial community by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enrons financial strength Enron will pay off debts of billion and keep another in cash He said We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow former chief financial officer

a way to offset risks associated with some of the companys newer businesses such as broadband trading Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in shareholder equity new questions began to arise Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected but The Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence In drawing down the billion line of revolving credit this week the company put about billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer and often with more flexible terms Investors in commercial paper who are actually more like lenders since its actually a form of debt are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of shortterm investments The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit To some extent redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets which look at it negatively said Anatol Feygin an analyst with JP Morgan But reducing the companys debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools like a revolving line of credit could give great peace of mind to Enrons investors he said It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business which is really the core of their operations Feygin said Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities still sees the move as somewhat confusing Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange mixed message she said Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back Is it a gesture for customers It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management Jeff Dietert an analyst at Simmons Co said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned In a worstcase scenario investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron That could lead to lower credit ratings which would force Enrons energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it Thus we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues Dietert wrote in a report Friday Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store For example a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco It was formed in with about million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets Chewco was run by Michael Kopper a managing director of Enrons Global Equity Markets Group Frankly that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity Feygin said Until now everything thats come out Ive at least heard of or had some idea of what they were from the companys filings or discussions This is something I had never heard of before MONEYSENSE BUSINESS BRIEFS

Corporation trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday using billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than billion in cash The moves did not appear to reassure investors as Enrons share price fell to another sixyear low Shares traded as low as yesterday before ending the day at down cents The move will raise the interest expense for the company because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional billion Enrons debt is rated investment grade But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default But with the bonds trading so low it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper Enrons stock has been

article which mentions Enron and the to change Oil industry has fingers crossed over YK bug By Richard Valdmanis NEW YORK Nov Reuters Despite some glowing reports on YK readiness in the US oil and gas industry private analysts and even some of the more forthcoming oil companies say there is no way to know whether the computer glitch will result in fuel shortages to consumers After all the research thats been done and all the data thats been collected we dont really know what will happen when the clock strikes on New Years Eve said Dr Martin Weiss Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc which has been tracking YK compliance among major US companies for more than a year The YK bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake for For the energy industry which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems the YK bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for YK a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly percent reported a year ago some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises They point out that the YK situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all noncompliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth Enron Corp ENEN a major US petroleum company and pipeline operator is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring Despite their best efforts to upgrade their mission critical systems those that are essential to their business the company says there is no assurance that our YK plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all noncompliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a cascading effect of system failures The problem is not and will not be unique to Enron the company added Though Enron has not announced any precautionary YK shutdowns a number of other major US pipeline operators have For example the Colonial Pipeline the largest in the nation plans an eighthour shutdown starting on New Years Eve Explorer Pipeline the second largest plans a hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston New York and Chicago In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal day inventories according to industry and government officials The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at US refineries which produce the gasoline By most accounts refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out YK problems According to Weiss Rating Co the majority of large US oil refining companies like Exxon Corp XONN and Mobil Corp MOBN are either average or above average in their adherance to YK plans mapped out more than a year ago and only a handful like Chevron Corp CHVN and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp UDSN are rated below average While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry refiners seem to be the more prepared said Dr Weiss Over all the energy sector appears to be taking the YK problem seriously but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a nonevent According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute API the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups nearly percent of the nations refiners retailers and pipeline operators will be ready for the year turnover which comes in less than two months by having YK proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down What the reports are saying is the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be YK ready and thats encouraging said an official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC But obviously nobody can make any guarantees REUTERS Rtr

initial coverage BusinessFinancial Desk Section A Rival to Buy Enron Top Energy Trader After Financial Fall By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company With its stock plunging and its finances in doubt the worlds largest ener gy trader the Enron Corporation agreed to be acquired yesterday by the ri val Dynegy Inc for about billion in stock and the assumption of bil lion in debt The deal is an extraordinary turnabout for Enron a Houstonbased company t hat had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide Its chairman Kenneth L Lay a big contributor to the Republican Party pr ovided political influence while its former chief executive Jeffrey K Sk illing helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural ga s But last winter when Californias effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts Enron was the sub ject of much criticism and political anger Recent disclosures of discrepancies in Enrons financial statements and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused the shares t o plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade As other companies be came wary of doing business with it Enron also facing a potential cash squeeze apparently had little choice but to find a buyer and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week For critics who had complained about Enrons market power and its dominance the combination poses additional concerns Dynegys acquisition of Enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies led by the Justice Departme nt and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Analysts said today that t hey expected scrutiny of the combined companies holdings in California wh ere Dynegy owns powergenerating plants and Enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas fuel for the states electric power plants Buying Enron at a deep discount it has lost billion in market value this year could make Dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natur al gas But the agreement carries big risks as well Along with Enrons gas pipelines and hightechnology trading floor Dynegy will take on Enrons s ubstantial debt and a web of complex transactions that Enron has spun over the last decade In addition to the billion in debt that Enron carries on its books it has guaranteed at least billion in offbalance sheet loans and the hidd en debt could total as much as billion said Carol Coale a stock analy st with Prudential Securities Charles L Watson Dynegys chairman and chief executive said yesterday th at Dynegy could sort through Enrons tangled finances We know the compan y well Mr Watson said Its not like we just started fresh Im confi dent that its as solid as we thought it was The new company will combine Enrons mile natural gas pipeline syste m with the large number of power plants that Dynegy owns worldwide as well as Illinois Power a Dynegy subsidiary that serves customers in Il linois But its most important asset will be its trading desk It will be t he largest energy trader in the nation trading more than twice as much pow er and natural gas as its closest competitors Mr Watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties a nd that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny Theres really not a lo t of overlap in assets he said Mr Watson and Steve Bergstrom Dynegys president will hold those positio ns in the new company which will be called Dynegy and remain in Houston M r Lay who created Enron in the mids will not have any role in the combined companys daily operations He has been asked to join its board bu t has not provided an answer The last three weeks havent been a lot of fun he said In a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon Mr Watson sai d he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company En ron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy Mr Watson said We will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities To shore up Enrons finances Dynegy will immediately put billion into Enron through ChevronTexaco the giant oil company which already owns percent of Dynegy Another billion dollars will be injected once the deal i s completed Investors appeared comfortable yesterday that Dynegy could make the deal wo rk After falling to on Wednesday when the companies first said t hey were in discussions Dynegy rose on Thursday and yesterday to clo se the week at On paper it works Ms Coale of Prudential said The combined compan y would be the leading trader the market leader in most of their businesse s Ms Coale who has a sell rating on Enron and a buy rating on Dynegy said she planned to keep her buy rating on Dynegy As it works to have the deal approved Dynegy will have to persuade Enrons traders to stay with the combined company The pain of the stocks perc ent plunge this year will not be equally shared Some Enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated Mean while Mr Lay Mr Skilling and other former and current executives sold h undreds of millions of dollars in Enron stock in and this year The companies also have very different corporate cultures Dynegy emphasize s teamwork while Enron is more competitive said Ehud Ronn director of th e Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the University of Tex as Even before the merger was announced Enron had lost some of its employ ees to other energy trading companies Mr Ronn said Some investors and analysts say that the problems with Enrons finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of Wall Streets scrutiny the last month James Chanos a shortseller who has been one of Enrons most vocal critics said there was increasing evidence that Enrons energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said There appears to be a culture at Enron of aggressively booking profits an d deferring or obscuring losses Mr Chanos said On Thursday Enron said in a filing with the SEC that it had overstated i ts earnings by almost million over the last five years Mr Chanos sai d more restatements were possible noting that the filing disclosed partner ships had been used to hedge almost billion in losses in and this y ear So far the losses from those partnerships remain off Enrons financia l statements Mr Chanos said Enrons stock had been under pressure for most of this year as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation In August Mr Skilling resigned as chief executive and Mr La y resumed control of daily operations Still the company appeared financially sound until last month when it dis closed that its shareholders equity a measure of the companys value dro pped by billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financia l statements The announcement unnerved investors who wondered whether Enr on had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance shee t and led the SEC to begin an investigation Mr Lay tried to reassure investors that Enrons finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong But the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that Enron formed with some of its top executives including its former chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow With questions mounting the major creditrating agencies began to downgrad e Enrons debt putting additional pressure on the company If Enrons debt rating falls below investment grade it would be forced to repay bill ion in loans that it had guaranteed To strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock Enron turned to big investors like Warren E Buffett in search of billions of dollars of financ ing When the financing did not quickly appear its stock fell further By this week some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to E nron worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contrac ts The Mirant Corporation an Atlantabased power plant owner and electric ity trader sharply curtailed its trading with Enron this week Were tra ding with them on

WASHINGTON Nov For years the Enron Corporation used its political m uscle to build the markets in which it thrived pushing relentlessly on Cap itol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nations natural gas and electricity businesses Its achievement as one Enron executive said today in creating a regulat ory black hole fit nicely with what he called the companys core manage ment philosophy which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency Now Wall Streets dissatisfaction with Enrons secretive ways has delivere d the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival Dynegy Inc in a deal worth about billion in stock and the assumption of billio n in debt The combination of the two companies energy experts and lawmake rs said today poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggl ing to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented Were in a supersonicspeed era of electronic trading with a horseandbu ggyera regulatory system to protect consumers said Representative Edwar d J Markey a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap Dynegys acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies led by the Justice Department the Federal Trade Comm ission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined comp anies holdings in California where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enro n controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas the fuel f or a big share of the states electric power plants Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity said Frank Wolak a professor of economics at Stanford University Mr Wolak a consultant to the Justice Department on a antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas compani es in Southern California said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing todays deal The transaction is something the Department of Justice needs to look at and they are going to have a hard time looking at Mr Wolak said And its beyond the ability of the FERC to look at Pat Wood named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this ye ar with the backing of Kenneth L Lay the chairman of Enron acknowledge d in an interview today that the agency had a long way to go in matchin g the sophistication of the companies it regulates But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with th e new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron Dynegy and other energ y companies It is hiring more experts he said adopting more restrictive rules on how much market power one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions In an interview this evening Charles L Watson the chairman of Dynegy sa id he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would r equire the sale of any assets We havent really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture he said Theres not really any overlap A senior executive at one of Enrons largest energytrading rivals disagree d I dont think this deal gets through unscathed he said today Im sure the Justice Department and the FTC will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energytrading area Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity indeed the bigg est player in both those markets and it also owns a network of gas pipel ines Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electr icity Each company owns a local electric utility too Dynegy owns Illinoi s Power in Decatur Ill while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Por tland Ore but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon ut ility For a decade as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into th e nations biggest energy trader Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street In the early months of the Bush administration Mr Lay whose company wa s one of the biggest financial backers of George W Bushs presidential cam paign played a prominent and some said unusual role in helping the Whi te House pick nominees to the federal energy commission Enron executives m et with Vice President Dick Cheney whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr Lay Now the company has become a pariah an Enron executive said today The Bush administration doesnt want to have anything to do with us The problems began with the energy crisis in California where Enrons outs poken defense of deregulation even more than its electricity trading activ ities made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates In the financial markets meanwhile Enrons confusing disclosu res tolerated when its stock was soaring drew disdain as the calming of t he energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shar es down starting last spring Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency Mr Wol ak said As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control he said Enrons view was that we want everybody s data but if you want ours get a subpoena Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marke d Enrons attitude about government oversight Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their s ervice areas A few entrepreneurs led by Mr Lay conceived a different mo del in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporat e users or utilities in faraway regions at whatever price the market would bear In the early s Congress under heavy lobbying by Enron passed le gislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers Before long Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates The market for interstate sales of natur al gas had been freed up a few years earlier and critics complained that t raders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices In the mids independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress to allow the creation of a cooperative marketing organization which the y hoped would have helped stabilize prices Raymond Plank the chairman of the Apache Corporation a gas producer based in Houston said that the big gas marketing and trading companies includi ng Enron successfully lobbied to kill the plan leaving prices as volatile as ever It was a great concept Mr Plank said We could have headed off the problems we have today Enrons final lobbying success came last year With a strong push from the companys lobbyists Congress passed futures trading legislation that exemp ted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline the industry leader from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Enron takes t he other side of trades on its exchange In traditional markets like the Ne w York Mercantile Exchange which remain subject to oversight the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers Under Mr Watson Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron and tho ugh California politicians denounced it too as a profiteer during the ene rgy crisis most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in bot h its business practices and its lobbying Indeed the rival energytrading executive today predicted a huge culture clash as the Houston neighbors merge Blood will flow in Houston over the integration of the trading operation he said But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with Earlier this year the federal energy commission asked for comments on whet her it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines an d energytrading shops owned by the same company Enron wondered what all the bother was Would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not it wrote in a regulatory fili ng or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the m ore successful participants in the marketplace Dynegy by contrast painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down Abuses abound it said because of financial windfalls diffic ulty of detection lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the m arket

Corp the oncehighflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to p rofit from Californias energy deregulation made it a target of consumer an d political backlash on Friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival Dynegy Inc The roughly billion deal is a stunning plot twist for Houstonbased En ron which was vilified in California as it was being glorified on Wall Str eet In only the last month a series of disturbing financial revelations p ushed to the edge of ruin this oncepowerful company whose top executives had lectured California on its energy foibles and who influenced the direct ion of national energy policy Enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and i n the end financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing Now the company that late last year had a market value of billion is w orth onetenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a crosstown competit or onequarter its size Enrons proud and influential chairman and chief e xecutive Kenneth L Lay who became a focus of bitter attacks by Californi a politicians and regulators would lose his job as would many others at E nron Even the name would disappear The combined company would be called Dynegy Inc if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder appr ovals California officials took no joy in Enrons fate Friday though there was p erhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state This is basically a rogue corporation said Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon an outspoken critic of Enron for years who dealt with the company as he c haired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of Californi as landmark electricity deregulation plan in It has from the beginn ing been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher lawa fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land A Failed Experiment Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said that although Enron was never a major force in Californias doomed electricity market it was outs poken in support of deregulation In a sense their experiment was much like Californias experimenta fail ure he said Said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consum er Rights in Santa Monica Nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents which reape d the reward of deregulation is suffering the consequences Enron is the worlds largest energy trader handling one of four energy dea ls in the United States through its online trading operation EnronOnline Since it reported a surprising thirdquarter loss on Oct partly tied t o shadowy investment vehicles Enron has

at per share on the New York Stoc k Exchange Enron added cents to close at per share still off year to date If the deal closes in six to nine months as the parties expect Dynegy and ChevronTexaco would invest billion additionally in the combined company This is just a financial bonanza really for both companies said Charles L Watson Dynegy chairman and chief executive who will head the combined company Watson said the merger would immediately add to Dynegys earnings Even so the repercussions of Enrons fall from grace could be farreaching Coming on the heels of Californias energy crisis Enrons troubles may s low the countrys march toward energy deregulation which Lay and Enron cha mpioned for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in gener al But the deal announced Friday will prevent an even worse outcome energy ex perts said the threatened collapse of Enron which would clog up for a tim e the business of buying and selling electricity natural gas and oil That could interfere with delivery of energy around the country they said This is an encouraging development for the energy industry said Stephen Baum chairman of Sempra Energy the San Diegobased parent of Southern Cal ifornia Gas and San Diego Gas Electric The EnronDynegy combination wil l create a creditworthy counterparty which will help preserve order in th e marketplace It also will reinforce confidence in the energy trading busi ness going forward But some in the industry are less pleased Raymond Plank chairman of Apache Corp a Houstonbased natural gas explor ation and development firm said he is considering a motion to the Federal Trade Commission against the proposed merger There are issues of concentration in a combination of the largest energy t rader Enron and the fifthlargest Dynegy Plank said California shoul d be particularly concerned because Dynegy owns power plants there and Enro n has pipelines and other interests Troubles Mount as Stock Plunges The swagger that was Enron is long gone Consider Enrons brash chief executive Jeffrey K Skilling touted only months ag o as one of the young stars of American business abruptly resigned in Augu st citing personal reasons Enrons stock already had fallen from its high of nearly per share as investments in water and telecommunications tur ned sour a fact that contributed to Skillings departure The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of E nrons controversial dealings with a number of limited partnerships some o rganized and run by Enron managers including Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S Fastow who was ousted last month In an extraordinary confession Thursday Enron announced that it had over stated profit by million or during the last five years The earl ier financial statements reported to Wall Street and the investing public Enron said should not be relied upon The company also fired its treasurer and a corporate lawyer both of whom it said were investors in one of the limited partnerships Yet some analys ts questioned whether even in its admission of accounting trickery Enron wasnt still holding something back Creditrating agencies which already have downgraded Enrons bonds to ba rely above junk status continue to pore over Enrons books Analysts hav e said a further downgrade to the level of junk or below investment grade could precipitate a crisis akin to a run on a bank and threaten Enrons su rvival while the merger is pending With its stock crumbling and trading partners leery about its ability to pa y its debts Enron was forced to walk hat in hand down Houstons Energy All ey to negotiate a saving takeover by Dynegy the rival once jokingly dismis sed as Enron Lite In the trading markets where Enron still holds a leading but increasingly v ulnerable position other players already are stepping up to grab a bigger share of the business Even if Enrons trading operation survives more or l ess intact under the wing of a Dynegy or some other company experts said it may never regain its former level of dominance Enron has been a very innovative shop willing to spend considerably to es tablish new markets said analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York If that culture is not kept everyone loses Skilling and mentor Lay had worked for a decade to create both a new kind o f company and a new set of markets for it to play In large part they succeeded Enron transformed itself from a traditional gas pipeline company into a hightech global trader of everything from elec tricity to pollution credits to aluminum The companys overarching strateg y was to pare its physical assets to the minimum to get the maximum profit bang from its intellectual capital the ranks of MBAs and PhDs that filled its Houston trading floor Rather than maintain its own expensive gas fields and power plantswhich i t relegated to stodgy utilities and oil companiesEnron would handle every thing by contract relying on a network of suppliers to obtain store and d eliver the goods while the company focused on squeezing out the best price Dynegy in contrast has invested in such energy assets including three po wer plants in Southern California It uses those assets to back its trading operation which is much smaller than Enrons Enron pulled off a migration from the dirty extreme of the oil patch the assetintensive domain of drillers and explorers to the clean end wher e all the deals are done on a computer screen It also was a migration from lower profit margins and lower risk to high margins and high risk Shannon B Burchett chief executive of Risk Limited Corp an energyorien ted strategicmanagement consultancy in Dallas compared Enron to the inves tment bank Salomon Bros where he used to work in the former PhiBro commod ities unit Enron Burchett said embodies a Wall Street culture that happens to be in Houston Wall Street certainly got it or thought it did Accounting Rules Pushed to the Limit At Enrons zenith last year when its stock peaked near a share and it was pushing into esoteric markets for weather derivatives and fiberoptic b andwidth Enron seemed to be a onecompany wave of the future Enrons aggressiveness brainpower and willingness to back radical new idea s with serious capital helped it acquire an aura that in some ways was its undoing analysts said Investors accorded Enrons stock a pricetoearnings valuation that was con sistently higher than those of its peers reflecting the view that its cutt ingedge business model could consistently deliver fastergrowing profit th an its competitors To keep profits arcing ever upward to justify the outsize valuation Enron began pushing the accounting rules as hard as it pushed competitors in the trading arena It acknowledged as much in its statement Thursday conceding that the operations of three of the limited partnerships should have been consolidated with Enrons own financial statements instead of being held se parate By raising capital and running deals through the limited partnerships Enro n could keep large amounts of debt and certain volatile assets off its own balance sheet while simultaneously booking profit from the partnerships t ransactions analyst Meade said Deals Backed by Costly Guarantees One risky aspect of some of Enrons deals through the partnerships was what Meade called a doubletrigger guarantee under which Enron would pledge a cash payout if either its bond rating fell below investment grade or its stock declined below a certain price The guarantees must have seemed a cheap way to sweeten a deal when Enrons stock was flying high but they came back to haunt the company later when it had to pay cash to make good on its obligations Meade said Other energytrading companies use similar devices but Enron carried it to an extreme and disclosed too little detail to make the process understanda ble to investors he said Enrons magic like that of the Internetstock phenomenon had never been e asy to understand in the first place The company had a reputation among an alysts for providing scanty financial detail and hardtograsp explanations of some of its dealings But as long as the reported profit kept climbing Enron kept getting the be nefit of the doubt M Carol Coale a respected Houstonbased analyst for Prudential Securities ruefully recalled a time last winter when she told Enron she could find no positive catalyst for the stock and was considering downgrading her inv estment opinion Skilling telephoned Coale and asked her to hold off promising her that the re was unspecified good news on the horizon that would justify her faith I believed him Coale said last week in an interview in Houston She held her rating steady at that time but has since downgraded Enron to an outrig ht sell Instead of Skillings promised good news questions mounted during the spri ng and Enrons stock continued a steady decline Coale and other analysts were troubled that a large proportion of Enrons earnings seemed to come no t from its core trading operations but from unusual transactions involving the companys own stock or that of affiliates In California Enron played a key role as chief cheerleader for electricity deregulation and a key energy middleman in the state As wholesale electri city prices soared and the state plunged into its energy crisis late last y ear Enron and other outofstate electricity generators and traders became favorite targets of California politicians and regulators who said the co mpanies were manipulating the market and charging too much for power But significantly California was not a directly successful territory for E nron Markets in water did not develop as Enron subsidiary Azurix envisioned And Enrons plans for selling electricity to retail customers were deferred ev en as deregulation took effect in because the states deregulation for mulas didnt allow room for retail competition Lay complained about California frequently and met with the governor to try to influence the states moves to repair its energy problems In an interv iew in his Houston office in Januaryoverlooking Enrons new headquarters building which is still under construction as the companys name disappear sLay said he and other Enron executives had objected to the way Californi a regulation was set up We objected more vehemently than anyone We opposed the concept of the poo l he said referring to the nowdefunct California Power Exchange in whi ch most of the states power was bought and sold in an hourly market What competitive market in the world has a pool We dont buy our groceries thr ough a centralized PX Enron also backed away from building a small power plant in California last year when the state imposed price caps One of the loudest complaints by Davis and other California officials was t hat generators of electricity were playing games to get higher prices They criticized Enron severely too even though it was not a major generat or because the level of its worldwide trading operationsbuying and selli ng contracts worth billions of dollars in electric power every daygave En ron immense sway over pricing and supplies of electricity They also believ e that Enron and Lay helped play a part in the reluctance of federal regula tors for several months to place restraints on the California marketplace CEOs Future Role Uncertain Millions of people in California businesses lost money because this rogue company succeeded in controlling the government of the United States said state Sen Peace one of the architects of the states deregulation plan Ken Lay was a mystic Peace said Whatever he said had to make sense bec ause he was Ken Lay It was hero worship Many of the people working as economists at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission worshiped Ken Lay As a consequence the things Enron promoted a nd pushed for were never challenged intellectually and otherwise Lay who has been asked to sit on the board of the combined company said F riday that he had not yet decided whether to accept He described his time building Enron as a very long ride Its been a very good ride for the most part I

Forced to Negotiating Table After Disclosing That It Had Overstated Earnings Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer The Washington Post FINAL E Copyright The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved Embattled Enron Corp yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about billion from crosstown rival Dynegy Inc If the deal is completed it would end Houstonbased Enrons reign as the leader in the huge energy trading m arkets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation Its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered Enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a co mplex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the tradin g powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligatio ns Four top Enron officials have resigned or been replaced since July and once Dynegy takes control Enrons chairman and chief executive Kenneth L ay will also leave the company Lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept Dynegys offer to serve on the combined companys board Its been a good ride for a long time Lay said in a conference call last night The last three weeks havent been a whole lot of fun The final deal was announced after the close of stock trading Enrons shar es which had fallen from to after the disclosures ended the da y slightly higher at Dynegys stock closed at up Dynegy offered all stock for the Enron shares so the total value of the de al will fluctuate with Dynegys stock price Dynegy also said it would assu me about billion in Enron debt bringing the total value of the transac tion to around billion Dynegys rescue of Enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of billion which will be supplied by ChevronTexaco Corp a major Dynegy sto ckholder ChevronTexaco will invest another billion in Dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as Enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the Securitie s and Exchange Commission The takeover agreement gives Dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cance l the purchase if Enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgm ents from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships Chuck Watson Dynegys chairman and chief executive said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of Enrons financial co ndition convinced him that the companys trading and pipeline businesses we re solid We looked under the hood and guess what It looked just as stro ng as we thought it was Watson said he did not think more damaging disclo sures were forthcoming from Enron Until the partnership mess Enron was the nations dominant energy trader and it had frontdoor political connections to the White House Lay its lo ngtime chairman raised more then for the presidential election ca mpaign of his friend George W Bush Enron rode the growth of energy tradin g markets beginning in the mids as first natural gas and then electr ic power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level Its revenues leaped from billion in to billion last year During those heady times the Houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its Byzantine bo okkeeping It was always very difficult to get information said Louis B Gagliardi an analyst with John S Herold Inc They would always rebuff you Until this fall the muscular company seemed too big to stumble said inves tment manager David Coxe with Harris Insight Equity Fund in Chicago Coxe bought shares of Enron at a share in August after wrestlin g with the decision for months he said Then Jeffrey Skilling Enrons chi ef executive and strategic mastermind unexpectedly resigned The stock wh ich had been as high as in August pitched downward Enron seemed so indispensable to the nations energy markets that I though t it inconceivable it could implode Coxe said Thats how I got sucked i n Enrons fall is classic hubris Coxe said a Greek tragedy striking someo ne who chose to defy the gods in this case the rules of the system Among the rules that Enron now acknowledges it didnt follow were the accou nting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created The pu rpose of the partnerships Enron said was to reduce the risks of investmen ts in Internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other asse ts it no longer wanted The accounting errors were described in a page SEC filing Enron made Thu rsday The errors resulted in a billion reduction in the value of shar eholders equity The company also said it had overstated its earnings by million since Enron created partnerships that would buy major assets such as a power p lant that Enron wanted to sell or in other cases assets such as fiber optic cable networks that Enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet The partnerships had outside investors but the general partner of two of t hem was Enrons own chief financial officer Andrew Fastow He earned m illion in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships according to the SEC document Enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock or securities convertible into stock Some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans resulting in the billion drop in sharehold er equity Enron now says Investors are asking why Enrons auditor Arthur Andersen LLP did not insi st that these transactions be handled that way in the first place Enrons SEC filing mentions but does not explain some proposed audit adjustments over the past four years that were overruled Even though as Enron now acknowledges it created an information barrier masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pu shing hard enough to punch through that barrier some analysts acknowledge It was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and s ay I dont understand it Gagliardi said The questions are now coming from a new committee reporting to Enrons boa rd that will investigate how the companys financial reporting was handled from the SEC and eventually from teams of lawyers representing aggrieve d shareholders Lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that Enron emp loyees other than Fastow had profited from the partnership activity Enron directors had approved Fastows management of the partnerships but Fastow quit the partnerships in July and was then replaced as chief financial offi cer Enron this week fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant an Enron division lawyer who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by Fastow The Enron report to the SE C describes a central role in these transactions played by Michael J Koppe r an associate of Fastow who left Enron in July to take over Fastows fina ncial interests in the partnership the company said Enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovere d about outside partnership investments Financial Desk The Nation NEWS ANALYSIS A Visionary Fallen From Grace JAMES FLANIGAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company A year ago Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth L Lay was on top of the energy wo rld As a leading fundraiser contributor and energy advisor to the Bush a dministration he played a key role in shaping the new presidents energy p olicy As head of the worlds largest energy trading company he had an eno rmous influence on the price of energy in California and across the nation Enrons highflying stock helped him cash out million in stock options last year alone On Friday with Enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival Dynegy Inc Lays career and reputation are in shambles Under the merger he will be stripped of a management job His integrity is tattered with Enrons controversial financial dealings under federal in vestigation Enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged becau se the companys stock lost of its value in recent weeks The rapid rise and fall of Lay is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the worlds energy markets was overcome with arrogance associates and critics say Under Lay Enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its finan cial collapse they say That in turn could have resulted in a widespread d isruption in energy supplies Enrons behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets It is a very serious matter said Edward R Muller an energy investor and f ormer president of Edison Internationals Mission Energy subsidiary Nobody denies hes smart but its a question of integrity said Raymond Plank chief executive of Apache Corp and an associate of Lays in Houston s vibrant oil and gas industry Lay and longtime partner Jeffrey K Skilling who served briefly as Enrons chief executive before resigning abruptly in August rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designe d to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy Lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new marketd riven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmissi on The financial markets that Lay and his Enron associates created had an enor mous effect on Californias disastrous experiment in electricity deregulati on Critics say his influence was excessive and misguided Ken Lay was a mystic said state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon an outspo ken critic of Enron Whatever he said had to make sense because he was Ken Lay It was hero worship Many of the people working as economists at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission worshiped Ken Lay As a consequence t he things Enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged intellectual ly and otherwise Lay who has a doctorate in economics had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for h is childrens education In the Navy in the late s Lay was assigned to the Defense Department because of his economic acumen He allocated Penta gon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military said Mark Pal mer chief spokesman for Enron Lay worked for Exxon and other energy firms in the s amid soaring oil prices gasoline shortages and stillregulated natural gas He headed Houst on Natural Gas a predecessor firm of Enron in the s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for Houstons energy indu stries When the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any produ cer Lay turned Enron into a foremost firm in the new deregulated industry Still Enron almost went bankrupt in the late s with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling It was then that Skilling a McKinsey Co consultant suggested to Lay th at the firm trade longterm contracts for gas promising to deliver the com modity to customers at fixed prices buying and selling contracts of varyin g maturities the way mortgage companies deal with mortgages in Skilling s words The innovation started Enrons rapid growth and rise to prominence as the e mbodiment of a new kind of energy company In the s the federal govern ment called for deregulation of electricity Lay saw opportunities He and Skilling created a market for contracts in el ectricity in and by Enron was the worlds leading firm doing suc h business Lays central idea was that by creating a market of millions of buyers and sellers constantly taking positions power supplies could be allocated eff iciently and prices lowered Lay liked to lecture in an avuncular way abo ut the new economics of energy trading Technology is changing and theres a lot more value in flexibility and op tionality Just about in every industry you can make them a lot more effic ient when you have more optionality Lay said in an interview in January i n his Houston offices overlooking the sparkling new Enron headquarters buil ding which still is under construction As Enrons business profile grew so did Lays political influence He serv ed as an energy advisor to both Bush administrations and headed Texas fund raising for George W Bushs presidential campaign Lay raised for the BushCheney campaign and with his wife Linda Lay contributed anothe r to help finance the inaugural gala this year As the administration prepared its energy plan Lay gained national stature as a preacher of market economics applied to electricity Theres no way you can centralize a commandcontrol environment and make t he best decisions to have an efficient lowcost reliable electricity indu stry Lay said His sermon was intended for California which suffered sharply higher price s for electricity last winter to the point that private utilities fell int o or near bankruptcy and the state budget incurred a cost of billion w hich Sacramento now is trying to recover through the sale of revenue bonds Because Enron trading billions of dollars a day in power contracts worldwi de had an immense effect on electricity prices Lays preaching grated on state officials Driven to intemperance state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer said in May that hed like to escort Lay to a prison cell But more than economic philosophy was behind Lays goading of California T he states debacle gave energy deregulation a bad name and chilled deregula tion moves by many other states That in turn reduced growth prospects for Enron The promise of continued g rowth in deregulation had helped make Enron a Wall Street darling Its stoc k price at one point nearly a share versus less than now pushed u p the value of Enron stock options held by almost all employees but owned in great amounts by Lay Skilling and other company officers Lay cashed in last year converting options for a gain of million whi le Skilling gained million by converting his options As they cashed in Enron was encountering other problems Attempts to set up trading markets in water and broadband Internet transmission were floundering A major pow er plant venture in India was in grave economic and political trouble But in the last month Enron revealed that it had reduced the firms equity value by more than billion due to writeoffs in a hitherto hidden partn ership Revelations then cascaded The firm had such partnerships which had bil lions of dollars in debt for which Enron was liable Lay and Skilling piled up debt in hidden partnerships analysts explain because the firm needed huge amounts of debt to support its greatly expanding levels of trading in electricity natural gas and other commodities But the firm could not support such debt and still retain its credit rating growth rate and high stock price After weeks of gamely protesting that t he business was sound and that he personally took offense at investment ana lysts suggestions of impropriety Lay fell silent Times staff writer

HOUSTON AP Energy marketer Dynegy Inc announced Friday that it will bu y its much larger rival the once mighty but now troubled Enron Corp for billion in stock Dynegy also will assume a hefty billion in Enron d ebt The announcement came after Enrons stock price plummeted about percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasnt revea ling serious financial problems to shareholders Under the deal ChevronTexaco Corp which owns more than a quarter of Dyne gy would quickly provide about billion ChevronTexaco also would cont ribute an additional billion upon completion of the deal the companies said With its marketmaking capabilities earnings power and proven strategic a pproach to wholesale markets Enron is the ideal strategic partner for Dyne gy Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer Chuck Watson said in annou ncing the purchase Watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial pract ices that prompted explosive disclosures by Enron this week including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off t he companys books As a combined company we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and as always we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financ ial structure as key priorities Watson said Enron is the countrys top buyer and seller of natural gas and the No w holesale power

and chief executive Kenneth L Lay will no longer have a rol e in daytoday management of the company but has been offered a seat on t he combined companys board and will help shepherd the merger through Dynegy said that Greg Whalley the current president and chief operating of ficer of Enron will become an executive vice president of the new Dynegy He said the merger sets the best course for Enron Few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provi ded us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger wit h Dynegy could deliver Whalley said Together with Enrons recently anno unced bank commitments this cash infusion gives Enron immediate liquidity which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating The merger was announced a day after Enron acknowledged it overstated earni ngs by about percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investi gation by the Securities and Exchange Commission Analysts said the merger rescues Enron but leaves Dynegy in uncharted terr itory with the outcome of the SEC investigation completely unknown Ther e is still a shroud hanging over Enron that now moves over to Dynegy said Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities Early Friday Moodys Investors Service downgraded Enrons debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the companys longterm debt rati ngs remain under review for further downgrade In an SEC filing Enron said financial statements from through the fir st half of should not be relied upon and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the com panys earnings reports The revised statements reduced Enrons profits for those years by mill ion from billion to billion The revisions also increased the companys debt each of the four years reaching billion milli on more than previously reported by the end of Keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured Enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses whole sale trading of natural gas and electricity But the companys stock price started dropping months ago when its high speed Internet unit foundered and Enron had trouble collecting money from p ower customers in

Press All Rights Reserved HOUSTON AP After Enron Corp tapped into more than billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers stock prices dropped Enron Corps stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday Shares fell cents on Friday to a level not seen since as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the companys earnings announcement earlier this month The stock is down more than percent in two weeks and the company lost almost billion in market value Late this week the company decided to convert billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash The company put about billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of shortterm corporate IOU known as commercial paper Nothing spells confidence quite like cash which is what we want investors to understand said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the billion banked this week Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as good management decisions On Oct Enrons thirdquarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about ThenChief

CoInvestment did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in

me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management BARRONS REVIEW PREVIEW Capital Markets Report Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Turning Up the Heat Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO Andrew S Fastow Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence Enron shares have plunged recently after it announced the probe and reported a million loss BARRONS The Trader Dow Jones Commodities Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Bulls Look To Recovery As Techs Lead The Surge By Andrew Barry In what undoubtedly will become a businessschool case study Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a fullblown financial crisis last week Enrons stock plunged to following a point drop in the prior week and the companys bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around By weeks end Enron had drawn down billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly billion in maturing commercial paper leaving it only about billion of net liquidity Enrons big energy trading operation which accounts for the bulk of the companys profits and most of its equity valuation now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies but the company is likely to remain an investmentgrade credit Moodys Investors Service now rates its debt Baa three notches above junk One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades concerned about Enrons viability push for settlement of the trades precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed LongTerm Capital Management in Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation Enron has resisted refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enroncreated partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly billion loss on that deal Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the companys credit ratings There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets including its moneylosing broadband business Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its secondquarter book value of a share but its worth noting that tangible book excluding goodwill was only a share Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enrons billion asset writedown and its stillmysterious billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships The thirdquarter book value wont be known until Enron releases its balance sheet which may not occur until its quarterly Q is released The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didnt demand it The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the companys leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts confidence in management The Street really didnt provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a billion valuation That value has since shrunk to billion Enrons woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets Until last week Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enrons financial health Enron had about billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed offbalancesheet debt Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years Judging from the companys rather meager credit lines Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets City Enron directors cash in shares By Simon English The Daily Telegraph P c Telegraph Group Limited London LEADING executives at Enron the troubled US energy giant cashed in shares worth more than m m this year in the runup to a financial crunch that has left the companys credibility in ruins Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay chief executive sold about shares this year netting him more than m He still held m shares until July Other executives made similar sales a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from at the start of the year to by July They halved again this week and fell to below yesterday Enron declined to comment on the share sales Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to dispel uncertainty in the financial community by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enrons financial strength Enron will pay off debts of billion and keep another in cash He said We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow former chief financial officer

KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News Houston Chronicle Texas Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Enron Corps stock price hit its lowest point in more

release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about ThenChief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow with the Enron boards approval had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest The partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the companys newer businesses such as broadband trading Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in shareholder equity new questions began to arise Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected but The Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence In drawing down the billion line of revolving credit this week the company put about billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer and often with more flexible terms Investors in commercial paper who are actually more like lenders since its actually a form of debt are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of shortterm investments The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit To some extent redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets which look at it negatively said Anatol Feygin an analyst with JP Morgan But reducing the companys debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools like a revolving line of credit could give great peace of mind to Enrons investors he said It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business which is really the core of their operations Feygin said Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities still sees the move as somewhat confusing Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange mixed message she said Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back Is it a gesture for customers It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management Jeff Dietert an analyst at Simmons Co said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned In a worstcase scenario investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron That could lead to lower credit ratings which would force Enrons energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it Thus we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues Dietert wrote in a report Friday Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store For example a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco It was formed in with about million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets Chewco was run by Michael Kopper a managing director of Enrons Global Equity Markets Group Frankly that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity Feygin said Until now

Corporation trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday using billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than billion in cash The moves did not appear to reassure investors as Enrons share price fell to another sixyear low Shares traded as low as yesterday before ending the day at down cents The move will raise the interest expense for the company because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional billion Enrons debt is rated investment grade But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default But with the bonds trading so low it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper Enrons stock has been plunging since Oct shortly after it disclosed that its thirdquarter balance sheet which has yet to be released will show a billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated

CaliforniansFYI the only people who knew who we invited to the meeting but did not attend were Dick Riordan and Kevin Sharer Saturday May SF Chronicle Enrons secret bid to save deregulationPRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Energy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp quietly courted Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to Californias energy crisis His prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and federal investigations and less rather than more regulation Lay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign contributors hosted a private minute meeting in a conference room at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday Among the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star Schwarzenegger and Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates One participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support Lays vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the states energy mess PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by either reregulating the system or creating a government authority to provide electricity Gov Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in California Theyre trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron executives They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea At the meeting Enron representatives circulated a fourpage position paper titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The Chronicle It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in debt incurred by the states public utilities and that investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power generators and traders a possibility given credibility in studies by regulators and economists One of the talking points read Get deregulation right this time California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a competitive power market system Lay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially produces nothing but makes money as a middleman buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased percent to billion Asked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment One participant said Denne was present at the meeting DC CONNECTIONS Meanwhile Lays power in Washington is reported to have reached unprecedented heights According to a story in yesterdays New York Times Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them The story also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lays desire to further deregulate the nations electricity system Lay denied the allegation Also in attendance at this weeks meeting were Bruce Karatz chief executive of home builder Kaufman Broad Ray Irani chief executive of Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant Amgen Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the worlds first civilian space trip Milken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but declined to be interviewed Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon A spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor attended but was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this issue His intent is to listen to all sides Attached to the Enron handout was a twopage open letter addressed to Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support Lays position and would be willing to sign their names to it The source who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda Email the writers at and Scott Winokur

probabilities by using solid statistical research GEs next chief will replace an executive who has become a poster boy for Americanstyle capitalism Welchs relentless focus on profit and market share

you in the best of health I think I speak for everybody when I tell you that w eve been very very good this time around so this is going to be a rather long list Grab something wet pull up a Barcalounger and pay attention At the outset let me say I consider it a miracle that this letter reached you at all I figure you have security up the wazoo what with all the wack os sending stuff through the snail mail That whole drill has to make your job a lot tougher Be patient Santa and dont cut corners Dont get comp lacent Theres more than one evildoer who would love to take the blush out of the cheeks of a symbol of Western hedonism like you But dont worry ab out this letter of course If theres any white powder on the envelope it came from one of the freshly baked doughnuts I have waiting on the mantle for your upcoming visit Anyhow this year its clear that many many people are a lot more needy th an I am so in the spirit of the season Im gonna ask for their presents fi rst I should start I guess with the poor folks at Andersen the accounting an d consulting firm Boy Santa do those guys need some new calculators Ple ase get a whole bunch for them They approved the books for the fellows ove r at Enron whose earnings didnt turn out to really be what they said they were at first Then they had to restate them Was their collective face re d Im sure if the Andersen people had better equipment they wouldnt have screwed up like that with Enron or with all the other corporations they s eemingly permitted to wank around with their numbers in exchange for hefty consulting fees While were at it I suppose we cant ignore the senior management that use d to run Enron either What a bunch of boneheads But this is the holiday t ime of year Santa the season of forgiveness and giving so why not make t heir executive homes your first stop They need a lot Santa To start with theyre gonna want like thousands of hours of legal time from expensive firms so give them that And why not throw in a couple of files they can bake into cakes for later on On your way out of town forget about toys and games and stuff like that an d just please leave a ton of money under the tree of every Enron employee particularly the fired ones and of course the older ones who thought they were going to have something to retire on And as for the financial planner s who allowed employees ks to hold solely the companys stock I supp ose you should bring very special presents for them tooI cant think of what thoughHow about we let the Enron work force figure that one out There are so many business executives to think about this year too Most of them you could make happy with fractional growth in Ebitda for the quarter That would be a huge surprise and you know how much executives like plea sant surprises Bill Gates You dont need to bring anything for him Santa He has just ab out everything you know and what he doesnt have he can certainly take o ver and repackage as part of his

computermanufacturing side of the business but when you get right down to it hes simply being a bummer thats all Please Santa Bring Carly her merger Shes staked her whole reputationand her b onus next yearon the outcome and you know any CEO who is willing to ri sk compensation on something must want it really really bad While youre at it please bring John Chambers the head of Cisco a good s tock

STANLEY BING is a real executive at a real FORTUNE company hed rather not name He can be reached at COLOR ILLUSTRATION MILAN TRENC FeaturesThe Credit Watchers The Geeks Who Rule The World Theres a reason Moodys and SP have been d oing so well Their customers cant say no Bethany McLean Reporter Associate Doris Burke Fortune Magazine Time Inc Copyright On Nov when Standard Poors and then Moodys downgraded Enrons debt below the allimportant status investment grade the companys bankruptc y became a foregone conclusion The downgrades confirmed that Enron would n o longer be able to support its trading operations by accessing the capital markets and they triggered the repayment of billions of dollars of debt But the onetwo credit punches pointed not just to a TKO of Enron They wer e also a reminder of the immense and seemingly ever increasing power of th e agencies themselves A muchcoveted tripleA rating the highest grade i s the grease in an otherwise squeaky engine It makes every aspect of doing business easier from raising money to convincing customers that operation s are solid In contrast an SP or Moodys downgrade is a fearsome event t hat can dramatically increase a companys cost of capital perhaps even des troy its ability to raise money As one critic put it decades ago they ret ain an almost biblical authority Thats because the rating agenciesprivate forprofit companies that are privy to insider informationhave come to play a quasi regulatory role in the market Many big investors from pension funds to insurance companies to money market funds are prohibited from owning more than a set amount o f lowerrated debt for instance But while the Enron debacle is evidence of the agencies power it also bri ngs some longsimmering criticismthink back to when the agencies fa iled to downgrade New York Citys debt until the citys fiscal crisis was o bviousto a frothy boil Critics say that the credit czars for all their inside access didnt identify this borrowers woes any earlier than the re st of us didand they didnt downgrade the debt even after the severity of the problems was well known Indeed prior to the downgrades Enrons debt was trading at around cents on the dollar a sign that the market had a lready dismissed the companys investmentgrade status as farce The ratin g agencies are always late grouses one portfolio manager Of course neither John Rutherfurd the CEO of Moodys nor Leo ONeill S Ps president see things that way We communicated our view that Enrons rating was dependent on its merger with Dynegy clearly and frequently s ays ONeill Adds Rutherford We do not want to rush to judgment nor do we delay in informing investors when we believe fundamentals have changed How can the same entities be allpowerful and strangely afterthe fact at the same time That is one of the more puzzling conundrums in todays capit al markets The nearly regulatory function of the agencies and the weight t heir opinions carry make their judgments criticalbut also complicated Th e agencies can be not just observers but active participants in the course of events Thats because a downgrade can become a selffulfilling prophecy If the rating agencies act too rashly they could be accused of causing a bankruptcy Yet if they deliberate too long theyll simply be stating wha t everyone already knowsespecially since today unlike in the s there is an army of outside fixedincome analysts that both challenge the rating agencies judgments and profit from anticipating their actions True this debate rarely reaches Enronesque proportions And its worth em phasizing that corporate debt is just a small part of these agencies purvi ews They analyze almost every fixedincome instrument out there from the debt of China to the complex bonds backed by cash flows from say the Miss issippi tobacco settlement Their power in fact is very much entwined wit h that omnipresence Moodys alone claims that it rates more than trill ion of the worlds debt from over countries corporations and public finance obligations Whats more the agencies appear in the wide lens of history to be fairly accurate in their judgments As both ONeill and Rutherfurd note its rar e that investment grade credits go kaput Both agencies have statistics sh owing that less than of bonds rated A or better default over a fiveyea r period In addition around of the credits in the domestic A class st ill hold the rating at year end implying stability in higherrated bonds But by its sheer size the Enron implosion challenges that perception of sta bility And it draws attention to the agencies at a particularly interestin g timefor Moodys especially Until recently the actual businesses of Moo dys and SP were hidden away inside much larger companies SP is still bu ried within McGrawHill But in October Dun Bradstreet spun Moodys out as a separate company For the first time ever outsiders can perform a credit check on a rating agency Combing through Moodys financials makes one thing perfectly clear Credit rating is a fabulous business Since its spinoff Moodys stock has climbed yes climbedsome giving Moodys the same market value as Bear Stea rns This year the rating agency is expected to generate about million in revenues less than a tenth of Bears revenues and an astounding million in operating income And Moodys does this with just employee s Perhaps its not surprising that Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway is the companys largest shareholder owning just about of the stock Henr y Berghoef of Harris Associates another large Moodys holder says that th e biggest challenge facing CEO Rutherfurd is the proper management of the c ompanys immense free cash flow Rutherfurd himself a scholarly whitehai red yearold has few complaints Its a big thrill he says Indeed whats not to like For one thing Moodys potential customers almo st cant say no As Merrill analyst Joanne Park wrote in a recent report In many cases a Moodys rating is practically a prerequisite for coming to market with a new issue of fixedincome securities Like an investment ba nk Moodys is a big beneficiary of the longterm growth in the capital mar ketswithout even having to risk its own capital Kevin Gruneich an analy st at Bear Stearns calculates that over the past years Moodys revenue and profits grew at compound annual rates of and respectivelya g rowth trend he terms incredible Rutherfurd adds that in the past yea rs profits have fallen only once in In recent years Moodys has st abilized its revenue still further basically creating an annuity stream by instituting what it calls relationship pricing Instead of hiring Moody s on a transactional basis some of its customers now pay an annual fee in return Moodys rates every bond issue they do Relationship pricing now accounts for of Moodys revenues Both Moodys and SP have also done a remarkable job of keeping pace with i nnovations in the capital markets Witness the explosion of a new type of d ebt known as structured financea bond for instance backed by the cash flow from residential mortgages Here the rating is everything It measure s the level of risk in an extremely complicated security and determines the yield that must be paid to attract investors The rating agencies play an integral role in distributing paper into the marketplace says Kevin Rigb y head of Deutsche Banks rating advisory business which helps Deutsches clients argue their cases to the rating agencies In yet another indicati on of the agencies power many of the major investment banks have entire d epartments that do this Structured finance is now Moodys largest busines s accounting for onethird of its revenues up from almost nothing in the late s As Moodys pushes aggressively into new markets it has expanded its power base as well Rutherfurd is especially excited about Europe which currentl y accounts for about of the companys sales He notes happily that ther e are about unrated companies with revenues greater than one billion euros Money coming out of banking and into the capital markets should pro pel growth in ratings for the next decade he says quickly adding But w e love banks too Indeed Recently the Basel Committee on Banking Supervis ion proposed that ratings be used globally to determine banks capital adeq uacy The proposal seems to be on hold for now This is certainly not a state of affairs that John Moody would have imagine d when he began providing statistics on railroad bonds back in In the beginning it was all very simple Investors paid for Moodys research whi ch helped disseminate important information to the market Some two decades later the government was mandating that banks use ratings to determine the values of their investment portfolios Then in the second half of the cen tury the SEC began to rely on ratings to determine what sort of securities insurance companies pension plans brokerdealers and money market funds could own Both Moodys and SP resisted those developments for a number o f reasonsbut they didnt say no I dont think that ratings should be us ed to determine investment policy ONeill maintains today Moodys has wr itten a number of letters protesting the use of ratings in regulatory polic y Another substantial change occurred around Prior to that time Moodys and SP had always earned their keep from investor subscriptions Given th e growing volume of work however those economics no longer made sense So first Moodys and then SP began to charge issuers instead Theres a cons tant worry that this poses a conflict of interest But unlike equity analys ts the credit analysts dont have to worry about buying business with favo rable ratings Companies simply dont have a lot of choice The most controversial development came in when the SEC worried that flybynight rating agencies could wreak havoc on the market initiated a m outhful of a designation the nationally recognized statistical rating org anization or NSRSO To comply with various SEC regulations a companys r ating had to come from an NSRSO essentially Moodys SP or Fitch a sm aller competitor that is a subsidiary of French concern Fimalac The design ation has become the subject of intense debate The SEC has enveloped the agencies in a very protective webbing that keeps anyone else from challen ging them says Lawrence White an economics professor at NYU There they are a firm industry sitting pretty But no one has a better idea Says Rick Roberts a former SEC commissioner who is now an attorney at The len Reid Priest Its a very uncomfortable situation but its impractic al to take out what is already there There have been other complaints about the clout the agencies have Moody s in particular In the early s allegations began to swirl that Moodys bullied municipalities into hiring it by issuing unsolicited and negative ratings to those that declined the offer One Colorado school district su ed the rater after it made negative comments about a pending bond sale cla iming that investors used the pan to demand a higher interest rate resulti ng in a net loss of The court ruled that Moodys ratings were opi nions not factsand therefore the company was protected under the First A mendment But that hardly settles the broader issue In the capital markets the ratin gs can function as facts even if they arent Thats because of the numerou s regulations that are built around them The Continental Divide is between investmentgrade securities and non investmentgrade securities because many investors like pension funds and insurance companies are permitted t o own only a certain quantity of lowerquality bonds And many money market funds are allowed to have just of their assets in commercial paper that doesnt carry a top rating So when Moodys and SP downgraded Ford Motor s debt in October Gary Zeltzer head of investmentgrade fixed income at J W Seligman had no choice but to sell While Fords debt sold off on the downgrade it now trades at a better price than it did before And that brings us back to the Enron question How much should credit ratin gs anticipate the verdict of the stock market ONeill insists that his fir m cannot afford to rush to judgment it doesnt bother him at all he says if a bond trades at a different level than its rating implies The market tends to be much more nearterm focused We need to be diligent and make s ure we do our work Richard Waugh an analyst at the Principal Financial G roup agrees What the agencies do moves markets and affects the flow of capital So they have to make very sure that theyre right and they lean over backward to accomplish that But Moodys Rutherfurd has a different point of view If a credit is deter iorating we want to be the first to spot it he says He jumps up to an e asel looking very professorial to talk about the Merton modelbasicall y a way of incorporating the judgment of the equity market into ratings I n his view thats important because the equity market is forwardlooking whereas accounting data are reflective of the past We think were way ah ead of SP in doing this he boasts Nor does Rutherfurd seem to bristle a t the recent criticism I hate the word optimal he says But we do t he best we can and we think its pretty good That pretty good is likely to be as good as it getsbarring a few more E nroncaliber events the creditrating system

do you get A company that wasnt what it was cracked up to be Bethany McLean Additional Reporting by Nicholas Varchaver John Helyar Janice Revell and Jessica Sung Fortune Magazine Time Inc Copyright Our business is not a black box Its very simple to model People who rai se questions are people who have not gone through it in detail We have exp licit answers but people want to throw rocks at us So said Enrons thenCEO Jeff Skilling in an interview I had with him las t February At the timeless than ten months ago lets recallEnrons ma rket capitalization was around billion just a shade below its alltime high and its status as a Wall Street darling had not yet begun to crumble I was working on a story that would ultimately raise questions about Enro ns valuation and Id called with what I considered fairly standard querie s in an effort to understand its nearly incomprehensible financial statemen ts The response from Enron was anything but standard Skilling quickly bec ame frustrated said that the line of inquiry was unethical and hung up the phone A short time later Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer called and off ered to come to FORTUNEs New York City office with thenCFO Andy Fastow an d investorrelations head Mark Koenig We want to make sure weve answered your questions completely and accurately he said Now in the wake of Enrons stunning collapse it looks as if the companys critics didnt throw enough rocks The world is clamoring for those expli cit answers but Skilling long gone from Enron and avoiding the press o n the advice of his lawyersis in no position to provide them As for com pletely and accurately many would argue that the men running Enron never understood either concept One way to hide a log is to put it in the woods says Michigan Democrat John Dingell who is calling for a congressional investigation What were looking at here is an example of superbly comple x financial reports They didnt have to lie All they had to do was to obf uscate it with sheer complexityalthough they probably lied too Until recently Enron would kick and scream at the notion that its business or financial statements were complicated its attitude expressed with bare ly concealed disdain was that anyone who couldnt understand its business just didnt get it Many Wall Street analysts who followed the company we re content to go along Bulls including David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs admitted that they had to take the companys word on its numbersbut it wa snt a problem you see because Enron delivered what the Street most cared about smoothly growing earnings Of course now that its clear that thos e earnings werent what they appeared the new cliche is that Enrons busin ess was incredibly complicatedperhaps even too complicated for founder Ke n Lay to understand something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title from Skilling last summer Which leads to a basic question Why were so m any people willing to believe in something that so few actually understood Of course since the Enron collapse there are other basic questions as wel lquestions for which there are still no adequate answers Even today wit h creditors wrangling over Enrons skeletal remains while the company tries desperately to find a backer willing to keep its trading operations in bus iness outsiders still dont know what went wrong Neither do Enrons emplo yees many of whom expressed complete shock as their world cratered Was En rons ultimate collapse caused by a crisis of confidence in an otherwise so lid company Or were the sleazy financial dealings that precipitated that c risisincluding mysterious offbalancesheet partnerships run by Enron exe cutivesthe companys method of covering up even deeper issues in an effor t to keep the stock price rising And then theres the question thats been swirling around the business community and in Enrons hometown of Houston Given the extent to which financial chicanery appears to have take place is someone going to jail A CULTURE OF ARROGANCE If you believe the old saying that those whom the gods would destroy they first make proud perhaps this saga isnt so surprising Arrogant is the word everyone uses to describe Enron It was an attitude epitomized by the banner in Enrons lobby THE WORLDS LEADING COMPANY There was the compan ys powerful belief that older stodgier competitors had no chance against the sleek modern Enron juggernaut These big companies will topple over f rom their own weight Skilling said last year referring to oldeconomy be hemoths like Exxon Mobil A few years ago at a conference of utility execut ives Skilling told all the folks he was going to eat their lunch recall s Southern Co executive Dwight Evans People find that amusing today a dds Evans Or how about Skillings insistence last winter that the company s stockthen about a shareshould sell for a share Jim Alexand er the former CFO of Enron Global Power Pipelines which was spun off in once worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and sees similarities The co mmon theme is hubris an overweening pride which led people to believe the y can handle increasingly exotic risk without danger To be sure for a long time it seemed as though Enron had much to be arroga nt about The company which Ken Lay helped create in from the merger of two gas pipelines really was a pioneer in trading natural gas and elect ricity It really did build new markets for the trading of say weather fu tures For six years running it was voted Most Innovative among FORTUNEs Most Admired Companies Led by Skilling who had joined the company in from consulting firm McKinsey he succeeded Lay as CEO in February Enron operated under the belief that it could commoditize and monetize anyt hing from electrons to advertising space By the end of the decade Enron which had once made its money from hard assets like pipelines generated m ore than of its earnings from a vaguer business known as wholesale ene rgy operations and services From to Enrons revenues shot from billion to more than billion making it the seventhlargest compa ny on the FORTUNE And in early just as broadband was becoming a buzzword worth billions in market value Enron announced plans to trade tha t too But that culture had a negative side beyond the inbred arrogance Greed was evident even in the early days More than anywhere else they talked abo ut how much money we would make says someone who worked for Skilling Com pensation plans often seemed oriented toward enriching executives rather th an generating profits for shareholders For instance in Enrons energy ser vices division which managed the energy needs of large companies like Eli Lilly executives were compensated based on a market valuation formula that relied on internal estimates As a result says one former executive ther e was pressure to in effect inflate the value of the contractseven thou gh it had no impact on the actual cash that was generated Because Enron believed it was leading a revolution it encouraged flouting the rules There was constant gossip that this rule breaking extended to ex ecutives personal livesrumors of sexual high jinks in the executive rank s ran rampant Enron also developed a reputation for ruthlessness both ext ernal and internal Skilling is usually credited with creating a system of forced rankings for employees in which those rated in the bottom would leave the company Thus employees attempted to crush not just outsiders b ut each other Enron was built to maximize value by maximizing the individ ual parts says an executive at a competing energy firm Enron traders he adds were afraid to go to the bathroom because the guy sitting next to th em might use information off their screen to trade against them And becaus e delivering bad news had careerwrecking potential problems got papered o verespecially says one former employee in the trading operation Peopl e perpetuated this myth that there were never any mistakes It was astoundi ng to me TRADING SECRETS Were not a trading company said Fastow during that February visit We are not in the business of making money by speculating He also pointed ou t that over the past five years Enron had reported straight quarters of increasing income Theres not a trading company in the world that has th at kind of consistency he said Thats the check at the end of the day In fact its next to impossible to find someone outside Enron who agrees w ith Fastows contention They were not an energy company that used trading as a part of their strategy but a company that traded for tradings sake says Austin Ramzy research director of Principal Capital Income Investor s Enron is dominated by pure trading says one competitor Indeed Enron had a reputation for taking more risk than other companies especially in longerterm contracts in which there is far less liquidity Enron swung f or the fences says another trader And its no secret that among non inv estment banks Enron was an active and extremely aggressive player in compl ex financial instruments such as credit derivatives Because Enron didnt h ave as strong a balance sheet as the investment banks that dominate that wo rld it had to offer better prices to get business Funky is a word that is used to describe its trades But theres an obvious explanation for why Enron didnt want to disclose th e extent to which it was a trading company For Enron it was all about the price of the stock and trading companies with their inherently volatile earnings simply arent rewarded with rich valuations Look at Goldman Sach s One of the best trading outfits in the world its stock rarely sells for more than times earnings vs the or so multiple that Enron shares c ommanded at their peak Youll never hear Goldmans management predicting t he precise amount it will earn next yearyet Enrons management predicted earnings practically to the penny The odd mismatch between what Enrons ma nagement said and what others say isnt just an academic debate The questi on goes to the heart of Enrons valuation which was based on its ability t o generate predictable earnings Why didnt that disconnect seem to matter Because like Enrons management investors cared only about the stock price too And as long as Enron poste d the earnings it promised and talked up big ideas like broadband the st ock price was supposed to keep on rising as indeed it did for a while Institutions like Janus Fidelity and Alliance Capital piled in Of course earnings growth isnt the entire explanation for Wall Streets attitude There were also the enormous investmentbanking fees Enron generated Nor w as asking questions easy Wall Streeters find it hard to admit that they do nt understand something And Skilling was notoriously short with those who didnt immediately concur with the Enron worldview If you didnt act li ke a light bulb came on pretty quick Skilling would dismiss you says one portfolio manager They had Wall Street beaten into submission he adds WHERE ARE THE PROFITS Although its hard to pinpoint the exact moment the tide began to turn agai nst Enron its not hard to find the person who first said that the emperor had no clothes In early Jim Chanos who runs Kynikos Associates a highly regarded firm that specializes in short selling said publicly what now seems obvious No one could explain how Enron actually made money Cha nos also pointed out that while Enrons business seemed to resemble nothing so much as a hedge fund a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline in the memorable words of Doug Millett Kynikos chief operating officer it simply didnt make very much money Enrons operating margin had plung ed from around in early to under by early and its return o n invested capital hovered at a figure that does not include Enrons of fbalancesheet debt which as we now know was substantial I wouldnt p ut my money in a hedge fund earning a return scoffed Chanos who also pointed out that Skilling was aggressively selling shareshardly the behav ior of someone who believed his stock was really worth Not only was Enron surprisingly unprofitable but its cash flow from operat ions seemed to bear little relationship to reported earnings Because much of Enrons business was booked on a mark to market basis in which a comp any estimates the fair value of a contract and runs quarterly fluctuations through the income statement reported earnings didnt correspond to the ac tual cash coming in the door That isnt necessarily badas long as the ca sh shows up at some point But over time Enrons operations seemed to consu me a lot of cash onbalancesheet debt climbed from billion in t o billion at last report Skilling and Fastow had a simple explanation for Enrons low returns The distorting factor in Fastows words was Enrons huge investments in inte rnational pipelines and plants reaching from India to Brazil Skilling told analysts that Enron was shedding those underperforming oldline assets as quickly as it could and that the returns in Enrons newer businesses were m uch much higher Its undeniable that Enron did make a number of big bad bets on overseas projectsin fact India and Brazil are two good examples But in truth no one on the outside and few people inside Enron can inde pendently measure how profitableor more to the point how consistently pr ofitableEnrons trading operations really were A former employee says th at Skilling and his circle refused to detail the return on capital that the trading business generated instead pointing to reported earnings just as Fastow did By the late s much of Enrons asset portfolio had been lum ped in with its trading operations for reporting purposes Chanos noted tha t Enron was selling those assets and booking them as recurring revenue In addition Enron took equity stakes in all kinds of companies and included r esults from those investments in the figures it reported Chanos was also the first person to pay attention to the infamous partnersh ips In poring over Enron documents he took note of an odd and opaque ment ion of transactions that Enron and other Entities had done with a Relate d Party that was run by a senior officer of Enron Not only was it impos sible to understand what that meant but it also raised a conflictofinter est issue given that an Enron senior executiveCFO Fastow as it turns ou tran the Related Party entities These we now know refer to the LJM p artnerships When it came to the Related Party transactions Enron didnt even pretend to be willing to answer questions Back in February Fastow who at the ti me didnt admit his involvement said that the details were confidential because Enron didnt want information to get into the market Then he exp lained that the partnerships were used for unbundling and reassembling th e various components of a contract We strip out price risk we strip out interest rate risk we strip out all the risks he said Whats left may not be something that we want The obvious question is Why would anyone e lse want whatever was left either But perhaps that didnt matter because the partnerships were supported with Enron stockwhich you remember wasn t supposed to decline in value SKILLING SENDS A SIGNAL By midAugust enough questions had been raised about Enrons credibility th at the stock had begun falling it had dropped from at the beginning of the year to the low s And then came what should have been the clearest signal yet of serious problems Jeff Skillings shocking announcement that he was leaving the company Though Skilling never gave a plausible reason f or his departure Enron dismissed any suggestion that his departure was rel ated to possible problems with the company Now however there are those w ho speculate that Skilling knew the falling stock price would wreak havoc o n the partnershipsand cause their exposure He saw what was coming and he didnt have the emotional fortitude to deal with it says a former empl oyee Whats astonishing is that even in the face of this dramaticand largely i nexplicableevent people were still willing to take Enron at its word Ke n Lay who stepped back into his former role as CEO retained immense credi bility on Wall Street and with Enrons older employees who gave him a stan ding ovation at a meeting announcing his return He said there were no acc ounting issues trading issues or reserve issues at Enron and people bel ieved him Lay promised to restore Enrons credibility by improving its dis closure practices which he finally admitted had been less than adequate Did Lay have any idea of what he was talking about Or was he as clueless a s Enrons shareholders Most people believe the latter But even when Lay c learly did know an important piece of information he seemed to be more inc lined to bury it Enronstyle than to divulge it After all Enrons now i nfamous Oct press releasethe one that really marked the beginning of the end in which it announced a million loss but failed to mention th at it had written down shareholders equity by a stunning billionwen t out under Lays watch And Lay failed to mention a critical fact on the s ubsequent conference call that Moodys was considering a downgrade of Enro ns debt Although Skilling said last February that Enrons offbalance s heet debt was nonrecourse to Enron it turns out that that wasnt quite true either Under certain circumstances including a downgrade of Enrons onbalancesheet debt below investment grade Enron could be forced to repa y it Indeed facing a now nearly constant barrage of criticism Enron seemed to retreat further and further from Lays promises of full disclosure The rat her vague reason that Enron first gave for that huge reduction in sharehold ers equity was the early termination of the LJM partnerships That was f ar from enough to satisfy investors especially as the Wall Street Journal began to ferret out pieces of information related to the partnerships incl uding the fact that Fastow had been paid millions for his role at the LJMs As recently as Oct Lay insisted that Enron had access to cash that t he business was performing very well and that Fastow was a standup guy w ho was being unnecessarily smeared The very next day Enron announced that Fastow would take a leave of absence We now know of course that Enrons dealings with its various related part ies had a huge impact on the earnings it reported On Nov an eyepoppin g document told investors that Enron was restating its earnings for the pas t years because three unconsolidated entities should have been conso lidated in the financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounti ng principles The restatement reduced earnings by almost million or about and contained a warning that Enron could still find additional or different information And sophisticated investors who have scrutinized the list of selected trans actions between Enron and its various partnerships are still left with more questions than answers The speculation is that the partnerships were used to even out Enrons earnings Which leads to another set of questions If Enron had ceased its game playing and come completely clean would the comp any have survived Or did Enron fail to come clean precisely because the re al story would have been even more scandalous THE LAST GASP On the surface the facts that led to Enrons Dec bankruptcy filing are quite straightforward For a few weeks it looked as if Dynegy which had lo ng prided itself on being the antiEnron would bail out its flailing rival by injecting it with an immediate billion in cash secured by an opti on on Enrons key pipeline Northern Natural Gas and then purchasing all o f Enron for roughly billion not including debt But by Nov the de al had fallen apart On that day Standard Poors downgraded Enrons debt below investment grade triggering the immediate repayment of almost bil lion in offbalancesheet debtwhich Enron couldnt pay But even this denouement comes with its own set of plot twists Both compan ies are suing each other Enron claims that Dynegy wrongfully terminated th e deal consistently took advantage of Enrons precarious state to further its own business goals and as a result has no right to Enrons Northern Natural pipeline Dynegy calls Enrons suit one more example of Enrons fa ilure to take responsibility for its demise No one can predict how the su its will pan out but one irony is clear Enron that neweconomy superstar is battling to hang on to its very oldeconomy pipeline To hear Dynegy tell it a central rationale for abandoning the deal was wha t might be called the mystery of the missing cash General counsel Ken Rand olph says that Dynegy expected Enron to have some billion in cashbut a n Enron filing revealed just over billion We went back to Enron and we asked Where did the cash go Where did the cash go says CEO Chuck Wa tson Perhaps their core business was not as strong as they had led us to believe speculates Randolph Dynegy also claims that Enron tried to keep secrets to the last Enrons lack of cash was revealed to the world in a fi ling on the afternoon of Monday Nov Watson says he got the document o nly a few hours earlierbut that Lay had a copy on Friday I was not happ y says Watson Its not good form to surprise your partner Sagas like this one inevitably wind up in the courtsand Enrons is no exc eption Given that creditrating agency Fitch estimates that even senior un secureddebt holders will get only to of their money back the batt les among Enrons various creditors are likely to be fierce Nor has Enron itself conceded yet The companys biggest lenders JP Morgan Chase and C itigroup have extended billion of debtor in possession financing to Enron which will enable it to continue to operate at least for a while A nd Enron is still searching for a bank that will back it in restarting its trading business In the meantime the courts will also be trying to answer a key question W ho should pay Enrons Chapter filing automatically freezes all suits ag ainst the company itself while the bankruptcy is resolved But while Enron may seek the same protection for its executives lawyers predict that the a ttempt will fail and that the individuals will have to fend off a raft of s uits Some think that criminal charges are a possibility for former executi ves like Skilling and Fastow But such cases require proof of knowing wil lful intentional misconduct says wellknown defense attorney Ira Sorkin And a criminal case requires a much higher standard of proof than a civil case proof beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a preponderance of the ev idence Thats a high bar especially since Enron executives will probably claim that they had Enrons auditor Arthur Andersen approving their every move With Enron in bankruptcy Arthur Andersen is now the deepest availab le pocket and the shareholder suits are already piling up In any conversation about Enron the comparison with LongTerm Capital Mana gement invariably crops up In some ways it looks as if the cost of the En ron debacle is far less than that of LTCMfar less than anyone would have thought possible in fact see next story But in other ways the cost is f ar greater Enron was a public company with employees and shareholders who counted on management the board and the auditors to protect them Thats why one senior Wall Streeter says of the Enron saga It disgusts me and i t frightens me And thats why regardless of how the litigation plays out it feels as though a crime has been committed FEEDBACK Additional reporting by Nicholas Varchaver John Helyar Janice Revell and Jessica Sung Quote Among the still unanswered questions swirling around Enron is

FeaturesThe Recovery Will The Economy Get Well Soon The Fed has been slashing rates with a ve ngeance but a credit squeeze could really hurt the recovery Anna Bernasek Fortune Magazine Time Inc Copyright When it comes to recessions economists believe in a simple rule of thumb Pump money and credit into an ailing economy and before long you have a re covery The bigger the injection the stronger the rebound So between Alan Greenspans yearlong campaign to slash interest rates and the governments latest stimulus package totaling billion we should get one mindblow ing recovery right After all the last time we pumped so much money into the economy was in the early s and things turned out pretty groovy bac k then Unfortunately it may not be so simple this time Eight months into this re cession consumers are still buying bigticket items like cars and homes W hile that has kept the economy from totally tanking it leaves little pent up consumer demand to drive a fast recovery So its all up to corporate Am ericawhich youll recall got us into this mess in the first place As M ark Zandi chief economist of Economycom puts it The difference between a strong recovery and a disappointing one will depend on business investme nt And on that score theres cause for concern if not outright agita Most w orrying are early signs of a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on corporat e lending If that continues the recovery may not be right around the corn er as many economists are now predicting or if it is it wont feel like much of one Heres whats going on Since the terrorist attacks of Sept many banks have turned hypercautio us According to the Federal Reserves survey of senior loan officers the most comprehensive picture of banks willingness to lend of domestic b anks restricted their lending in October up from in August Foreign ba nks became just as wary and the tougher credit conditions are affecting fi rms of all sizes across the country Weve become more conservative in our lending admits George Andrews president of Capitol City Bank Trust in Atlanta Were turning down customers we would have lent to a year ago Banks are making it tougher for business to borrow in other ways too Accor ding to the same Fed survey more than half of domestic banks in October ra ised the rate they charge on riskier corporate loans At the same time a g rowing number of banks have imposed more stringent loan covenants and colla teral requirements on large and mediumsized companies All this took place even as the Fed was slashing shortterm interest rates to stimulate busine ss investment Indeed as well see later what should be one of the best t imes ever to borrow money isnt turning out that way at all for most compan ies Theres one notable exceptionlarge wellknown firms have taken adva ntage of a bonanza in the corporate bond marketyet here too that borrow ing window seems to be closing as the market for commercial paper for exam ple has dried up So whats making banks so jittery Blame Osama Jay Sidhu CEO of Sovereign Bank in Pennsylvania says Sept introduced a lot more uncertainty for corporate earnings leading banks to worry about the quality of loans Sud denly a firm that expected sales of X was not going to achieve that and it made us more cautious he explains I think the majority of banks reacte d in the same way Now Sidhu is looking for tangible improvement in the ec onomy before hes willing to lend freely In particular hes closely watch ing consumer confidence employment and investment in technology for signs of a sustained rebound Once Sidhu becomes less squeamish other bankers probably wont be far behi nd Bankers are herdlike in their behavior says Zandi Theyve trained in the same way go to the same conferences and talk to one another so wh en one bank makes a change the others follow The trouble is even when b anks become more optimistic theres a lag effect before easier credit bene fits the economy Researchers at the New York Fed have found that it can ta ke at least three months from the time banks increase the availability of c redit to when firms spend the funds So how bad could it get Think back to the last time banks lost their nerve the early s Although its hard to remember anything negative happeni ng at all during the s nirvana we did experience a fullblown credit c runch at the start of the decade Thats the reason the recovery from the recession felt so lackluster In fact the media dubbed it the jobl ess recovery because firms simply couldnt get the funds they needed from banks to expand operations and hire more staff At the time remember bank s were saddled with bad loans following a commercial property bust Happily thats not the case today Right now we dont have anything like the rea l estate crisis of the late s says Richard Berner Morgan Stanleys ch ief US economist Its not about a problem with capital but with confide nce Still another corporate collapse a la Enron and banks might find th eir capital base isnt as strong as they thought Thats one of the things about economic slumps Loan quality can deteriorate virtually overnight While we may well avoid a Grade A credit crunch this recession its clear we wont return to the days of easy money that financed the boom of the s anytime soon The main reason is that the conditions for business investm ent arent nearly as ideal as they were in the s As the recovery got u nder way back then Washington was reducing the federal budget deficit whi ch brought longterm interest rates down steadily Today we face the opposi te situation The surplus has vanished and the prospect of mounting defici ts is fast becoming reality Thats one reason longterm interest rates hav e hardly budged this year although official short term rates plunged from to Since Greenspan started cutting rates in January year bond yields have edged down from to a mere and tenyear yields went from to While the talk on Wall Street is all about recovery with markets staging a dramatic rally since their postSept lows the business environment re mains grimprofit margins are at year lows theres excess capacity at every turn and aggressive price discounting is rampant Not exactly the be st combination to encourage firms to invest now is it And thats reflecte d in the latest figures which show that the steep decline in business inve stment that began a

unique The major survivin g energy traders including American Electric Power Duke Dynegy Mirant and Reliant argue that unlike Enron they possess major physical assets like power plants and storage facilities that balance the risks inherent in trading Ironically just a year ago those companies emphasized their trading prowes s today the spin is that trading is merely a way to maximize the value of hard assets Our business model is fundamentally different from Enrons says Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom We dont do nearly the volume of tr ading Enron did and we also produce power and control natural gas Enron h ad gotten out of the energy business and was essentially a financial servic es company that happened to make markets in electricity and natural gas E ven so Dynegy faces more risk than its competitors For starters says CSF B analyst Curt Launer Dynegy derives more of its earnings and cash flow fr om marketing and trading than do companies that are more akin to traditiona l utilities In addition Enron is suing Dynegy for billion as a result of the failed merger Although the suit has little chance of succeeding a ny adverse legal decisions would immediately push Dynegys stock price down On the other hand says Launer Dynegys shares have more upside potentia l if and when the energy sector comes back into favor Mirants CFO Ray Hill is especially eager to put some daylight between his company and Enron We have billion in assets and megawatts of g enerating power across the country he says One wall of our trading floo r shows the status of every plant and almost all our trading is driven by our own assets So if I sell power forward six months or a year I can prod uce it if I need to In addition says Hill Mirants internal controls ba r traders from putting more than million of capital at risk each day T hats a small fraction of Mirants shareholder equity currently billi on or its annual profits projected to be nearly million in At the end of every day the CEO and I both get a report showing exactly how much capital is at risk Hill says Still executives from Mirant and other companies are taking great pains to tell investors just how their businesses work Last month Mirant CEO Marce Fuller spent an hour and a half taking analysts in Atlanta and New York th rough each line of Mirants balance sheet This isnt a topic that would h ave been included in an analysts meeting in the past but theres going to be a lot more pressure on companies like ourselves to help people understa nd how we make money says Fuller Duke Energys group president of energy services Harvey Padewer agrees Weve been very open with the Street N o one ever considered Duke a black box It will be a while before energy trading companieseven those with substan tial assetsregain the trust they had before the Enron debacle Fuller say s that while Mirant has already signed several profitable deals to sell gas for former Enron clients getting fresh capital to build new power plants or make acquisitions is much harder than it was six months ago That has ca used Mirant to slow capital expenditures and delay some new investments T heres still a lot of nervousness that something else is out there admits Fuller Larger sophisticated players with real assets like Mirant Dyneg y and Reliant will do just fine But the capital markets think if Enron ca n go down who

Copyright Forbes Inc On a cool day in Houston early last month Dynegy chief Charles Watson anno unced the boldest deal of his career In years he had built the natural gas producer into a powerhouse but he chafed in the shadow of his far bigg er hometown rival Enron Corp and its chairman the silvertongued Kennet h Lay Lays swagger personified the freewheeling energytrading markets a nd Enron dominated the action but now the titan was reeling from allegatio ns of dirty selfdealing a raft of sudden resignations and an SEC investig ation Valued at billion only months before Enron was teetering on the brink of collapse So Chuck Watson declared he would rescue his rival at an especially sweet price just billion in Dynegy stock Watson was sure the skeptics on Enr on were wrong and that with a few problems solved Enron was still a rockso lid money machine Its revenue grew in the third quarter to billion more than one and a half times what Dynegy generated in all of For a firesale price he boasted Dynegy would suddenly expand sixfold into a billionayear giant with billion in assets The supercharged firm would handle as much as onequarter of US energy trading After operatin g in obscurity for years Dynegy suddenly would become the secondlargest c orporation in America in salesa worldclass energy merchant by anyones definition Watson proclaimed Two weeks later Watsons triumph ended in epic failure He scuttled his dre am deal after getting surprised by a string of horrifying financial revelat ions at Enron The big rivals market cap had continued to plunge falling to a level so lowless than millionas to make Watson look like a su cker for ever offering billion Enron clearly was headed for Chapter or even liquidation The merger was off and the recriminations and lawsui ts were just beginning I was very disappointed Watson says in characteristic laconic understat ement He also was furious Enron had tumbled into turmoil by misleading in vestors and now it was misrepresenting its finances yet againso says Wat sonand laying the blame on Dynegy I just hope the other side doesnt th ink all this spinning which got them into trouble to begin with is going to get them out of it he fumes In the fallout Enron struggles to stay alive and Watson can count his ble ssings In retreating he has dodged Enrons billion in debt the dark cloud of the investigation now under way by the Securities Exchange Commi ssion the devastated trading floor and a thicket of lawsuits and liabiliti es so massive and murky that they could end up burying everyone in sight I nstead Watson is setting up the next chapter at Dynegy He took it over in with a investment and a stake for himself building it into a firm with a billion market value as of Nov With now hes wo rth half a billion Watson vows to make Dynegy even bigger even better and an undisputed lead er in a gunshy industry that has lost the stability and swagger of its onc edominant progenitor Enron Dynegy says it can grow at least next yea r to billion in revenue The death of Enron is a mixed blessing for Chuck Watson Some of Enrons bu siness and some of its brightest people will wind up at his firm if he get s his way in court Watson will also get Enrons valuable pipeline system N orthern Natural Gas in return for the billion he poured into Enron in the course of the merger plans The negative litigation Enron is threate ning to sue Dynegy for backing out of the merger and Enrons creditors are sure to pile on at some point Even without swallowing the bigger Enron Dynegy is a leading processor of natural gas and one of the top three transporters on every interstate pipel ine in North America Its power plants generate megawatts of electri city enough for a city of million In the commodity derivatives markets where suppliers and utilities lock in future prices Dynegy is a top trade r in natural gas power coal emission credits and weather derivatives Bu t these volatile trading businesses which contributed of Enrons alleg ed earnings but ultimately could not make up for its blunders elsewhere ar e merely a healthy sideline at Dynegy contributing only of earnings And Watson may yet have a multibilliondollar merger in his future Big riv als such as American Electric Power Duke Energy and Reliant outmuscle Dyne gy in some markets making them attractive partners He expresses keen inte rest in doing more deals having made nine acquisitions since which h as kept Dynegys top line growing a hefty a year Last year its stock j umped the secondbest performance in the SP Even on the day Wat son bailed out of buying Enron he inked a million purchase of another outfit BG Storage Hes a gambler whose winning streak might not have end ed Enron and Dynegy were born the same yearbut took very different pat hs Ken Lay started out with billion in revenues from the merger of two energy companies Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth Then he won fame and accolades for transforming a stodgy old gas business into a sexy wheelerd ealer doing for energy what Nasdaq did for stocks creating a highly liqui d overthecounter market for all kinds of contracts In the process he s lapped Enrons name on a new sports stadium and hobnobbed with the likes of Dick Cheney and George W Bush Chuck Watson started out with far less Dynegy began life under the unpromi sing name of the US Natural Gas Clearinghouse a marketing arm jointly ow ned by six pipeline companies Morgan Stanley and the law firm Akin Gump N or was Watson some headhunters superstar He began his career as a lowly t rainee at Conoco Even after Dynegy hit the big leagues Watsons awshucks manner kept him out of the public eye he frequently says hed rather let his customers talk up Dynegy than do it himself Flashy no but competitiv e hell yes He is so fierce a warrior on the links that when he was recove ring from an Achilles tendon injury recently he borrowed an oversize golf shoe to fit it over his sore swollen foot rather than miss combat in ho les Always scrappy and still athletic at Watson was born in Great Lakes Il l one of four children of a salesman who hawked space in industrial parks The family moved around a lot and Watson attended schools in nine stat es Sports let him fit in quickly He was driving for a college basketball scholarship until he seriously injured his back in a car wreck as a high sc hool senior in Ft Smith Ark On graduating from Oklahoma State in h e took a job with Conoco in Ponca City Okla so he could stay close to his college sweetheart Kim who now has been married to him for years The summer job turned fulltime and in the next years Watson worked his wa y up at Conoco to the middling title of sales director It was natural gas was on the verge of revolution and Watson wanted to be in the vanguard A lot of people in this business were scared by der egulation he recalls I was excited by the opportunities Opportunity a rrived in the form of the slappedtogether US Natural Gas Clearinghouse Watson first turned down the job It looked unworkable The pipeline compan ies might try to force the fledgling firm to do business only with their ow n pipelines how would he push them aside His suitors kept wooing him off ering a sizable raise and finally Watson relented with one condition Do nt pay me a salarygive me of the company He got both the equity i nitially taking the form of phantom stockin effect a longterm option On Watsons first day on the job only of the employees borrowed from the parent firms showed up He told the noshows not to come back Later th at year he bought out the stakes from the pipelines for each and t hen he got Akin Gump to sell leaving Morgan as sole shareholder His visio n was clear from day one Hundreds of brokers were jumping in many armed w ith just a phone and a Rolodex Competing with them was a losing game Supp liers and buyers would eventually get each others phone numbers and one d ay the fat middleman spreads that Watsons shop relied on would evaporate Then what With the backing of Morgan Stanley and a surfeit of underground salt domes for gas storage Watson figured he could buy gas at wellheads and deliver i t when and where customers wanted holding it for them when they didnt nee d it and serving it up when demand surged This meant Watson would assume t he risk of holding gas that might tumble in price but any trader could han dle that risk with some artful hedges The startup was barely making payroll when Watson arrived turning a sale a week and celebrating each with a round of cigars Watson nixed the cigars and started turning multiple sales a day He worked his contacts and had st aff coldcalling corporate gas users to drum up business By Morgan Stanley wanted out and sold the company for million The buyers were three energy companies British Gas Nova and Chevron and emp loyees Morgan was happy with its tidy profit Had it held on its stake wo uld be worth billion Meanwhile Ken Lay at Enron was discovering the same potential in gas tradin g Deregulation had left producers and utilities at the mercy of volatile s pot prices Lay began writing longterm contracts to buy or sell gas at fix ed prices Business grew more stable at both ends of the pipeline Eventual ly the raw trading of these contractsrather than delivering on thembeca me Enrons mainstay In the mids electricity joined gas on the deregulatory path Watson wa nted in but needed currency So in he bought Trident a publicly held ethylene producer the reverse merger gave him new access to money in the c apital markets The following fall Watson cut a deal with Chevron to sell the oil giants entire North American gas output the first such exclusive marketing deal It was precisely what Watson had in mind all along The gas producer receives market prices at its wells Watson takes ownership tran sports stores and delivers the energy at a markup He compares the approac h to that of grain trader Cargill Business was booming but Watson wanted to buy a lot more gas processing pl ants and electric power plants The problem was in raising the cash Dynegy had a public currency but was now in the hands of employees and three institutions There wasnt enough of a float to attract institutional shar eholders So Watson walked into a meeting of his owners in Scotland in with a blunt message We have a problem Its in this room Two of you ha ve to go I dont care which Then he walked out Nova and British Gas exi ted The companys float went to overnight The next year Watson change d Natural Gas Clearinghouses name to Dynegy excising an r to dodge a pr eexisting British claim Then he used his stock to make his boldest push ye t into power Illinova an Illinois generating firm was nearly insolvent Watson bought it for a pittance Enron was having a field day with deregulation too Instead of buying elec tricity from a plant and selling it elsewhere for a tiny cut it began carv ing output into pieces much as Wall Street slices Treasurys into Treasury strips Enron would guarantee a utility running a distribution grid all the power it would need on a hot summer afternoon An aluminum smelter would p ay half as much but suffer some interruptions As Enrons confidence grew its trades got more exotic involving derivativ es on pulp metals pollution

cash into its trading business while the debt and lossesmoved off its books The questions started getting prickly when Enrons stock price fell in the spring Its business of trading fiberoptic capacity with revenues of more than million in lost million in the first half of as sales plunged In midAugust Skilling abruptly quit Speculation was that s omething was seriously amiss Then on Oct Enron set a billion third quarter charge related to a partnership linked to Chief Financial Officer A ndrew Fastow plus a billion reduction in shareholder equity due to a ccounting errors Rumors were rampant that trading partners were avoiding Enron and that it was on the brink of a credit downgrade that would force i t to immediately repay billion in debt pushing it into bankruptcy On Oct Dynegy President

mentions of Enron in fi ve yearssix times as many as for Dynegy For all their folksiness Dynegy execs were talking trash about Enron for y ears Off the record they questioned Enrons assertions it held balanced books of commitments to buy and sell commodities and suggested their rival was laying risky bets on the direction of gas and electricity prices Investment bankers came in to do the paperwork Dynegy merger chief Hugh Ta rpley an alum of Notre Dame coined the de rigeur code names Dynegy was t he heroic Rockne Enron fittingly was the Gipperthe dying football play er Watson meanwhile was

underlings made excuses On the last day of the tournament som eone noticed Watson heading toward the course in a golf cart wearing busine ss shoes a clue that he was headed for merger talks he feigned forgetfuln ess Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty meanwhile was poring over Enrons fin ancials and feeling fine We got a lot of comfort that the core business w as operating well and capable of generating great cash flow Doty recalls But ChevronTexaco which owns of Dynegy scrutinized the deal and aske dwhy not wait for Enron to fall into bankruptcy and buy it at a distress sale In the end Chevron put billion into Dynegy which used it to buy of the preferred stock in the Enron unit that owns its prized Norther n Natural Gas pipeline That along with billion more at the mergers cl ose was expected to give Enron the liquidity it needed Watson unveiled his daring rescue plan on Friday Nov reserving the rig ht to call off the deal if Enrons liabilities rose or profits fell below certain levels His hole card a clause stating Dynegys billion inve stment gave it the right to keep the big pipeline even if the deal was abor ted There was a lot we didnt know he admits but we thought wed adeq uately protected our shareholders Dynegys stock had a quick runup o n news of the bid If Skilling is to go down in history books for his hubris Watson should ge t a mention too JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup offered to inject mi llion or more in equity capital into Enron Watson confident that Enrons hemorrhaging was over brushed aside the offer The euphoria faded fast On Nov Enron filed quarterly financials that h eld two bombshells Recent credit downgrades to a notch above junk had put Enron on the hook to repay million to a partnership in just a weekso mething Enron had never warned Dynegy about Whats more Enron had bill ion less in cash on hand than it was supposed to have Watson was stunned Enron had provided a peek at the numbers two weeks befo re but none of this was disclosed Enron has disputed this Watson says t hat Dynegy got the full filing just three hours before it was made public a nd that only then did he know his deal was in trouble What else had Enron failed to disclose Negotiations went on even as Enron shares fell to an d lower On Nov three credit agencies downgraded Enron to junk status That morning Watson called Lay and killed the deal Lay was

Poors Corp but it still h as a huge effect In recent days the scale of that financial damage has become clearer The result could well be tighter credit for many companies just as Europes eco nomy softens Spreads in the corporate fixed income market widened by up to basis points between Nov and Dec Adding to the pressure is the fear that there is more risk in the credit markets than was realized We didnt know Enron but lent on the back of its credit rating says Profum o As Enron sank he adds the first question I asked my colleagues was What is the value of a rating Just a few months ago the parent compan y had an AA rating from the main agencies Its now rated as junk Banks arent the only ones affected Enron stock and bonds were widely held by European mutual funds and insurers

NETZHAUT Cover Story THE FALL OF ENRON How exCEO Jeff Skillings strategy grew so complex that even his boss couldnt get a handle on it By Wendy Zellner and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas with Emily Thornto n Peter Coy Heather Timmons Louis Lavelle and David Henry in New York and bureau reports BusinessWeek Copyright McGrawHill Inc To former Enron CEO Jeffrey K Skilling there were two kinds of people in the world those who got it and those who didnt It was Enrons comple x strategy for minting rich profits and returns from a trading and riskman agement business built essentially on assets owned by others Vertically in tegrated behemoths like ExxonMobil Corp whose balance sheet was rich with oil reserves gas stations and other assets were dinosaurs to a contempt uous Skilling In the old days people worked for the assets Skilling mused in an interview last January Weve turned it aroundwhat weve sa id is the assets work for the people But who looks like Tyrannosaurus Rex now As Enron Corp struggles to salva ge something from the nations largest bankruptcy case filed on Dec it s clear that the real Enron was a far cry from the nimble asset light market maker that Skilling proclaimed And the financial maneuvering and of fbalancesheet partnerships that he and exChief Financial Officer Andrew S Fastow perfected to remove everything from telecom fiber to water compan ies from Enrons debtheavy balance sheet helped spark the companys implos ion Jeffs theory was assets were bad intellectual capital was good says one former senior executive Employees readily embraced the rhetoric the executive says but they didnt understand how it was funded Neither did many others Bankers stock analysts auditors and Enrons own board failed to comprehend the risks in this heavily leveraged trading gia nt Enrons bankruptcy filings show billion in debt for the parent co mpany and an additional billion for affiliates But that doesnt incl ude at least billion more estimated to exist off the balance sheet Ken neth L Lay who had nurtured Skilling as his successor sparked t he first wave of panic when he revealed in an Oct conference call with analysts that deals involving partnerships run by his CFO would knock billion off shareholder equity Lay who had been out of daytoday managem ent for years was never able to clearly explain how the partnerships worke d or why anyone shouldnt assume the worstthat they were set up to hide E nrons problems inflate earnings and personally benefit the executives wh o managed some of them That uncertainty ultimately scuttled Enrons best hope for a rescue its de al to be acquired by its smaller but healthier rival Dynegy Inc Now Enron is frantically seeking a rocksolid banking partner to help maintain some shred of its oncemighty trading empire Already Enron workers in Ho uston have lost their jobs And hundreds of creditors from banks to teleco ms to construction companies are trying to recover part of the billions th eyre owed From the beginning Lay had a vision for Enron that went far beyond that of a traditional energy company When Lay formed Enron from the merger of two pipeline companies in he understood that deregulation of the busines s would offer vast new opportunities To exploit them he turned to Skillin g then a McKinsey Co consultant Skilling was the chief nutsandbolts operator from until his departure last summer and the architect of an increasingly byzantine financial structure After he abruptly quit in Augu st citing personal reasons and his righthand financier Fastow was ousted Oct there was no one left to explain it Much of the blame for Enrons collapse has focused on the partnerships but the seeds of its destruction were planted well before the October surprise s According to former insiders and other sources close to Enron it was al ready on shaky financial ground from a slew of bad investments including o verseas projects ranging from a water business in England to a power distri butor in Brazil You make enough billiondollar mistakes and they add up says one source close to Enrons top executives In June Standard Po ors analysts put the company on notice that its underperforming internatio nal assets were of growing concern But SP which like BusinessWeek is a u nit of The McGrawHill companies ultimately reaffirmed the credit ratings based on Enrons apparent willingness to sell assets and take other steps Behind all the analyses of Enron was the assumption that the core energy bu siness was thriving It was still growing rapidly but margins were inevita bly coming down as the market matured Once that growth slowed any weakn ess would start becoming more apparent says Standard Poors Corp dire ctor Todd A Shipman They were not the best at watching their cost In deed the tight risk controls that seemed to work well in the trading busin ess apparently didnt apply to other parts of the company Skillings answer to growing competition in energy trading was to push Enro ns innovative techniques into new arenas everything from broadband to met als steel and even advertising time and space Skilling knew he had to fi nd a way to finance his big growth plans and manage the international probl ems without killing the companys critical investmentgrade credit rating Without a clever solution trading partners would flee or the cost of doin g deals would become insurmountable HES HEARTBROKEN No one ever disp uted that Skilling was clever The Pittsburghborn son of a sales manager f or an Illinois valve company he took over as production director at a star tup Aurora Ill TV station at age when an older staffer quit and he wa s the only one who knew how to operate the equipment Skilling landed a ful ltuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to study e ngineering but quickly changed to business After graduation he went to w ork for a Houston bank The bank later went bust while Skilling was at Harv ard Business School Skilling said that fiasco made him determined to keep strict risk controls on Enrons trading business He once told BusinessWeek that Ive never not been successful in business or work ever Skillin g now declines to comment but his brother Tom a Chicago TV weatherman sa ys of him Hes heartbroken over whats going on there We were not ra ised to look on these kinds of things absent emotion Enrons intellectual capital was Skillings pride and joy He recruited more than newly minted MBAs each year from the nations top business s chools Meteorologists and PhDs in math and economics helped analyze and mo del the vast amounts of data that Enron used in its trading operations A f orced ranking system weeded out the poor performers It was as competitiv e internally as it was externally says one former executive It was no surprise then that Skilling would turn to a bright young finance wizard Fastow to help him find capital for his rapidly expanding empire Boasting an MBA from Northwestern University Fastow was recruited to Enron in from Continental Bank where he worked on leveraged buyouts Artic ulate handsome and mature beyond his years he became Enrons CFO at age In October he earned CFO Magazines CFO Excellence Award for Cap ital Structure Management An effusive Skilling crowed to the magazine W e didnt want someone stuck in the past since the industry of yesterday is no longer Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways But Skillings fondness for the buttoneddown Fastow was not widely shared Many colleagues considered him a prickly even vindictive man prone to at tacking those he didnt like in Enrons group performance reviews Fastow through his attorney declined to comment for this story When he formed an d took a personal stake in the LJM partnerships that blew up in October th e conflict of interest inherent in those deals only added to his colleagues distaste for him Enron admits Fastow earned more than million from t he partnerships The Enron CFO wasnt any more popular on Wall Street wher e investment bankers bristled at the finance groups were smarter than y ou guys attitude Indeed that came back to haunt Enron when it needed ca pital commitments to stem the liquidity crisis Its the sort of organiza tion about which people said Screw them We dont really owe them anythin g says one investment banker While LJMand Fastows direct personal involvement and enrichmentshocked many the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Sk illing and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mids to fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the balance sheet Keeping the debt off Enrons books depended on a steady or r ising stock price and an investment grade credit rating They were put t ogether with good intentions to offset some risk says SP analyst Ron M Barone Its conceivable that it got away from them Did it ever The offbalancesheet structures grew increasingly complex and risky according to insiders and others who have studied the deals Some with names like Osprey Whitewing and Marlin were revealed in Enrons fin ancial filings and even rated by the big creditrating agencies But almost no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enrons total debt what triggers might hasten repayment or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder equity No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come due if this company got downgraded says one lender involved with Enron Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essenti ally dump the debts back on Enron In some cases if Enrons stock fell bel ow a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment gradeon ce unimaginablenearly billion in partnership debt would have to be cov ered by Enron At the same time the value of the assets in many of these p artnerships was dropping making it even harder for Enron to cover the debt HIGH HOPES Skilling tried to accelerate the sale of international assets after becoming chief operating officer in but the efforts were arduo us and timeconsuming Even as tech stocks melted down Skilling was determ ined not to scale back his grandiose broadband trading dreams or the result ing pricetoearnings multiple of almost that they helped create for Enr ons stock At its peak in August about a third of the stocks p rice was attributable to expectations for growth of broadband trading exec utives estimate That rapidly rising stock priceup in and in gave Skilli ng and Fastow a hot currency for luring investors into their offbalancesh eet deals They quickly became dependent on such deals to finance their exp ansion efforts It was like crack says a company insider Trouble is Enrons stock came tumbling back to earth when market valuations fell this year By April its price had fallen to about And its farflung operati onal troubles were taking their own toll In its muchhyped broadband busin ess for instance a capacity glut and financial meltdown made it hard to f ind creditworthy counterparties for trading And after spending some b illion to build and operate a fiberoptic network Enron found itself with an asset whose value was rapidly deteriorating Even last year company exe cutives could see the need to cut back an operation that had employee s and a cash burn rate of million a year SOMETHING TO PROVE And the international problems werent going away Enrons stake in the billion Dabhol power plant in India was mired in a dispute with its largest customer which refused to pay for electricity Some Indian politicians ha ve despised the deal for years claiming that cunning and even corrupt Enro n executives cut a deal that charged India too much for its power Enrons illfated investment in the waterservices business was anothe r drag on earnings Many saw the purchase of Wessex Water in England as a consolation prize for Rebecca P Mark the hardcharging Enron executive who had negotiated the Dabhol deal and other investments around the world With Skilling having won out as Lays clear heir apparent top executives wanted to move her out of the way say former insiders A narrowly split bo ard approved the Wessex deal which formed the core of Azurix Corp to be run by Mark But Enron was blindsided by British regulators who slashed the rates the utility could charge Meanwhile Mark piled on more highpriced water assets Once Skilling put her there he let her go wild says a former executive And shes going to go wild because she has something t o prove Mark spent too much on a water concession in Brazil and ran into political obstacles She declined to comment for this story But if Azurix was a prime example of Enrons sketchy investment strategy i t also demonstrated how the company tried to disguise its problems with fin ancial alchemy To set up the company Enron formed a partnership called th e Atlantic Water Trust in which it held a stake That kept Wessex off Enrons balance sheet Enrons partner in the joint venture was Marlin Wate r Trust which consisted of institutional investors To help attract them Enron promised to back up the debt with its own stock if necessary But if Enrons credit rating fell below investment grade and the stock fell below a certain point Enron could be on the hook for the partnerships mill ion in debt The end for Enron came when its murky finances and lessthanforthright dis closures spooked investors and Dynegy The clincher came when Dynegys bank ers spent hours sifting through a supposedly final draft of Enrons aboutt obereleased Qonly to discover two pages of damning new numbers when t he quarterly statement was made publicly available Debt coming due in the fourth quarter had leapt from under billion to billion Even worse cash on handto which Dynegy had recently contributed billionshrun k from billion to billion Dynegy had a twohour meeting with the new treasurer of Enron who had been in that seat for two weeks said a source close to the deal He had no clue where the numbers came from R ESPECT FOR ASSETS Skilling and Fastow face most of the wrath of reeling em ployees Someone told me yesterday if they see Jeff Skilling on the stree t they would scratch out his eyes says a former executive One of Fasto ws lawyers David B Gerger says his client has been the subject of death threats and antiSemitic tirades in Internet chat rooms Naturally peopl e look for scapegoats but it would be wrong to scapegoat Mr Fastow say s Gerger He confirms that Fastow has hired a big gun to handle his civil litigation David Boiess firm which represented the Justice Dept in its suit agains t Microsoft Corp On Dec Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes Lerach filed a s uit against Fastow Skilling and other Enron executives saying they il legally made more than billion off stock sales before Enron tanked And a source at the Securities Exchange Commission says four US Attorney Of fices are considering whether to pursue criminal charges against Enron and its officers Would the cash squeeze have caught up to Enron even without Skillings and Fastows fancy financing Credit analysts still argue that the debt would have been manageable absent the crisis of confidence that dried up Enrons trading business and access to the capital markets But even they have a n ew respect for oldfashioned highquality assets When things get really tough hard assets are the kind you can depend upon says SPs Shipman Thats something Enrons whizkid financiers failed to appreciate Enrons Stock Price DEC AUG DEC Data

NOW YOU DONT Editorials ENRON LET US COUNT THE CULPRITS BusinessWeek Copyright McGrawHill Inc Enron Corps bankruptcy is a disaster of epic proportions by any measure the height from which it fell the speed with which it has unraveled and t he pain it has inflicted on investors employees and creditors Virtually all the checks and balances designed to prevent this kind of financial melt down failed Unless remedied this could undermine public trust the capita l markets and the nations entire equity culture Even now no one really knows what liabilities are buried inside dozens of partnerships or the role exCEO Jeffrey Skilling played in creating a byzantine system of offbalan cesheet operations A culture of secrecy and a remarkable lack of transpar ency prevented any realistic assessment of the companys financial risk No thing less than an overhaul of the auditing profession is now required to p olice accounting standards Wall Street mutual funds and the business pre ss would also do well to rethink why each in its own way celebrated what is now revealed to be an arrogant duplicitous company managed in a dangero us manner page What is increasingly clear is that Skilling a former McKinsey Co consul tant and Harvard Business School grad tried to craft Enron as a new kind o f virtual trading giant operating outside the scrutiny of investors and re gulators Enrons numerous partnerships were shrouded in secrecy tucked aw ay off the balance sheet They were used to shift debt and assets off the b ooks while inflating earnings The chief financial officer ran and partly o wned two partnerships a clear conflict of interest Enron leveraged itself without a reality check by any outsider ASLEEP Hardly anyone inside the company was urging caution certainly not chairman Ken Lay The independent auditing committee on the board of directors was clearly asleep Given Enr ons arcane financial engineering the committee probably relied on Arthur Andersen the auditor for information But Andersen didnt blow any whistl es No surprise there It made more money selling consulting services to En ron last year than it did auditing the company Criticizing Enrons books m ight have jeopardized consulting work Similar conflicts of interest stoppe d Wall Street analysts from pulling the plug on Enron Even as Enron slid t oward bankruptcy buy recommendations were being issued by analysts who se firms were doing investmentbanking business with the company or were h oping to Did anyone really know what was going on inside Enron The rating agencies Moodys Investor Service and Standard Poors presumably had better acce ss than average investors but neither downgraded Enrons credit rating to below investment grade until the bitter end The rating agencies argue that had they downgraded Enron sooner they would have simply pushed the compan y into bankruptcy earlier Heres a flash So what Moodys and SP have on e basic jobassessing risk for investors If they couldnt penetrate Enron s complex financial engineering the rating agencies should have said so The business press including BusinessWeek did no better It celebrated Sk illings vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anythin g and trade it anywhere The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome o f a new postderegulation corporate model when it should have been much mo re aggressive in probing the companys opaque partnerships off balance she et maneuvers and soaring leverage TRAGIC Enrons fall is made all the mo re tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees Not only are many losing their jobs but some are also losing most of th eir retirement savings In perhaps its most egregious riskmanagement error employees mostly held Enron stock in their ks yet the company preve nted them from selling until they reached the age of People could only watch as the stock plummeted from to a dollar Diversification particu larly in retirement accounts is the cardinal rule in managing risk Enron broke that rule as have other companies Enrons tale is a clarifying event It reveals key weaknesses in the financ ial system that must be corrected as the US moves forward in the st cen tury If America is to have an equity culture in which individuals invest i n stocks and provide the capital for fast economic growth the market must be able to correctly value companies This requires making financial data r eadily available and easily comprehensible To restore public confidence several steps should be taken After accounti ng disasters at MicroStrategy Cendant Lucent Cisco and Waste Management it is clear that selfregulation is not working Conflicts of interest wi thin auditing firms remain widespread Investors can ignore analysts on TV who work for investment firms But someone has to play the role of the hone st watchdog Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act they wi ll wind up with a federally chartered oversight body It is equally clear t hat current standard accounting rules arent sufficient Loopholes allowed Enron to fool everyone making a mockery of public disclosure Regulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice in their ks Some of assets held in million k plans are in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan This lack of diversificati on puts too many people at risk In the end the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that fai led in its primary business mission to manage risk Had the Federal Reserv e and other central banks not flooded the global economy with liquidity in recent

Gesalman i n Houston sloan is NEWSWEEKs Wall Street editor His email address is sl Newsweek Copyright C Newsweek Inc All Rights Reserved Enron corp used to talk about becoming the worlds biggest company Instea d it became the worlds biggest corporate failure filing for bankruptcy l ast week The company which used complexity to its advantage on the way up became a victim of its own complex dealmaking on the way down A NEWSWEEK examination of Enrons filings shows that the companys fatal mistake was an unintended byproduct of one such deal The transaction first inflated En rons reportednet worth then deflated it When the company cleaned up its books this fall it triggered the billion networth writedown that to uched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy Enron looked like a welloiled machine but a lot of it seems to have been juryrigged The company was housed in a spiffy story building in downto wn Houston a structure whose elevators flashed Enrons latest stock price and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got to their offices In the best New Economy tradition Enron had an onsite h ealth club casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing in Enron stock But when things started going bad Enron couldnt cope It couldnt even fi re people properly Informationtechnology specialist Diana Peters says her entire department was told to clear out on half an hours notice and to ca ll their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next da y Very classy I was crying a lot of people were crying says Peters It reminded me of a mass funeral The company even had trouble going broke Normally a company hoards cash i n preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers and slowing down payments to vendors Enron didnt start doing that until a few days before the filing far too late Enron almost became the Flying Dutchman of the bankruptcy world It wanted to file in Wilmington Dela b ut the bankruptcy court there didnt want the case So Enron ended up in Ne w York City And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to li ne up billion of socalled debtorinpossession financing to keep the place operating Normally you make DIP arrangements before you file It would be lots of fun to give you Washingtons take on all this Enron be ing famous for close ties to the White House and the Republican Party But well leave that for another day because the juicy stuff probably wont sh ow up until the Democrats get in gear Hearings in the Republicancontrolle d House are set for this week and will focus on accounting and stock analy sts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enrons polit ical relationships and what if anything the White House did during Enron s final days Although some details are still murky one thing is clear Arthur Andersen Enrons outside accountant is in big trouble and it or its insurers wi ll have to fork over big bucks Andersens big problem stems from a company called JEDIas in Star Warsthat Enron now says should have been on it s books since Andersen allowed JEDI to remain off the books for years The other deal involving a company called Raptor caused the networth d isappearance that set Enron on the road to ruin JEDI stands for Joint Energy Development Investments It was a partnership between Enron and the California stateemployees pension fund known as Ca lpers The Force was with Enron which invested the money million ea ch from itself and Calpersin power plants energy stocks and such making more than percent a year Pretty neat In late Calpers was willin g to invest million in a new partnership JEDI But it wanted to fir st cash in its JEDI chips worth million Instead of just liquidatin g JEDI Enron got cute Im not sure why Enron declined to comment It w ent looking for an outsider to fork over million and take Calperss pl ace Enter something called Chewco Investmentsas in Chewbacca of Star Wa rs fame Chewco was a partnership of Enron employees and some undisclosed outsiders Who they are and how much they made is a mystery because Chewc o is a private entity Chewcos investors didnt have a spare million So Enron lent Chewco million and guaranteed a million loan that Chewco took out elsewhere Enron was thus at risk for its own JEDI stake a nd essentially all of Chewcos That being the case its a mystery why And ersen let Enron keep JEDI off its books Accounting experts who have looked at this transaction which Enron disclosed last month just shake their he ads Andersen has refused to comment saying its too early to reach conclu sions Enron has restated its earnings dating back to because it says JEDI should have been on its books since then Guess what The restated pro fits are far lower than the original ones Now to the deals that sank Enron As in JEDI Enron wont comment These t ransactions involve four companies called Raptor It looks like the Raptors were set up to let Enron use financial gymnastics to get gains from stocks it owned without actually selling them The major holdings were Rhythms Ne t Connections a now bankrupt startup telecom company and NewPower Holdin gs which competes with established power companies for customers At their height Enrons stake in these companies totaled about billion Friday s value about million Enron wont say why it didnt just sell the sto ck and take its profits The most logical explanation is tax avoidance Now the key to Enrons undoing The company committed to put billion of Enron stock into the Raptors to make them more creditworthy It didnt p romise a fixed number of sharesit promised billion worth regardless of the share price A seriously dumb move for a company that talks about h edging risks In return for that commitment the Raptors gave Enron bi llion of promissory notes Enron put them on its balance sheet as an asset When a company adds to its assets and nothing else changes its net worth rises Hence Enron marked up its net worth by billion But as the stock prices of Rhythms NewPower and Enron all sank Enron face d having to fork over a ruinous number of new shares So Enron paid mil lion to the Raptors outside investorsyet another mysterious partnership and liquidated the Raptors That eliminated the notes which eliminated th e aforementioned billion from Enrons net worth That set off the now famous October run on Enrons credit which ultimately led to bankruptcy N ow far too late Enron says it shouldnt have counted the notes as assets The bottom line numbers matter So does truth Enron was too clever by hal f And thats a good way to end up looking stupid Photo Enron built a pipeline to the GOP as well as to naturalgas

scare and sent the burgeoning scandal in new directions Arthur Andersen the esteemed accounting firm admitted it had destroyed Enron documents Thats bad but what Arthur Andersen says it doesnt know may be worse It says the records included a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence The firm goes on to say After receiving an SEC subpoena the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents What one wonders was Andersens instruction before it received the subpoenato destroy Enron documents with abandon Did the accountants comply with the directive to preserve the documents Andersen doesnt know At this time we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated the firm says in a statement Andersen says it has also asked former US Sen John Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersens records management policy and to recommend improvements It does not say how much it is paying Danforth for his counsel but it can have this policy tip for nothing Dont destroy documents related to a scandal that led to a bankruptcy that wiped out billion in shareholder value These unanswered questions are part of a pattern with Enron No one really knows how it got so rich or what it was doing with the many private partnerships managed by its executives No one knows what prompted former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling to quit the company in August Indeed at a bankruptcy court hearing earlier this week it was revealed that Enron does not know the location of of its top executives or even if they still work for the company Separately the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman called Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the companys looming bankruptcy This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions hes received from company executives Ari Fleischer the White House press secretary said Lay telephoned ONeill amid Enrons collapse to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations Lay added that Enron was heading to bankruptcy Fleischer said ONeill received calls from Lay on Oct and Nov said Treasury Spokeswoman Michele Davis By then Enron made its stunning disclosure of a million thirdquarter loss Still as of Oct Enron was still trading at over per share In a separate phone call to Don Evans Lay similarly worried about the default on its bank and bond debt He was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector Fleischer said Fleischer did not say what Evans or ONeill told Lay but they spoke to each other and they both agreed no action should be taken to intervene with their bond holders and indeed no action was taken The spokesman had said earlier he did not know of anyone in the White House who discussed Enrons financial situation Did he even askor was not knowing the better option Ashcroft stepped aside from the criminal investigation of Enron because he received campaign contributions from Enron executives during his campaign for the US Senate in In addition to contributing to Ashcrofts senatorial campaign Lay also gave to a leadership committee headed by thensenator Ashcroft according to the Center for Public Integrity Enron Lay and other executives have also been major contributors to President George Bush both during his presidential campaign and during his runs for the Texas statehouse Prior to Lays contacts with ONeill and Evans Enron officials had extensive contact with Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides when they worked together on a response to a much ballyhooed but quickly deflated energy crisis nocrisishtml in the spring of Trying to insulate himself from the scandal President Bush has ordered a review headed by ONeill of US pension and corporate disclosure rules That review is intended the administration says to avoid a repeat of the energytrading firms collapse in which thousands of employees lost most or all of their life savings But Fleischer dismissed suggestions that the Justice Department investigation announced earlier this week should give way to a probe by an independent counsel The president for his part saw Lay at a Houston charity event last spring at the White House with other business leaders last year But he said he never discussed Enrons finances I have never discussed with Mr Lay the financial problems of the company Bush said yesterday I have not met with him personally Thats good The last thing you want to do in a horror movie is meet with the villain alone USA

giant Enron Corp not only lavished campaign donations on President George W Bush but was one of Americas biggest political contributors spreading money across both parties on Capitol Hill Nearly half the current US House of Representatives and almost threequarters of the current Senate have been beneficiaries of Enron largesse in recent years say the Washington watchdog groups that monitor campaign cash Since Enron has made a whopping million in campaign donations percent to Republicans and percent to Democrats says the Center for Responsive Politics an organization that tracks political giving Nearly half of these funds were donated during when Enron was one of the top organizational donors in the United States the Center says The money kept coming in until just before Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec Since then as the controversy around Enron has grown some donations have been given back Texans were by far the biggest Enron recipients and Republicans got more than Democrats Bush being both a Texan and a Republican and a friend of Enron chairman Kenneth Lay to boot did very well Enron was Bushs biggest political patron as he headed into the presidential election In all it has made in contributions to his campaigns since when he was raising money for his first Texas gubernatorial race according to the Center for Public Integrity another followthemoney group MONEY FOR ACCESS But the giving did not stop after election day Enron officials contributed to his Florida recount committee and when the recount was ended they donated for the inaugural celebrations said Holley Bailey researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics I think what is interesting about their giving over the last year is that they used any method possible to support President Bushs campaign run she said What Enron got in exchange for the money was access Bailey asserted She noted that Lay had met Vice President Dick Cheney during last years California energy crisis at the same time the administration was formulating its energy policy One thing is clear They have written checks to a lot of people in this town and I guess that gets their phone calls answered when they call Cabinet secretaries Bailey said It was disclosed this week that Lay telephoned two Cabinet officials last fall as the companys financial situation worsened Enron on Dec made the largest bankruptcy court filing in US history The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into Enrons collapse which wiped out the pensions of thousands and several congressional committees are also investigating MIDAS TOUCH The White House points out accurately that Enron also contributed money to lawmakers Democrats among them Indeed on Capitol Hill few have escaped Enrons Midas touch Texas Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm both Republicans top the list having received and respectively in campaign contributions from Enron the Center for Responsive Politics says But senior Democrats and those on committees relevant to Enrons energytrading business got donations too For example Sen Charles Schumer of New York a Democrat received the Center said He is on the energy committee Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota received in Enron contributions Democratic Sen Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut who chairs the governmental affairs committee that will probe Enrons fall got a donation In the House the top beneficiary of Enron generosity Democrat Ken Bentsen of Texas has received in contributions since he was elected in But Bentsen is giving back of Enron money he has received since the last election not to Enron though He is looking for a fund that will help its laidoff employees Hes not the only one shunning Enron money now The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee as well as the Republican Governors Association recently returned Enron donations totaling And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is giving to charity a Enron donation that it received in late November just days before Enron filed for bankruptcy Asked why he topped the House list of Enron recipients Bentsen explained that his district is in the greater Houston area where Enron is based and that he has had to raise a lot of money over his career fighting wellfinanced challengers The bottom line is somedays Ive enjoyed support from Enron and other days I havent Bentsen added He recalls Lay supported his opponent Dolly Madison McKenna in He Lay said I think shes going to be better than you It really made me mad Bentsen said Senator Says Panel to Subpoena Enron And Arthur Andersen Among Others By Jocelyn Parker Dow Jones Business News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Dow Jones Newswires DETROIT US Sen Carl Levin said Friday a congressional panel will issue subpoenas to embattled energytrading giant Enron Corp its auditor Arthur Anderson and others following Andersons disclosure it destroyed documents related to its work for Enron At a press briefing in Detroit Mr Levin D Mich said the Anderson subpoena will require that the firm submit all information including emails and other documents The return date on the subpoena is Jan It is troubling that when theres an investigation going on that they Arthur Anderson would destroy the documents of their clients Mr Levin told reporters Mr Levin said he learned about the destruction of documents Thursday Enron ENE hasnt responded to the subpoenas Enron Houston went from a being a darling of Wall Street to making the largest bankruptcy filing in the nations history in December The Justice Department is investigating the company because of questions about the companys accounting practices and possible criminal wrongdoing The criminal investigation by the Department of Justice is not surprising in light of what is known so far Mr Levin said in a statement Mr Levin also said at the briefing that its likely that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will learn about other things that will no doubt lead to other subpoenas By Jocelyn Parker Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Federal Judge Declines To Transfer Enron Case To Houston By Kathy Chu Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow Jones A federal bankruptcy judge declined to transfer beleaguered Enron Corps ENE bankruptcy case to Houston as some creditors have requested giving the company its second taste of victory Friday The move by Judge Arthur J Gonzalez of the US Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York was widely expected by many bankruptcy experts and is an attempt to maintain stability for a case thats almost six weeks old Earlier Friday Enron said that Swiss bank UBS AG has agreed to buy part of the bankrupt companys energytrading operations This deal is considered vital to reviving a stagnant business that generated of the companys billion in revenue last year In his page ruling issued late Friday Judge Gonzalez said New York is the most efficient forum for administering Enrons bankruptcy case New York is a world financial center and as such has the resources that will be required to address the debtors financial issues he said Also because the parties most essential to reorganization are here it makes sense for the court to retain jurisdiction according to Gonzalez The companys debtorinpossession lenders its financial advisers and the majority of its lawyers are based in Manhattan Also of the companys largest unsecured claims belonging to a handful of financial institutions emanate from New York The judge said that while he is sympathetic to the concerns of Enrons former employees who have said it would be a burden for them to attend hearings outside of Texas many of the issues concerning these workers will be addressed by congressional and federal investigations Employees lost billions of dollars in savings when Enrons energytrading operations collapsed after the companys debt was downgraded to junk In the weeks leading up to the rating agencies decisions Enron restated more than three years of earnings and wrote down billion in shareholder equity The companys k plan holders along with creditors such as former merger partner Dynegy Inc DYN El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Dunhill Resources have all sought the cases transfer to Texas When informed late Friday by Dow Jones Newswires of the judges decision to keep the case in New York Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Obviously we are supportive of the decision Ashcroft spoke to business group after Enrons Lay made request Justice Department says By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved WASHINGTON AP Shortly after he was confirmed as attorney general John Ashcroft was invited by Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to speak at an exclusive meeting of corporate leaders Justice Department officials said Friday Lay who was vice chairman of the Business Council introduced Ashcroft at the Feb meeting in Washington Ashcroft spoke about the importance of lowering crime Government officials including Federal Reserve members as well as Cabinet secretaries from all recent administrations have spoken at other meetings of the Business Council whose members are executives of the nations largest companies Ashcrofts speech was arranged by his schedulers and the attorney general never spoke directly to Lay said department officials The information was released in response to an inquiry by The Associated Press about Ashcrofts dealings with Enron since he became attorney general Lay and Enron executives donated over to Ashcrofts fundraising committees in his unsuccessful campaign for Senate reelection in Ashcroft has recused himself from a Justice Department criminal investigation of the failed energy company Lays contacts with members of the Bush administration were the focus of intense scrutiny after officials disclosed that Lay and Enrons president had contacted two Cabinet members and a top Treasury official for help when the company was in a financial tailspin Enron asked Treasury official to call the banks to help avoid bankruptcy By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved WASHINGTON AP Enron sought the Bush administrations intervention with banks in an effort late last year to stop the companys spiral into bankruptcy the US Treasury Department disclosed Friday as the White House worked to control political fallout from a widening investigation This dog wont hunt Thats a reference to the politics of it said presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer amid the latest information on the collapse of the Houstonbased energy conglomerate Enron President Lawrence Greg Whalley telephoned Treasurys undersecretary for domestic finance Peter Fisher six to eight times in late October and early November said department spokeswoman Michele Davis It was the first indication that the energy trading firm which has ties to many top Bush administration officials had asked for government intervention as it faced collapse Once the seventh largest US company Enron delcared bankruptcy Dec As Enrons negotiations with its bankers for an extension of credit neared a decision point the president of Enron asked Undersecretary Fisher to call the banks Davis said Fisher inferred he was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit He made no such calls she said The announcement followed disclosures that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay one of President George W Bushs biggest political contributors had called Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the days leading up to the biggest bankruptcy filing in US history last fall Administration officials have denied that any government aid was ever extended to the beleaguered company Democrats seeing the disclosures as an opportunity to chip away at Bushs high approval ratings are emphasizing the close ties between Enron and administration officials and the impact of the failure on Enron employees Thousands of workers were laid off and many saw their retirement nest eggs vanish when Enron stock plunged in advance of the bankruptcy filing White House officials worked Friday to try to limit the damage and to put distance between the president and the Enron chief This needs to be fully investigated to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing by Enron said Bush press secretary Fleischer He said the president also is pressing for a review of rules governing k retirement plans like those at Enron If anybody else wants to focus on politics thats their prerogative But the presidents focus is on getting to the bottom of this fully Fleischer said aboard Air Force One on a presidential trip to Pennsylvania Meanwhile senior Bush adviser Karl Rove offered his view of the relationship between Bush and Lay The president knows him He is a friend But the idea that he is a friend in the sense that this is a guy whos a close intimate is just ludicrous Rove said in an interview with The Associated Press When Bush was the governor of Texas Lay was chairman of the governors business council They had quarterly meetings and hed come in and talk to the thengovernor about what it was they hoped to achieve at the meeting and theyd go over the agenda Rove said Bush has described Lay as a supporter He said he saw Lay twice last year but that they did not discuss

lack of holdings in th paragraphs Washington Jan Bloomberg Congress demanded documents and personal files from executives at Enron Corp auditor Arthur Andersen LLP and current and former officers and directors in an effort to find out what led to the biggest US bankruptcy The House Energy and Commerce Committee asked for the personal files of David Duncan and five other Andersen partners involved in the audit of Enron after Andersen said its employees had destroyed documents and emails committee spokesman Ken Johnson said The Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations subpoenaed papers from both Enron once the biggest energy trader and Andersen Congress acted a day after President George W Bushs administration said Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay a longtime political backer of the president had unsuccessfully sought government help for Enron from Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill Today Treasury disclosed that Enron President Greg Whalley called Undersecretary Peter Fisher at least six times in October and early November to ask him to contact bankers on behalf of the company This debacle is so massive it requires speed and thoroughness said Senator Carl Levin the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations The subpoenas are necessary in order to get prompt and thorough review of the documents in question Levin said the subpoenas were changed at the last minute yesterday to request information on Andersens destruction of documents a development he said was very troubling Responses to the subpoenas are due

value Employees who were unable to sell Enron stock in their retirement plans say they lost about million At least six congressional committees are investigating Enrons collapse Committee leaders say they need to understand exactly what happened at Enron to determine whether new laws and regulations are needed to improve disclosure change accounting practices or protect employee retirement accounts Contacts Disclosed After declining to comment in detail on Enrons bankruptcy for several weeks yesterday the administration said Lay called Evans on Oct and asked him to intervene with Moodys Investors Service to prevent a downgrade of Enrons debt Commerce spokesman Jim Dyke said Evans decided that taking any action would be inappropriate Dyke said There was no information exchanged between Mr Lay and Secretary Evans that was not part of the public domain Lay also spoke with ONeill about how a collapse of Enron might hurt financial markets Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Davis said yesterday ONeill also decided to take no action When Whalley called Fisher Undersecretary Fisher inferred he was being asked to encourage banks to extend credit Davis said He made no such calls Treasury said that while a trust in his parents name included Enron shares Fisher does not now and never has held common stock in Enron Evans and ONeill didnt tell Bush about the calls until yesterday White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush said he hasnt spoken to Lay in more than six months Campaign Contributions Lay raised more than for Bushs presidential campaign and let Bush aides use Enrons corporate jet on at least occasions Enron and its employees together were Bushs th largest backer for the election giving Enron and its employees gave Democrat Al Gore Representative Henry Waxman of California the senior Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee today sent letters to ONeill and Evans requesting details on all contacts between Enron and officials at Treasury and Commerce He also wants to know what the two departments told the White House The purpose of this request is to determine why the administration apparently did nothing to mitigate the harm of the Enron bankruptcy to thousands of its employees and shareholders Waxman wrote Senate Subpoenas The documents sought by the Senate include working papers and notes from the auditors memorandums from executives putting into place internal controls and memos outlining and describing financing vehicles used for offbalancesheet financing and other transactions Lay who got million from the sale of his

specialpurpose entities and limited partnerships that Enron used Levin said It is asking whether the financing techniques Enron used should have raised flags for Enrons board and Andersen SEC Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said yesterday the SEC will add Andersens document destruction to the Enronrelated matters it is investigating Destruction of documents is obviously an extremely serious matter Cutler said Lawyers representing investors in lawsuits against Enron are watching the subcommittee because it is likely to obtain information sooner than will the civil courts Most of the shareholder lawsuits were filed in federal court in Houston and wont move to the discovery phase in which lawyers may interrogate defendants and demand documents for six months Skilling was clearly moving the company from an assetbased model to a pure trading machine said Patrick Daniels a lawyer at Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes Lerach You would hope someone inside Enron was doing some

or make a deal with lowlevel employees said Gregory Wallance a former federal prosecutor US Attorney General John Ashcroft wont be involved in the investigation having announced yesterday his recusal from Enron matters The Houstonbased company was a major contributor to his Senate campaign Next in line is Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson who is expected to have little involvement in the investigation legal experts say Task Force The Justice Department is establishing an Enron task force to be headed by Leslie Caldwell the chief of the criminal division for the US attorneys office in San Francisco Caldwell who has prosecuted organized crime and while collar crime will report to Hochberg Enron announced Nov that it had inflated earnings by million over four years On Dec it filed the biggest US bankruptcy after a sevenweek stock slide that erased billion in market value wiped out jobs and cost employees about million in retirement savings During that period employees were unable to sell Enron stock in their k plans Top executives who had large holdings outside of the retirement plan were able to sell The investigation will likely concentrate on whether executives purposely misled investors about Enrons financial condition to prove criminal wrongdoing experts say Deliberate misrepresentation of a companys financial condition transforms what is usually a civil violation of federal disclosure rules into a crime punishable by as much as years in prison and a million fine Best and Brightest The investigation will be based in Washington and include lawyers from the criminal division including the fraud section and from US attorneys offices throughout the country Lawyers from the New York and San Francisco offices which specialize in securities law and white collar crime are expected to be involved a Justice Department official said Were bringing in our best and brightest said Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra You go where they are known for this type of investigations The decision to centralize the investigation makes sense because theres an enormous amount of legwork that goes into a case like this said Wallance Its inefficient to duplicate

interviews experts say They will be looking at what was being said to whom it was being said and why it was being said said Joe Whitley a former acting associate attorney general Document destruction by Arthur Andersen LLP Enrons auditor will also be examined to determine if the firm can be charged with obstruction of justice Whitley said Recusals Recusals Ashcrofts announcement that he wouldnt participate in the Enron probe followed a call to step aside by US Representative Henry Waxman a California Democrat who cited about that Enron and its Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay made to political groups aiding Ashcrofts unsuccessful reelection bid When Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation he was unaware of the letter sent to his office by Waxman a Justice Department official said The US attorneys office in Houston also recused itself from the investigation because of the fact that a number of attorneys in the office including the US attorney have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankruptcy according to a statement released by US Attorney Michael Shelby The Justice Department said it hasnt determined yet how it will conduct the investigation in Houston though it may use Federal Bureau of Investigation facilities there Men in Charge In addition to the Enron probe Chertoff is also running the investigation

lawsuit Enron brought against Dynegy for backing out of a merger that was supposed to rescue Enron Enrons Chapter case and the lawsuit were filed Dec in Manhattan where a small unit Enron Metals and Commodity Corp is based Dynegy argued in court papers that both cases should be shifted to Houston in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties Enron once a dominant force in the energy trading business collapsed after announcing on Nov that it inflated earnings by million over four years The disclosure triggered a loss of confidence among investors and customers and the cancellation of a planned billion merger with Dynegy The effort to move the case to Houston divided Enrons creditors Some banks including several based in New York and led by JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc opposed a transfer A committee appointed to represent Enrons unsecured creditors also favored keeping the case in New York Some Houstonbased creditors of Enron such as El Paso Group Inc

LLP Chief Executive Joseph Berardino gave inaccurate testimony to Congress last month about its audit of an Enron Corp partnership because he didnt know the facts until this week an Andersen spokesman said Were still trying to understand why he didnt know about it Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said There are millions of Enron documents we have to deal with and were doing the best we can Berardino who has headed the fifth largest accounting firm for a year identified incorrectly who joined Enron in investing in an affiliated partnership of the company That partnership called Chewco Investments LP was kept off Enrons books enabling the energy trader to inflate earnings by million starting in Andersens accounting of Enron is under investigation by the Justice Department the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress Andersen said yesterday that some of its employees destroyed a substantial number of documents related to its Enron audit Berardino learned of the correct information earlier this week when a news reporter called with an inquiry and Andersen looked up the answer Tabolt said The mistake was inconsequential because it would have had no effect on how Andersen handled its Enron audits or on the substance of Berardinos testimony he said Berardino told the House Financial Services Committee on Dec that Andersen informed Enrons audit committee of possible illegal acts within the company involving Chewco Andersen wasnt aware during the audits of the extent of Enrons financial commitment to Chewco information that would have compelled the partnership to be included on Enrons books Berardino testified Small Companies Enrons partner in the investment was a large financial institution Berardino told Congress This institution which the Wall Street Journal identified as Barclays Plc a British banking group was to have its losses covered by Enron Berardino said Andersen wasnt aware of the extent of Enrons commitment he said The Chewco investor wasnt a large financial institution but two limitedliability companies called Big River and Little River Tabolt said These two small companies borrowed about million from the large bank he said A Barclays spokesman declined to comment Andersen discovered Berardinos error this week while researching the answer to a Wall Street Journal reporters question Tabolt said No Material Effect The mistake had no material effect on Mr Berardinos testimony Tabolt said Were still trying to understand why we werent made aware of the information at the time of the audits Spokesmen for House Financial Services Committee

responsibilities said Sarah Thobae a spokeswoman for Houston based Compaq the second largestpersonal computer maker A director since Lay resigned effective Dec she said Enron once the biggest energy trader said Nov that it had inflated earnings by million over four years The company filed Dec for bankruptcy protection after a sevenweek stock slide that erased billion in value Lay quit as a director of Eli Lilly and Co on Dec and left the board of directors of I Technologies in October It could be that he knows something thats going to happen that will be embarrassing for the companies regarding the bankruptcy said Jay Lorsch a Harvard Business School professor whos written about corporate governance He might want to avoid them that embarrassment Lorsch said he doesnt think Lay was forced from the boards because so much time passed between the resignations Yesterday President George W Bushs administration said Lay unsuccessfully sought help for Enron from two Cabinet secretaries

yesterday appointed a task force to investigate Enrons collapse and at least six congressional committees are investigating Congress today demanded documents and personal files from executives of

Franken Sheila MacVicar Jason Be llini CNN Special Report With Aaron Brown c Copyright eMediaMillWorks Inc fka Federal Document Clearing House Inc All Rights Reserved We said last night that the collapse of Enron had been largely underreporte d That has now changed as you will hear tonight and it is that story En ron that begins our whip around the world We start at the White House and our Senior White House Correspondent John King John a headline from you please JOHN KING SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Aaron because of Enrons poli tical connections the nations top prosecutor the Attorney General John A shcroft and his chief of staff today had to recuse themselves from the gro wing criminal investigation into the companys bankruptcy Why Because Joh n Ashcroft took a lot of money from Enron and its chief executives The administration also for the first time today acknowledged the Enron C EO called two cabinet members before the company filed for bankruptcy and a sked for help The administration insists it didnt help him and that it di d nothing wrong Aaron BROWN John a lot on Enron tonight Well be back with you shortly COMMERCIAL BREAK BROWN Enron exploded today Its been a while since the energy company th e trading company a Fortune giant went bankrupt costing investors inc luding the companys employees billions of dollars The story has simmered around for a while overwhelmed by the war waiting its time in the way a good story does and the time has finally come Last night we reported the Justice Department was opening a criminal investigat ion and today the case took a political turn as well a turn that could we ll be the first real threat to the Bush Administration Developments to report lots of them We go back to the White House and Sen ior White House Correspondent John King John good evening KING Good evening to you Aaron A complicated story anyway because of the facts even more so because of the politics If you brought together senio r officials in the Bush Administration and said everyone with ties to Enro n raise your hands a lot of hands would go up The President knows the CEO quite well Hes an old family friend So does the Vice President and his Chief of Staff The Presidents top political ad viser is close to Enron so is his top economic adviser Several members of the cabinet too The White House insists though there has been no questio nable behavior There are though a lot of questions BEGIN VIDEOTAPE KING voice over Attorney General John Ashcroft is recusing himself from the criminal investigation of Enron as is his Chief of Staff The reason in political contributions from Enron and its top executives in Cam paign when Ashcroft was running for reelection to the Senate Another reflection of the political stakes in the Oval Office the Presiden t himself announcing two new cabinet level reviews to determine if the gove rnment needs stronger disclosure laws to protect shareholders and investors in k and other retirement plans GEORGE W BUSH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES I have great concern for th e stories for those I read about in the stories who put their life savings aside and for whatever reason based upon some rule or regulation got tra pped in this awful bankruptcy and have lost life savings KING Energy giant Enron first gave a public hint of its financial troubl es last October and then filed for bankruptcy in early December a major e conomic story in any event and a major political story too because Enron an d its CEO Ken Lay have deep connections to the Bush family and in both po litical parties in Congress BUSH I have never discussed with Mr Lay the financial problems of the com pany KING But Lay did alert top Bush deputies that Enron was in trouble and as ked for help well before the December bankruptcy filing He called Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans in late October and ONeill a second time in early November Sources say Lay wanted help shoring up the companys bond rating Aides say Secretaries ONeill and Evans decided there was nothing the government cou ld or should do The White House says they did not pass the news on to the President or any other senior administration officials ARI FLEISCHER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY The President is pleased with t he actions that his cabinet secretaries took He thinks they acted wisely a nd properly Lay is an old Bush family friend and he and his company a major donor to b oth political parties In the campaign cycle alone Enron and its exec utives contributed more than million to federal candidates and politic al committees went to the Bush Campaign million to other Rep ublican campaigns and committees and to the Democrats Four Congressional committees are also investigating Enron and Democrats w ant more information on the companys contacts with the Bush White House END VIDEOTAPE KING on camera In hindsight and there is always hindsight it seems in s uch cases top Bush Administration officials say yes they wish word of tho se contacts between Ken Lay the Enron CEO and Bush cabinet secretaries ca me out sooner but they say in the end any investigation will show this t hat a top Bush fundraiser asked for help and was told no and that this Pre sident now is showing no hesitancy at all in investigating a man whos not only a top political supporter but a longtime family friend Aaron BROWN You could almost hear Democrats smacking their lips a little bit on this one Was the White House in the briefings today and around the buildi ng defensive about this or did they seem people seem comfortable that the yre OK KING Quite defensive about it Aaron Some phone calls after the White Hou se briefing by officials saying why so many questions about this This is an administration of unquestioned integrity Why do you want to know all th ese things But they also understand now many Democrats in the Congress saw the invest igations of the Clinton Administration subpoenas for documents in cases th at the Clintons thought were way out of bounds no questions should be aske d The Democrats will ask questions about this So will reporters The Bush Administration I think got the message today that they have to be quicker and more forthcoming in releasing any any details at all of consul tations or conversations with this company Again they say in the end the y will be proven that the President did nothing wrong and that in fact hi s two cabinet secretaries one Don Evans a very close friend of Ken Lay sa id no when this man asked for help BROWN And just one other quick thing the decision to have a White House are these White House investigations into Enron or White House discussio ns about disclosure laws dealing with investments and investors generally KING There are a number of investigations so it gets confusing The Justi ce Department even though the Attorney General and the US Attorney and m ost of his staff in Houston have recused themselves because of political r elationships or other relationships The Justice Department is having a cri minal investigation The Labor Department oversees pensions It has a separate investigation int o the pension programs Now there will be two cabinet level taskforces head ed by the Treasury Department that involve other departments including the Securities and Exchange Commission to see if the government did something wrong here if you will if there should be stronger rules that require an Enron when its finances are going south to tell its shareholders and esp ecially to tell its employees who have so much stock in those k plans All the Enron executives who knew about this sold their stock The employ ees lost their life savings The President wants to know if the government needs to make sure that doesnt happen again BROWN John the old wire service reported that you are you probably wan t to chase the fire thats going on somewhere in DC KING We get those out here BROWN Yes thank you for your work tonight Senior White House Corresponde nt John King We said that the Enron collapse is both a political story and a business story Its a complicated story to be sure Tonight were join ed by someone who can help us understand both the business and the politics of this Jim Glassman writes a weekly Washington Post investment column H es also a Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute He joins us tonight from New York Jim good evening JAMES GLASSMAN HOST TECHCENTRALSTATIONCOM Good evening Aaron BROWN How could so many I mean if you looked at all of the mutual funds and all the investment houses that recommended Enron the stock price shot way up It looked like a terrific company How could so many smart people have been so dumb GLASSMAN They didnt just recommend it they owned it I mean companies li ke Janus Fidelity There are a lot of analysts that have conflicts of inte rest but many of them who did not really praised this company to the sky Fortune named it six years in a row the most innovative company in Ameri ca Basically what was going on was that Enron was deceiving investors deceiv ing analysts overstating the profits it was making hiding some of the loa ns that it had taken out and as soon as this was found out the company ba sically got capital punishment which in my opinion it deserved And I thin k its a good lesson to other companies not to deceive investors Now the question of whether it did something illegal or not is another ma tter Just the fact that it was very clearly trying to say that it was in m uch better shape than it was Unfortunately a lot of little people got hur t BROWN I want to talk about that but are you telling me that a company can mislead investors mislead the public about how much money its actually m aking or how much debt it actually has and that is not in and of itself a crime GLASSMAN Well what Enron was doing specifically about the debt was it wa s reporting that it had billion in debt It really had about three time s that much and the other debt was pushed off onto other related entities and it was very very difficult for any analyst or the public to find out about it Now its very difficult to pass enough accounting rules to take care of ev ery shenanigan that a companys going to come up with What you need is a m arket and investors who will crack down really really hard on companies th at are being deceptive if not dishonest and thats whats happened in thi s case But yes its not hard to hide things Its not hard at all to hide things BROWN Thats comforting to know for those of us who have money in the mark et GLASSMAN But you know Aaron really the way to prevent yourself from gett ing burned is by being diversified Things are going to happen like Enron and there have been other cases There are not that many of them but there are other cases And if you have a huge chunk of your retirement savings i n one company this kind of thing can happen a company that looks good in all of its aspects and bang it turns out that its not on the level BROWN But thats exactly what happened to the employees that their k money GLASSMAN Yes Yes BROWN was going into the company and worse they were not allowed to se ll it GLASSMAN Yes and I think thats a much more serious problem and thats w hat some of the policymakers in Washington are looking into and I think th eres a lesson for your viewers You know most companies make it easy for you as an employee to buy corporate stock and the problem that you get in to is that if you lose your job not only have you lost your everyday livel ihood but you also may have lost a big chunk of your retirement savings if your company goes out of business as Enron did The lockin the fact that employees could not sell their stock for a certa in period was not good and the fact that apparently executives had access to information that employees did not was also not good BROWN Jim next time and I expect theres going to be one we need to tal k about the politics of this Thanks for joining us tonight GLASSMAN Love to do that Thank you Aaron BROWN Thank you sir GLASSMAN OK BROWN Jim Glassman in New York When we return gunfire at the

penchant for complex bet s on everything under the sun advertising space broadband paper the we ather and more than other products Widening probe of Texasbased Enron could dog Bush as Whitewater plagued Cl inton By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved WASHINGTON AP The expanding investigation into the collapse of Enron Co rp and the companys close ties to the Bush administration could quickly t urn into a consuming political liability for President George W Bush in sp ite of his currently high approval ratings And Democrats are pressing hard for just that At this point no one is alleging wrongdoing by Bush or top members of his administration in the bankruptcy of the Houstonbased energy trading compan y a failure that cost thousands of jobs and ravaged the retirement savings of many employees But such investigations tend to take on a life of their own And Democrats sensing a congressional electionyear opportunity are working hard to tur n up the heat Some Democrats are likening the probe to the Whitewater and campaign fundr aising investigations that plagued former President Bill Clinton The reason this is so potentially devastating to Bush is that it brings to life in very real terms the notion that when push comes to shove hes for the big business special interests and not for the little guy said forme r Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart The controversy deepened on Thursday with the disclosure by the White House that Enron Chairman Kenneth L Lay a longtime friend of the president ca lled two of Bushs Cabinet officers Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and C ommerce Secretary Don Evans before the company filed for bankruptcy late last year The disclosure came a day after the Justice Department announced it was ope ning a criminal investigation of the energy companys collapse including w hether it defrauded investors by deliberately concealing information about its finances Attorney General John Ashcroft who received campaign contributions from En ron executives during his failed senatorial bid stepped aside from th e investigation The collapse the largest corporate bankruptcy ever is also being probed b y the Labor Department and by the Securities and Exchange Commission which is looking into the companys destruction of possibly key financial docume nts and by five congressional committees Sen Joseph Lieberman leading one of those inquiries is promising a sear ch for the truth not a witch hunt But some Republicans including White House spokesman Ari Fleischer used just that term witch hunt on Thursday in describing the widening inves tigation Theres not even smoke here let alone a fire said Charles Black a vete ran Republican consultant They can keep it going in terms of probing Enron looking into what happen ed to those people who lost their pensions what happened to the accounting All those are legitimate issues said Black But theres no evidence th at any elected officials did anything for Enron Bush a former Texas oilman himself on Thursday told reporters I have ne ver discussed with Mr Lay the financial problems of the company And Flei scher said that no one in the administration offered to intervene on Enron s behalf This is hardly going to be a scandal that brings down President Bush but it will be a nagging problem for the Bush administration for some time to c ome said Larry Sabato a University of Virginia political scientist But Sabato said it has all the ingredients to become allconsuming because the Bush administration is so laden with corporate types and people with t ies to the energy industry Its understandable to the American people It s the big boys versus the little guys who got hurt These things can be an enormous distraction But by the end of the Clinton administration we learned that the best thing to do is assign a team to d isclose everything and to keep everyone else out of it said Paul Begala a former Clinton political adviser Lanny Davis who was special counsel to Clinton from to urged De mocrats to not take the same low road he claims Republicans took in pursuin g the Whitewater and related inquiries He said so far he sees nothing in the Enron case to link Bush administratio n officials to the collapse other than innuendo Lets go after the seriou s stuff including why Enron employees were prevented from unloading their Enron stock in their companymanaged retirement plans as the share prices plunged from over dlrs to under dlrs Davis said EDITORS NOTE Tom Raum

Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow Jones Energy companies increased concern about exposure t o their trading partners following the meltdown of former energy giant Enro n Corp ENE has renewed interest in the development of clearinghouses for the North American electricity markets Its long been thought that the continents power markets could benefit fro m a formal clearing function in which a central institution extends financ ial guarantees on trades Impediments that frustrated past efforts remain but Enrons rapid collapse and the tighter credit standards faced by the re st of the industry have given clearinghouse backers new ammunition The idea was already in peoples heads that it was something good to have said Jim Walker senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc a technology research firm in Cambridge Mass The Enron situation made people think we need to get it faster Enron formerly the largest wholesale trader of electricity and natural gas filed for bankruptcy protection Dec The former titans fall stunned t he industry and led to increased scrutiny of power companies credit by rat ings agencies and trading partners The US power markets which Forrester Research estimates traded bil lion worth of wholesale electricity in lack a central exchange Most power is traded over the counter with companies contacting each other dir ectly and left on the hook if their counterparty defaults A clearinghouse would protect against counterparty default and reduce the a mount of collateral companies must post to back their trades analysts said Under such a system the clearinghouse sets margin requirements and acts as counterparty to every trade It collects fees and in return steps in to cover defaults A number of energy companies including Sempra Energy SRE Williams Cos WMB Mirant Corp MIR and Consolidated Edison Inc ED said they welco me the idea We certainly support that idea and think it would be beneficial and would go a long way toward helping to manage the credit risk of the counterpartie s Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said Clearing For Takeoff Anticipating increased demand for insulation against trading risk several organizations plan to roll out clearing services for electricity markets th is year The New York Mercantile Exchange the worlds largest energy marketplace h opes to offer clearing services to power traders sometime in spokeswo man Nachamah Jacobovits said Nymex began extending clearing services to th e overthecounter markets for natural gas products in November We have accelerated because of the Enron problems Jacobovits said IntercontinentalExchange a fastgrowing Internetbased marketplace backed by a number of leading energy companies and banks is also exploring the po ssibility of expanding its clearing function to include electricity Senior Vice President David Goone said Theres tremendous demand to start coming up with a clearing solution for the electricity marketplace Goone said Clearing would allow more partic ipants to trade Because the exchange is still hammering out the details Goone wouldnt say which electricity products might be covered or when clearing services woul d be in place ICE which last year bought Londons International Petroleum Exchange the worlds secondlargest energy futures exchange has an agreement with the L ondon Clearing House to provide clearing services for natural gas and crude oil trades done on ICE beginning in the first quarter of A third company called EnergyClear based in Houston plans to launch a cle aringhouse for electricity and natural gas in the next three to six months according to Jimmy Wright senior vice president of business development Energy companies will own and govern the clearinghouse itself The Bank of New York BK and brokers Prebon Yamane and Amerex own a unit that will ope rate the clearinghouse EnergyClear has the technology and regulatory approval to clear trades but must get its membership and governing rules in place before it can begin o perating Wright said The effort was stalled as energy companies shifted t heir attention to sorting out their exposure to Enron Wright said We lost probably weeks or a month if not more of productive time he sa id The Hard Part Despite the support analysts said its difficult to estimate how much busi ness a clearinghouse could actually do Developing a clearing function for electricity will be more complicated than for other commodities because of the volatility of power prices and the Balkanized nature of the electricity markets with rules products and liquidity varying from region to region energy experts said Nymex tried and failed to create a market for electricity futures standar d products traded on a regulated exchange with clearing and settlement serv ices Electricity futures failed to catch on with energy companies as a ris kmanagement tool in part because there isnt a national benchmark to use as reference point As liquidity develops in highly traded benchmark products they will want to have a clearinghouse for those products Walker said Thus far companies have been reluctant to pay for clearing services in the electricity markets said Ken Nichols president of NexClear Inc NexClear spent two years trying to develop an electricitymarket clearinghouse but gave up last summer when it couldnt secure enough money to start up The willingness to pay has not been there Nichols said How many more e xamples does the industry need to realize the cost of mitigating credit ris k A standard set of rules governing the trading operations of each region mig ht be necessary before a clearinghouse could begin operating said Joseph O ates vice president for energy management at Consolidated Edison Co Federal energy regulators are pushing utilities and grid operators to devel op uniform regional markets with standard rules Its not clear how quickly these could be up and running But the independent powergrid managers aro und the country generally offer clearing and settlement services in the mar kets they operate and those could be expanded as the socalled independent system operators and regional transmission organizations grow It is these ISOs these RTOs that are right in the middle of these markets and probably need to take on the function of not just being the traffic co p in these markets but also the referee and auctioneer that makes these mar kets work Larry Makovich senior director for electric power research at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates said By Kristen McNamara Dow Jones Newswires kristen owjonescom Jon Kamp in Chicago contributed to this article WHITE HOUSE WATCH Enron Story Heats Up At White House Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Alex Keto A Dow Jones Newswires Analysis WASHINGTON Dow Jones The longsimmering story over the collapse of Enro n ENE and its political contributions to President George W Bush heated up considerably Thursday with the revelation that Enron Chairman Kenneth La y pleaded for help from the administration while his company was going down in flames Administration officials turned Lay down but the news brings the issues of political contributions and political favors into uncomfortably close prox imity For his part Bush said he was out of the loop I have never discussed with Mr Lay the financial problems of the company The last time that I saw Mr Lay was at my mothers fundraising event for literacy in Houston That would have been last spring Bush said Bush went on to say he wants to see a full investigation into Enrons bankr uptcy the largest in US history What anybodys going to find out is that this administration will fully in vestigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy to make sure we can learn fr om the past and make sure workers are protected Bush said Nevertheless the White House appeared to be buffeted by fastmoving events with White House spokesman Ari Fleischer denying at midday there was any c onflict of interest in having Attorney General John Ashcroft who received political contributions from Enron as a Senate candidate oversee a crimina l probe of the companys bankruptcy Less then two hours later Ashcroft an d a top aide recused themselves from the investigation Shortly after the Ashcroft announcement Arthur Andersen LLP the company t hat served as Enrons auditors announced that a significant number of th e companys documents and records had been destroyed Both federal and cong ressional investigators have been seeking the documents Fleischer said that during the autumn Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O Neill to warn him that Enron was on the verge of collapse and Lay said the bankruptcy of his company could be as destabilizing as the implosion of th e LongTerm Capital Management hedge fund in the late s However upon investigation the Treasury Department rejected Lays argumen ts Later Lay called Commerce Secretary Don Evans to say he Lay was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the en ergy sector Evans then called ONeill but they both agreed no action should be taken t o intervene with their bond holders Fleischer said Even before the latest revelations the White House had confirmed Vice Pres ident Dick Cheney or his aides met with Enron officials six times last year to discuss energy issues while the White House was drawing up its energy p lan However Fleischer said the fact that Lay and others were talking to top of ficials isnt in and of itself a crime I want to remind you that communication is not a wrongdoing What took pla ce here was they received phone calls and took no action The charge has b een did the government take any action And the answer from these two offi cials is no Fleischer said I think it should surprise no one that people in the administration receiv e phone calls from people who are either in business or at unions It happe ns everyday Fleischer said However some of Fleischers assertions were to be blunt surprising To begin with Fleischer said Thursday morning was the first time that ONe ill and Evans mentioned to Bush they had been in contact with Lay in the we eks just ahead of the companys bankruptcy In addition Fleischer said no one in the administration briefed Bush about Enrons woes and he was hard pressed to say how the president learned the company had gone belly up late last year He learned last fall And I couldnt tell you if he learned as a result of the media accounts when everybody wrote that Enron had gone bankrupt or th rough any other mechanism He learned last fall Bush said However this explanation appeared to be rather thin considering that Bush was fully informed and deeply involved in the financial bailout of the nati ons airlines at the same time in part because thousands of jobs were at ri sk Enron employed workers Asked if in hindsight the president wished he had been better informed of the developments at Enron and among his top officials Fleischer said No Adding to the White Houses discomfort is the fact that Democrats on Capito l Hill are gearing up for hearings on Enron Fleischer warned them against going too far Its appropriate to take a look into what led to the bankruptcy of Enron a nd whether or not anything was done wrong in the process of Enron going ban krupt But if thats a politically charged a politically motivated effort then I think the American people are going to say that this is just anothe r fishing expedition another endless investigation the type that they sou red on over the last many years Fleischer said Bush Warns Iran Not To Shelter Fleeing AlQaida Following reports that Iran may be sheltering small numbers of fleeing alQ aida or Taliban fighters and trying to control Afghanistans western provin ces Bush bluntly warned Tehran it will be held accountable for any moves t o terrorism or terrorists Any nation that thwarts our ability to rout terror out where it exists wil l be held to account one way or the other Bush said We had some positive signals early early in this war from from the Ira nians We would hope that they would continue to be a positive force in hel ping us bring people to justice We would hope for example they wouldnt allow alQaida murderers to hide

Rumsfeld said By Alex Keto Dow Jones Newswires Alex owjonescom POINT OF VIEW A New Champion For Disclosure Bush Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Neal Lipschutz A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones Corporate disclosure found a highprofile champion T hursday the president of the United States Its not often that the chief executive of the worlds most powerful nation concerns himself with issues such as what public companies should have to tell investors Thats what cabinet officers and federal agency heads are f or But President George W Bush was provoked Thursday to announce the creation of a highlevel working group to study disclosure rules to see if they nee d to be improved The reason for this comes down to one word Enron In light of the Chapter filing by former highflying Enron Corp Bush s aid Thursday that he was forming a working group consisting of representati ves of the Treasury the Federal Reserve the Securities and Exchange Commi ssion and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to review disclosure rul es Dow Jones Newswires reported Many of Enrons woes stemmed from lightly reported offbalancesheet transa ctions Now its unlikely that the SEC needs the help of all these other agencies to get the job done It embarked preEnron on a broad effort to improve and make current corporate disclosure of material developments This might be a case of too many cooks But it still has to be counted as a silver lining of the Enron mess that a better disclosure regime will now get the crisisinduced impetus often need ed to create real change Assuming this working group brings back a plan that really will make compan ies disclose more of their pertinent financials in a timely and understanda ble way Bush will have no choice but to back it After all he formed the working group And its in his political interest given his and the administrations relationship with Enrons leaders to b ack some regulatory lessons from the companys downfall and impose a more t ransparent regimen of accounting For its part the SEC under Chairman Harvey L Pitt should tell its colle agues at the other agencies joining the working group that it already has a plan The SEC then needs to flesh it out in an appropriate way and win the backing of the other agencies Enrons failure is an opportunity to overcome the businessasusual objecti ons that are bound to rise from a proposal that would significantly alter a nd improve the way companies report important developments to investors Notwithstanding the bureaucratic drag of a working group the support of a popular president for such a usually obscure effort has got to be a big plu s in getting something done Neal Lipschutz is

Jones Company Inc Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This report was originally published Thursday NEW YORK Dow Jones Enron Corp ENE Thursday confirmed its chairman an d chief executive Kenneth Lay contacted top Bush administration officials to warn that bankruptcy was a possibility for the Houston energy trader Earlier Thursday White House officials said Lay contacted Treasury Secreta ry Paul ONeill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans prior to the companys ban kruptcy filing in early December Lay made phone calls to tell senior government officials about the situati on at Enron an Enron spokesman said He told them that we were working t o avoid bankruptcy but it couldnt be ruled out He didnt ask for anythin g He was giving information According to the spokesman Lay thought the officials needed to know of the looming threat of bankruptcy because Enron was one of the nations leading companies and was heavily involved in national energy markets Lay wanted them to know so they could do anything they needed to the spo kesman said adding that he didnt know when the calls were made Enron and Lay have been leading contributors to the President George W Bus h as well as to a long list of Democratic and Republican candidates When asked if Lay had a personal connection to either Evans or ONeill the spokesman said he had no idea Prior to his appointment as Commerce Secretary Evans served as chief execu tive of Tom Brown Inc TMBR a Denver natural gas company A longtime fri end of Bush Evans also served as general chairman of his presidential camp aign Meanwhile ONeill headed Alcoa Inc AA a Pittsburgh aluminum company p rior to his appointment Bush Thursday called for two working groups from his cabinet and other agen cies to review matters related to events at Enron The investigations would be in addition to the criminal investigation launched by the Department of Justice One group from the Labor Commerce and Treasury Departments will look int o Enrons pension rules and regulations Another group drawing from the Tr easury Department the Federal Reserve the Securities and Exchange Commiss ion and the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission will investigate c

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday NEW YORK Dow Jones US Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill said Thursday t hat he would focus on regulatory reform as part of President George W Bush s newly announced probe of Enron Co ENE ONeill told Fox News Channel that he would be part of two task forces stem ming from the issue In the first he would join Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Labor Secretar y Elaine Chao to look at the impact of recent corporate bankruptcies on pen sion benefits In the second he would join Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Commo dities Futures and Trading Commission Chairman James E Newsome and Securit ies and Exchange Chairman Harvey Pitt in looking into disclosure rules ON eill said they will determine whether changes are needed to assure that in vestors and markets have all the information they are entitled to have to m ake our freemarket economy work properly In ordering the probe Bush particularly pointed at the loss of pension ben efits by employees at Enron which filed for bankruptcy last month As Enro ns stock collapsed employees were barred from selling the companys share s while the energy trading company was changing pension administrators and the accounts were frozen Asked for specific solutions ONeill suggested that the government needed to see if k and other pension accounts need to be locked up when new a dministrators come in We need to look at that and see if that is a sensible thing to do he sai d But beyond that the Treasury secretary refused to be pinned down on possib le remedies I think we need to do a study and we need to do analysis he said We need to do analysis before we do prescription Its a pretty good idea to figure out what disease exists before we start cutting off arms and legs he added ONeill also stressed that this effort is motivated by Bushs concern for E nrons employees The Treasury secretary said the president is just hurtin g a lot for people who apparently accumulated all of their savings in a k plan and then lost it all in a couple of months By Paul Rekoff Dow Jones Newswires Business Arthur Anderson is Under the Microscope Deborah Marchini CNNfn Before Hours c Copyright Federal Document Clearing House All Rights Reserved DEBORAH MARCHINI CNNfn ANCHOR BEFORE HOURS As weve been reporting this morning Arthur Anderson is under the microscope The accounting firm admitt ed yesterday employee had destroyed key records of its audits of Enron Im joined by Howard Schilit president of the Center for Financial Researc h and Analysis a Washington DC firm that provides research on just such incidences for institutional investors Thanks for being here this morning HOWARD SCHILIT CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH ANALYSIS Good morning MARCHINI First question I have for you is if documents were destroyed at Arthur Anderson the firms auditors was a crime necessarily committed SCHILIT Well its too early to conclude what happened and what did not why the records were destroyed But it certainly raises some very serious q uestions about the internal controls that the accounting firm When they we re destroyed Its certainly a very serious matter MARCHINI If these documents were destroyed after the company became the su bject of civil and criminal investigations that would be obstruction of ju stice I presume SCHILIT Well again Im an accountant by training not an attorney But t he role of the auditor is to raise assurance amongst investors in the compe tence of the company And auditors more than any other profession understa nds the importance of documentary evidence and the work papers are an esse ntial part of that MARCHINI So what youre saying here is that its suspicious they should have known better than to do this SCHILIT Oh I think this is a very serious situation which certainly is g oing to be investigated very closely MARCHINI Is there any precedent for the destruction of documents in a case like this where an audit is being questioned SCHILIT I have never heard of any situation where work papers have been de stroyed Very often when there had been frauds And there have been very ma jor frauds in the last few years INAUDIBLE for example in order to pie ce together what happened there were years of documents And in the case o f Enron its going to simply make the investigation much more difficult MARCHINI Make the investigation much more difficult for both the criminal the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission I presu me SCHILIT Thats right MARCHINI What are the potential penalties for Arthur Anderson if it turns out they have broken the law SCHILIT Again thats more of a legal question In the case of past invest igations by the SEC and Arthur Anderson in particular has had several of t hose recently One with Waste Management URL om The other with Sunbeam URL There are mo netary penalties and it could be very substantial The Securities and Exchange Commission may not permit this auditing firm to take on any new clients So it could be very substantial Monetary and cer tainly individuals involved who may have been obstructing justice there ce rtainly can be criminal penalties MARCHINI What are the ramifications for Arthur Andersons business You me ntioned the prospect that they might be barred from not taking on any new a uditing clients for awhile if it turns out theres a criminal violation B ut they also run a rather large management consulting business And I wond er what this does to their ability to win business now in the free markets SCHILIT Im sure its very difficult out there Again you probably want t o speak to people at the company to find out what their business wins INA UDIBLE have been But Id be very surprised if this were not a very diffic ult period for them to keep and win new accounts MARCHINI Understood Howard Schilit with the Center for Financial Researc h and Analysis TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT

harmed by such situations ONeill says Enron pension policies appear to have stayed within rules AFX News c by AFPExtel News Ltd WASHINGTON AFX Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill said it appears Enron Co

corporate pensions held as fixed untradeable investments in Enron stock He noted he has been tasked by President George Bush to look at possible re forms of the corporate pension system which currently allows companies to limit sales of company stock held within the funds to prevent further case s like Enron where many employees lost most of their personal savings Yesterday ONeill said

documents Potentially the most serious new development the Securities and Exchange Commission took the unusual st ep of saying they consider this extremely serious And boy are they right because if any of those documents were destroyed after investigations beg an it could be criminal obstruction of justice As for Attorney General John Ashcrofts stepping aside Democrats are sayin g he did the right thing in doing that He got something like in ca mpaign contributions from Enron for his senate campaign before he was atto rney general Also many attorneys in the US Attorneys Office in Houston are stepping aside A lot of them have family ties to Enron executives and Enron employees Thats of course where Enron is headquartered Some of the family members even lost money in Ks down there So its the Just ice Department is still sorting out exactly who is going to be conducting t his criminal investigation Those contacts with the White House or rather with the Bush administrati on are interesting Secretary ONeill got two calls from Ken Lay the Enron chairman ONeill says those were just informational calls He wasnt aske d for any help But Commerce Secretary Don Evans is saying that he was told by Lay that Lay would welcome any help in preserving Enrons bond rating w ith Moodys Now and Lays attorney is saying that he didnt ask for hel p In any case no help was forthcoming and the

Rights Reserved WASHINGTON AP Transformed in just one day from the nations biggest ban kruptcy to a major political controversy some of the players in the Enron affair are already giving conflicting versions of who said what to whom Did Enrons Ken Lay ask for help or didnt he when he called Commerce Secre tary Don Evans Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Fed Chairman Alan Green span in a fourday span in late October If Lay didnt ask for anything why did he call To give them a headsup about the situation at Enron company spokesman M ark Palmer said At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government nor did he in tend to leave any impression that he was asking for assistance said Palme r Evanss memory of his Oct phone call is that Lay said I would apprecia te any support you could give I did nothing and the decision to do nothing was a nobrainer Evans sa id in a brief interview Thursday with The Associated Press ONeill insists Lay didnt ask for anything but the context of their conve rsation is intriguing because the two men discussed another financial disas ter in which Greenspans intervention was very much in evidence the nearf ailure in of a Connecticutbased hedge fund Long Term Capital Managem ent Greenspans spokesman Dave Skidmore declined to say whether Lay asked for anything Evans said the context for the call from Lay was the ongoing review of Enro ns financial status by Moodys the bondrating firm A severe lowering of Houstonbased Enrons bond rating would mean that billion in company debt would come due Enron would have to pay what it ow ed in cash if it could not pay in stock which was plummeting in value Palmer the Enron spokesman says he doesnt know whether the Moodys revie w was the subject of the LayEvans conversation but that the company was co ncerned because the bondrating firm was taking a long time and we were wa nting a decision In the end Moodys dropped Enrons rating creating still more trouble for the worlds largest energy trader as it headed toward collapse The compan y went to bankruptcy court on Dec Lay spoke to Evans the day after a Sunday Oct phone call with ONeill and a phone call the previous Friday with Greenspan The chairman did nothing in response to the call It would have been inapp ropriate said Skidmore the Greenspan spokesman Skidmore refused to discuss the contents of the Greenspan call but in one of Lays two conversations with ONeill the discussion turned to the case of the Connecticut hedge fund that had been in danger of failure until Gree nspan and other Federal Reserve officials pressured several large financial institutions to bail it out Fed officials feared severe harm to the countrys financial system if Long Term Capital Management had been allowed to crumble It nearly tanked durin g the Asian financial crisis in the fall of ONeill expressed his concern about the experience that Long Term Capital went through when Long Term Capital went bankrupt said White House spokes man Ari Fleischer In an interview with CNBC ONeill said that after one of their conversatio ns I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak with the Enron people which he did so we could satisfy ourselves that the Enro n affairs were not going to have a negative impact on the US capital mark ets So why did Lay make the flurry of calls if he didnt want anything He just felt an obligation to give them information important to the marke ts and perhaps to the government said Palmer While the information may have been important the only action resulting fr om it appears to have been a decision by the two Cabinet secretaries not to tell President Bush With Lay at the helm Enron and its executives had be en George W Bushs most generous campaign donors over the course of two Te xas governors races and the presidential campaign When did Bush find out of the conversations between Lay Evans and ONeill This morning Fleischer said Thursday AP business writer Brad Foss in New York

the Justice Department investigates t he politically connected company The White House revealed Thursday that Enron officials sought the administr ations help last fall shortly before the energytrading company melted dow n along with the life savings of many of its employees Several administrat ion officials and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan received tele phone calls from the Enron chairman Kenneth Lay Enrons auditing firm whose work is under investigation by federal regulat ors disclosed that its employees had destroyed a significant number of d ocuments which a congressional source said was thousands of pages relat ed to Houstonbased Enron In another startling development in a day brimming with them Attorney Gene ral John Ashcroft disqualified himself from Justices criminal inquiry into Enrons conduct The energytrading company donated thousands of dollars t o Ashcrofts Senate campaign in In Houston Enrons hometown US At torney Michael Shelby announced that his entire office disqualified itself from the investigation because he and other local prosecutors have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankr uptcy Bush who counts Enron among his biggest political contributors pledged to pursue aggressively the investigation into whether the company defrauded i nvestors including k plan holders by concealing vital information ab out its finances Ken Lay is a supporter the president said But what anybodys going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure th at workers are protected Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill said Friday On first blush it looks like Enron operated within the rules and regulations with regard to how they managed their k plan and if they did then we need to look and see i f there are appropriate changes we could make He was interviewed on ABCs Good Morning America Bush said he saw Lay twice last year but they did not discuss Enrons fina ncial problems Lay sought help last fall from Commerce Secretary Don Evans Bushs chief political fundraiser and confidant and contacted ONeill a bout the firms financial problems ONeill and Evans said Thursday Enron also revealed that Lay called Greenspan the independent Fed chairman abou t the companys problems Lay denied that he sought help from the officials Enron said Lays calls t o ONeill Evans and Greenspan were simply to give them a headsup about Enrons problems He felt an obligation to let them know what was going on Enron said in a statement At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government nor did he intend to leave the impression that he was asking for assistance Dave Skidmore a spokesman for the Federal Reserve said Lay contacted Gree nspan on Oct and the chairman did nothing in response to the call It would have been inappropriate Skidmore would not characterize the conver sation Lay also first reached out to Evans on Oct The two eventually spoke three days later The first of Lays two conversations with ONeill w as Sunday Oct Enrons bankruptcy already the subject of criminal civil and congressiona l investigations threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmi re even as Bushs approval ratings reach nearrecord levels because of the war against terror It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to col lapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings said Rep Henry Waxman DCalif Firing back Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid partisa n witch hunts endless investigations or fishing expeditions Democrats ho pe to make a political issue out of the administrations many ties to Enron The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once pose d to the scandaltainted Clinton White House Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate Fleischer sa id no He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired law yers And there was a development reminiscent of Clintons Whitewater missing do cuments

know whether its direct ive to preserve documents demanded by government investigators was violated At the Securities and Exchange Commission already investigating Andersens auditing work for Enron Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said destruct ion of documents was an extremely serious matter but would not deter the SEC from pursuing its probe As for the companys contacts last fall administration officials said Lay told Evans on Oct that he would welcome any support to help the company deal with a bondrating firm that was considering downgrading Enron Enron s credit rating was critical because if lowered billion in debt wou ld come due Of that amount billion previously had been hidden in par tnerships that were created to keep debt off Enrons books In a brief interview Evans said Lay told him I would appreciate any supp ort you could give Evans said Lay was not more specific In response to t he plea Evans said I did nothing Evans said he didnt tell the president about the call because I didnt th ink he needed to know In one of two conversations with ONeill Lay discussed a past example in w hich the Federal Reserve pressured several large financial institutions to bail out a Connecticut hedge fund Fleischer said The calls to Evans and ONeill came after investors and the public learned of the extent of Enrons problems when the company posted major losses Oct Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec after months of conjecture about its fin ances Other EnronBush administration ties Bush raised nearly in political action committee money and indivi dual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign Enron also gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bushs two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas Independent analyses show that Enron employees

Jepsen wants it explained again it will be explained again Jepsen who first questioned the CRRAEnron relationship last month called a news conference at his Capitol office Thursday to repeat his criticism Its incomprehensible to me they put all their eggs in one basket Jepsen said Jepsen has questioned why the state made a million upfront lumpsum p ayment in the deal with Enron The company formed in and grew into the nations seventhbiggest company in revenue by buying electricity from gen erators and selling it to consumers Enrons collapse will force CRRA to raise by as much as percent the cost charged to towns to dispose of trash Jepsen said Wright disputed Jepsens cost estimate I cant see that under any circums tances he said Jepsen has called the CRRAEnron deal the largest loss of public money in C onnecticut history State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigat ing The US Justice Department said Wednesday it had begun a criminal investig ation of Enron Corp In

recyclable trash from towns struck a good deal with Enron for the use of a acre site in Hartford Wright said The site inc ludes a trashtoenergy plant The deal with Enron was part of a complex transaction that also involved Co nnecticut Light Power Co which owned the acre site in Hartfords Sou th Meadows area Under the states electricity deregulation law CLP was mandated to divest all its powergenerating assets including the South Meadows property To divest CLP had to buy its way out of a contract to buy steam power fro m CRRA That contract had years left The buyout price was million Using state bond funds given to power companies to help them buy out of con tracts and divest holdings under deregulation CLP sent million to En ron and million to CRRA The money given to Enron was payment for the company taking over the obliga tions of the steam purchasing contract with CRRA that CLP relinquished CRRA used part of its million to buy the acre site clean pollution from the site and insure the property Wright responding to Jepsens criticism that CRRA made a mistake by failin g to require Enron to post collateral or other security said such a practi ce does not exist in the industry He refused to rule out the possibility that CRRA will seek a bailout from t he state Wed be crazy to say no to anything he said Dean Pagani a spokesman for Gov John Rowland said the governor is not wo rried that CRRAs financial loss will jeopardize the states finances Hes confident that CRRA has a plan to work its way out of this situation he said The recycling agency is politically well connected Its chairman Peter Ell ef is cochief of staff for the Republican governor Rep Brian J Flahert y RWatertown is a spokesman for the agency and Sen Thomas Gaffey DMer iden heads the agencys

will be critical to a deal to sell Enron Corps trading business because it has been the most profitable in the company The unit remains solvent with more than million in cash and more than million

a white knight of its own he said We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houstons part with respect to the auction But if that was to fall through Canada would attempt to find its own white knight so to speak We had numerous e xpressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time Houstonbased Enron Corp was negotiating yesterday with at least six poten

Andersen LLP that a significant but undetermined number of documents related to the company had been destroyed Mr Milnthorp said the investigation has nothing to do with Enron Canada The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent a nd reemerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts its

officials confirmed the company unsucces sfully sought an thhour rescue The case is already drawing comparisons to the Whitewater scandal which do gged former president Bill Clinton and triggered a million US inves tigation by a special counsel into the failed Arkansas realestate venture Enrons legal and financial problems have also raised questions whether the Bush administration can conduct an objective investigation into one of its largest and most loyal political contributors Late last year and with the Houstonbased company teetering on the brink of failure chairman Kenneth Lay a key campaign donor to President George W Bush and other top Republicans talked to Treasury Secretary Paul ONe ill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans about a possible rescue the White House disclosed

didnt have a broader economic impact Bush raised nearly in political action committee money and individ ual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign making the compa ny one of his biggest

creditors runs to pages but senior executives were able to sell their stock before the price plummeted The company is believed to be the largest donor to Mr Bushs campaign funds over the course of his

energy taskforce met Enron executives at least six times with one meeting only six days before the companys troubles became public in October The administration however insists that the meetings covered only policy matters and not Enrons financial position The White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was peppered with questions yeste rday about whether Mr Bush and Mr Cheney were aware of the

hot seat Accounting giant says Enron audit papers destro yed Delroy Alexander Tribune staff writer Chicago Tribune North Sports Final N Copyright by the Chicago Tribune A Chicagobased accounting giant that has faced significant embarrassments recently now may face unprecedented scrutiny Andersen took center stage in a potential scandal Thursday after disclosing that its employees had destroyed a significant number of documents relat ed to the sudden collapse of Enron Corp For a company that has weathered damaging disclosures over its audits of Ho ustonbased Waste Management Inc and Sunbeam Corp the latest brouhaha co uld be a further threat to credibility This is a deeply troubling development It should never have happened sa id Billy Tauzin RLa whose House Energy and Commerce Committee is inves tigating Enrons collapse Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stup idity should be fired anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subver t our investigation should be prosecuted Observers said destruction of the files made no sense and that the records might have provided clues for investigators probing the Enron case the la rgest bankruptcy in US history I have never in my life heard of people in an accounting firm doing someth ing like this said Lynn Turner a former chief accountant for the Securit ies and Exchange Commission People in these accounting firms are welledu cated professionals and supposedly well aware of their professional respons ibility to the public For its part Andersen said in a statement that its company policy require d in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents However officials added that the firm is still working to gather the fact s and determine appropriate disciplinary actions against employees Several observers suggested that the missing files likely were noticed only after the SEC issued subpoenas in midDecember calling for Andersen to han d over documents related to its Enron audits Andersen said the documents were discarded months before it received the su bpoenas After receiving the SEC subpoena the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents At this time we have not been able to determine whe ther that instruction was violated the firm said Andersen said that millions of Enron documents still exist and that it had successfully retrieved some of the deleted electronic files It is continui ng efforts to fully learn and understand all the facts related to this iss ue according to the statement Auditors typically keep records for years experts say Most top accounting firms keep records for more than seven years after work is completed in c ase of lawsuits It also is customary for audit firms to scan and file client documents at a central electronic database or warehouse according to analysts Once that is completed original hard copies are often destroyed Policy suspended Andersen said it had suspended its current records management policy effec tive immediately and instructed all partners and personnel to retain all ex isting documents until further notice Furthermore Andersen said it has asked former US Sen John Danforth to r eview its policies and recommend potential improvements Andersen has been in the spotlight before for its audits In June Andersen reached a million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Houstonba sed Waste Management Inc Andersen and the waste hauler also paid mill ion in to settle classaction lawsuits relating to the case Last year Andersen agreed to pay million to settle class action liti gation brought on behalf of shareholders of another client Sunbeam Corp which had misstated its financial results during the s However the record payout for audit problems remains million paid by Ernst Young to Cendant Corp shareholders in Public concern over the veracity of audits has heightened since Enrons deb acle with regulators focusing on Andersens performance The news is a blow not only to Andersen but also to the profession which said it would come up with new rules to help regulate itself after Enrons problems emerged Just last week the selfregulatory process was called into question after rival Big Five firm Deloitte Touche gave Andersens auditing practice a c lean bill of health Problems for claim The news may also present problems for Andersens claim that it was misled by Enron executives experts said In midDecember Andersens chief executive Joseph Berardino told the fir st congressional hearing into the collapse that it warned Enron about poss ible illegal acts saying the energytrading giant withheld crucial data a bout its complex finances Some observers warned that the credibility of that claim may now have been damaged as a result of the missing documents Essentially theyve already claimed that management committed a fraud on them said Mark Cheffers a former PriceWaterhouse auditor who now runs Ac countingMalpracticecom a liability training Web site that caters to accountants Evidence that documents have been destroyed that relate to the very events that are under investigation represents a terrible blow for the defense th at management misled them he added Business Andersen gap starts shredding trust all around David Greising Chicago Tribune North Sports Final N Copyright by the Chicago Tribune Now the Enron debacle has its own minute gap The famous gap arose during the Watergate investigation when part of a trou blesome Richard Nixon conversation was accidentally erased from a White H ouse tape Enrons auditor Chicagobased Andersen disclosed its own smelly blank spa ce Thursday Andersen employees created a huge gap when they destroyed thou sands of files that arose from Andersens Enron audits File shredders and computer delete keys went into overdrive from September to November of last year Strange coincidence Thats the period of Enrons straightline depreciation from worlds largest energy trader to nations largest bankruptcy Think the Watergate comparison overreaches Well I doubt a president will fall because of it Shredded documents at an accounting firm hardly mean sc andal will reach the oval office As scandals go this looks more like a Teapot Dome About oil and money fir st and politics second Even so at this early stage the Enron case has stronger connections at hi gher levels than the scandal that started as a thirdrate burglary Atty Gen John Ashcroft and a top aide stepped out of the criminal investi gation because Ashcroft got in Enron contributions during his senate campaign The entire US attorneys office in Houston recused itsel f because of family and professional ties to Enron Other administration officials took Enron money too President Bush heads the list with million in donations from Enron Chairman Ken Lay and comp any employees since Money buys access Well find out over time if it bought improper influence Ken Lay last fall contacted Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Commerce Se cretary Don Evans as Enron broke down around him He reportedly asked ONei ll about a possible governmentorchestrated bailout like the one that limit ed damage from the collapse of Long Term Capital Management Enron didnt get a bailout But there surely will be other influence questi ons as the Enron saga unfolds For example what emerged from Lays private meetings with Vice President C heney during development of the administrations energy policy What did La y want from Cheney anywayextra room in the strategic petroleum reserve w here Andersen could store damaging Enron documents An administrations first instinct is to minimize the scandal and deflect a ttention The Bush White House chose to spin this scandal as a possible oversight fai lure and a sign regulations cant keep up with an increasingly complex eco nomy This is not about Enron Treasurys ONeill told Lou Dobbs on CNN This is about making sure that the rules and regulations that govern the way our economic system works are worthy of the conditions in the market today Nice try But it wont work any better for ONeill than it did for Andersen chief Joe Berardino who tried a similar argument late last month when he first stepped into the sights of one of the congressional committees invest igating the Enron mess Id say Berardino and ONeill are reading from the same playbook Except a ny playbooks Andersen had probably have been shredded by now There are loopholes in oversight particularly in the mostly self regulate d accounting industry But ONeill and Berardino are dead wrong This scand al certainly is about Enron Its about thousands of employees who have lost their jobs and pensions In vestors who have lost their money Executives who dumped their stock just before the scandal hit And thats just for starters Andersen already was at the heart of the scandal And with Thursdays revel ations its clear that the Bush administration will be kneedeep in discus singor maybe denyingits Enron questions for a good long time Heres another memorable Watergate reference The toothpaste really came ou t of the tube Thursday Its never going back in For President Bushs administration and for Chica gos Andersen the key question now is how big a mess it will make Contact NATIONAL EXPERTS SAY WILLFUL INTENT TO DECEIVE IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN FINANCIAL FR AUD PROSECUTION A TOUGH CHORE ROBERT MANOR AND MELITA MARIE GARZA CHICAGO TRIBUNE Pittsburgh PostGazette REGION A Copyright Government attorneys face major obstacles in their investigation of Enron C orp legal experts say and while prosecution is possible it could take m any months to find evidence of crime The Justice Department the Securities and Exchange Commission and other au thorities are examining the collapse of Enron an energy conglomerate that entered bankruptcy late last year Enron had failed to disclose heavy debts it had taken on through a complex series of partnership agreements leadin g investors to believe the company was financially strong Despite Enrons spectacular downfall experts say it is extremely hard to p rove criminal wrongdoing when corporate executives engage in deceptive acco unting practices Criminal liability requires a willful attempt to deceive said Jeffrey Go rdon a professor at Columbia Law School Financial fraud cases are very d ifficult to prosecute because it is difficult to prove to a jury that the i rregularities were willful in their intent to deceive While prosecutors may find it tough going to develop a case against Enron e xecutives the government does have vast resources to tap The highprofile nature of Enrons failure and the fact that executives sold billion worth of stock before the company announced its accounting problems mean s investigators are likely to use every tool to determine what happened and who is responsible Even in the absence of criminal charges the Justice Departments moves cou ld have a strong impact in Washington embroiling the Bush administration a nd others with ties to Enron in a firestorm of damaging disclosures Enron once the nations seventh largest company in terms of its stock capi talization was the leading marketmaker in energy It bought power from ge nerators and sold it to consumers It also traded in coal fiberoptic band width plastic and other commodities The Justice Department is interested in partnerships Enron set up allegedl y to keep debt off its balance sheet and out of the eyes of investors Enro n recently admitted it had overstated profits by million beginning in They created limited partnerships where Enron was the master partner in co ntrol of the money said Rob Plaza a stock analyst with Morningstar The n using Enron stock as collateral they went out and found investors to le nd the partnership money The money went to Enron but the debt remained at least in Enrons way of accounting with the partnership Plaza said the arrangement disclosed onl y late last year was typical of Houston based Enrons corporate behavior But that does not mean Enron executives are guilty of any crime and if the y are that the government can prove it to a jury There may not be a clear rule of law that applies to any particular accou nting scheme said Douglas Baird a professor at the University of Chicago Law School These arent very well defined offenses Baird spoke in general and not specifically of Enron It is rare for a corp orate executive to be led away in handcuffs even in major instances of fra ud A new problem for investigators emerged

lawyer said the loss of the Enron documents could hobble the governments case If Andersen were withholding documents and they were sloppy that makes it harder for the government to use them as a witness said Brad Bennett an SEC criminal defense lawyer in Washington DC The defense lawyers for E nron could use the loss of the documents to suggest that Andersen was part and parcel of the conspiracy But John Coffee a Columbia University Law School professor who testified b efore Congress on the Enron case said the government can still use Anderse n The source of testimony most damaging

opened criminal investigation into Enrons failure Ashcroft had received campaign contributions from Enron during his unsucces sful reelection bid for a US Senate seat from Missouri In Houston US Atty Michael Shelby said many prosecutors in his office including himself have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankruptcy For the first time the White House disclosed that Lay a close friend of t he president had called Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill and Commerce Secre tary Don Evans last fall to confirm that Enron was heading into bankruptcy He also raised the prospect that the collapse could have major financial implications around the world similar to those from the demise of a hedge fund LongTerm Capital Management ONeill told CNN that in the conversations on Oct and Nov Lay did no t seek government assistance despite making reference to the investment com pany which was the subject of a private bailout engineered by the Federal Reserve Board ONeill said he and Evans agreed that the administration sho uld not come to Enrons rescue The two Cabinet officers did not tell Bush of their conversations White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Enron revealed that Lay also called Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about the companys problems In a statement the company said Lay felt a n obligation to let Greenspan ONeill and Evans

been pushing the White House to discl ose more about its contacts with Enron said the administration could have done more to help the company and its workers The White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did no thing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings he said I am deeply troubled that the White Hou se stood by and let this happen to thousands of families White House sympathy At the White House Bush also expressed his sympathy for the plight of the families The administration is deeply concerned about its effects on

liability requires a willful attempt to deceive said Jeffrey Go rdon a professor at Columbia University Law School Financial fraud cases are very difficult to prosecute because it is difficult to prove to a jury that the irregularities were willful in their intent to deceive While prosecutors may find it tough going to develop a case against Enron e xecutives the government does have vast resources to tap The highprofile nature of Enrons failureand the fact that executives sold billion wo rth of stock before the company announced its accounting problemsmeans in vestigators are likely to use every tool to determine what happened and who is responsible Even in the absence of criminal charges the Justice Departments moves cou ld have a strong impact in Washington embroiling the Bush

The money went to Enron but the debt remained at least in Enrons way of accounting with the partnership Plaza said the arrangement disclosed onl y late last year was typical of Houston based Enrons corporate behavior Almost everything was a closely guarded secret Plaza said You had a co mpany of sharks In their culture they pushed everything to the limit But that does not mean Enron executives are guilty of crime and if they ar e that the government can prove it to a jury There may not be a clear rule of law that applies to any particular accou nting scheme said Douglas Baird a professor at the University of Chicago Law School These arent very welldefined offenses Baird spoke in gener al and not specifically of Enron Rarely are corporate executives led away in handcuffs even in major

financial and political ties to the Bush adminis tration and other government officials are already complicating a nascent c riminal probe by the Justice Department into the bankrupt energy company And Enrons entrenched network of connections at the White House and on Cap itol Hillforged by political contributions lobbying and personal tiesa re making it difficult for politicians to keep at arms length the growing furor engulfing the company The most obvious example is Atty Gen John Ashcrofts announcement Thursda y that he and his chief of staff David Ayres are recusing themselvesrem oving themselves from any involvement in what will surely be one of the Jus tice Departments highestprofile criminal investigations of the year The reason Ashcroft and Ayres didnt want anyone to think that theyor th e Justice Departmentwould go easy on Enron because the companys chief ex ecutive Kenneth L Lay other Enron employees and the companys political action committee had contributed more than in to Ashcrofts fa iled senatorial campaign which Ayres managed Ashcroft insisted that he has not been involved in any aspect of the Enron investigation He said his deputy Larry Thompson would take his place if and when highlevel consultations are needed In Houston Enrons hometown US Atty Michael T Shelby recused not only himself Thursday but also his entire office of federal prosecutors who we re expected to play a prominent role in the criminal investigation In Shelbys case the recusals came for the opposite reason Too many prose cutorshimself includedhad friends and family members who had

who lost substantial amounts of money as a result of the collapse of the company Shelby said in an interview In my case its my wifes brother who works there Whether they fear being perceived as going too easy or too hard on Enron t he prosecutors ties to the company could well hamper the investigation in its early stages some Justice Department officials and outside legal exper ts said Thursday Because of the likelihood of conflicts in the Houston off ice the Justice Department this week convened a task force out of its Wash ington headquarters in an effort to determine whether any laws were broken as the company collapsed late last year shredding billions of investor dol lars and costing thousands of jobs This investigation needs to go forward and it needs to go forward in an e xpeditious and focused way Shelby said And there needs to be a seamless transition between this office and the Department of Justice Enron has long sought to be influential in Texas and Washington and it has succeeded through political contributions to both parties extensive lobby ing and personal ties Although few if any elected officials have said they will recuse themselv es from the congressional investigations into the Enron collapse many have connections to the company The most obvious example is Sen Phil Gramm of Texas the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee which is investigating the Enron matter Gramms wife Wendy has served on Enrons board of directors And Enron has deep links to President Bush and others in his administration It was disclosed Thursday that Lay called two Cabinet members Treasury Sec retary Paul H ONeill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans late last year to discuss the companys financial problems ONeill through a spokeswoman a cknowledged being an acquaintance of Lays Evans a former oil company exe cutive has longstanding connections to the Texas political and business w orlds as well Overall Enrons political action

Hamilton editor of the Publi c Accounting Report a trade publication Usually in the case of an ongoin g client relationship you find it useful to keep nearly all documents he said And if theres even a

Lay also told ONeill that Enron was heading to bankruptcy Fleischer sai d ONeill received calls from Lay on Oct and Nov said Treasury spokes woman Michele Davis It was on Oct that Enron made its stunning disclos ure of a million US thirdquarter loss In a separate phone call to Commerce Secretary Don Evans Lay similarly wor ried that the company might have to default on its obligations He brought to the secretarys attention that he was having problems with his bond rat ing and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector Fleischer sa id After that conversation Evans spoke to

bankruptcy in US history is being investigated by the Secur ities and Exchange Commission Associated Press Business Outlook Enronpensions The Independent London FOREIGN Copyright Independent Newspapers UK Limited THE US President George W Bush has ordered a review of US pension regulat ions following the collapse of Enron One of the most disturbing aspects of the insolvency was that employees had more than half their pension fund as sets invested in Enron shares which are now worthless Worse due to an administrative change in the scheme employees were preven ted from divesting their Enron holdings during a crucial day period of b ad news in late October and early November when the stock lost nearly a thi rd of its value Forget the now active criminal investigation into false ac counting at Enron The real scandal is that as directors piled out of the s tock they had been so active in promoting their downtrodden staff were loc ked in to face the music Many employees have thus suffered a double blow of both losing their jobs a nd the great bulk of their retirement nest egg In Britains last big corpo rate scandal Robert Maxwell stole from the pension fund in order to prop u p his ailing business empire but in the end no one suffered as badly as En ron employees seem likely to Nearly all the stolen Maxwell millions were e ventually recovered and job losses were minimal The lax audit banking and management practices that allowed the Maxwell sc andal to happen were much mocked on the other side of the Atlantic at the t ime in apparent disregard of the mote in Americas own eye Indeed in rec ent years it has become fashionable to praise the k pension plans that s anction such reckless investment in the employers own stock Many respecta ble British voices have been heard to lobby for the same thing here Not much danger of that now As it happens Enron is by no means the worst case of incest in the pension fund CocaCola General Electric and McDonal ds all have more than per cent of their k pension plans invested in their own stock and jolly proud of it they were too until the Enron collap se so painfully demonstrated the downside of having all your eggs in one ba sket On this side of the Atlantic where on the whole we are much more cau tious about the way our pension money is invested its hard to understand how such a high risk strategy could ever have been allowed In part its cultural US companies actively encourage employees to buy int o every aspect of the sales pitch And although the k plans are meant to empower employees to make their own decisions on where their pensions are invested in practice they tend to offer only a very limited range of optio ns prominent among which is naturally the companys own stock In Enrons case the employers pension contribution was made not in cash as it is in Britain but stock For every dollar invested there would be cents of Enron stock Again this is pretty much standard practice across a large num ber of big US corporations A painful period of adjustment is now in prospect as new laws are introduce d limiting exposure to any one asset to say per cent of the total The excesses of the last bull market are not so easily buried it would seem NATIONAL ENRON MESS GETS MESSIER DONOR ASKED WHITE HOUSE TO HELP WARD OFF BANKRUPTCY DANA MILBANK AND PETER BEHR THE WASHINGTON POST Pittsburgh

hours yesterday it sent the White House into a fullscale effort to contain the potential damage to President Bush at a ti me when he wants to focus on the war on terrorism and the flagging economy The White House spent much of the day trying to distance the president from a torrent of bad news about the fall of the Houston energy conglomerate Although no one has suggested that Bush has done anything wrong the connec tions between his presidency and Enron are uncomfortably close The company s chairman Kenneth L Lay has been a close friend of Bush for many years and Lay and other Enron executives have contributed more to Bush over his political career than anyone else an amount exceeding Those connections were made vividly clear yesterday when the White House di sclosed that Lay sought government aid last fall from Treasury Secretary Pa ul ONeill and from Bushs best friend and presidential campaign chairman Commerce Secretary Donald L Evans The day began with Bush expressing sympathy for Enron employees whose retir ement accounts were wiped out by the collapse of the companys stock and e nded with calls from Congress for a criminal investigation of the companys auditors for destroying documents Throughout the day White House officials denied that Bush had been aware o f the companys precarious finances or had ever been asked to come to Enron s rescue But on Capitol Hill Democrats were already beginning to ask of the preside nt What did he know and when did he know it And questions were being ra ised about whether the criminal inquiry should be led by a special counsel rather than by the Justice Department because Attorney General John Ashcro ft received in campaign contributions from Enron and Lay according to the Center for Responsive Politics Ashcroft and his chief of staff recused themselves from the criminal invest igation that will attempt to determine whether the company or its executive s committed fraud before Enron went bankrupt But critics still questioned whether the department which includes many other political appointees cou ld independently investigate the company Scandal pieces in place Just as Enrons collapse was stunning because it occurred so quickly and so completely the latest disclosures have reawakened Washingtons nowfamili ar scandal machinery which had remained practically dormant since Sept Washington may once again

Texas corporati on led by Bushs most generous campaign contributor files the largest ban kruptcy petition in American history A handful of Enron executives are abl e to sell billion worth of the companys stock before its collapse but thousands of employees are barred from selling losing their lifes savings and their retirement accounts And just this week the White House disclosed that Enron

else the accounting firm that audited Enrons books Arthur Andersen LLP disclosed yesterday that a significant but undetermin ed number of documents related to the company had been destroyed This is the perfect storm said Phil Schiliro the press secretary for Re p Henry A Waxman DCalif Its the biggest bankruptcy in American corpo rate history a bankruptcy where a small number of executives enriched th emselves to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars while thousands of employees were left with worthless stock And in Enron is the most in fluential company in Washington When you piece it all together there are many questions that need to be answered Bush said yesterday that he had never discussed Enrons financial woes with Lay who has supported Bush politically since his unsuccessful campaign fo r Congress in Bush said he last saw Lay in Texas at an April fund raiser for former first lady Barbara Bushs literacy foundation At the tim e Enrons share price was nearly a

Waxman said I suspect there were dozens of conversations between administration officia ls and Enron representatives during the past year The public and Congress should have this information especially since it is now clear the White Ho use had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their li fe savings National Desk THE NATION Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records Finance The admission a ngers investigators of the energy firms messy bankruptcy Its chief sought help from two Cabinet members the White House reveals RICHARD SIMON JAMES GERSTENZANG TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON The accounting firm Andersen acknowledged Thursday that it de stroyed a significant number of documents related to its audit of Enron C orp as the White House disclosed that Enrons chief executive contacted B ush Cabinet members for help when the energy company was collapsing Treasury Secretary Paul H ONeill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans said th ey listened to Enron Chairman Kenneth L Lays description of the firms di re financial problems last fall but took no action Both revelations deepened the controversy over Enrons sudden failureone that has financial legal and political overtones The disclosure by Anders en until recently known as Arthur Andersen prompted outrage in Congress a nd could complicate federal investigations into the massive bankruptcy Andersen said in a statement that it had disposed of a significant but und etermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence rela ting to Enron Investigators could not immediately say what documents were destroyed A company spokesman said the matter is under review and would no t say whether the destruction was accidental or intentional The company sa id millions of documents related to Enron still exist A congressional aide said Andersen notified investigators that potentially thousands of records were destroyed in September October and November I nvestigators plan to meet with the head of Andersens Houston office next w eek and question him on the matter Despite the administrations efforts to distance itself from the Enron fias co the companys huge political footprint continued to create problems At ty Gen John Ashcroft his chief of staff and the entire US attorneys o ffice in Houston where Enron is based recused themselves from the crimina l probe of the company because of potential conflicts of interest Ashcroft received campaign contributions from Enron for his failed Sen ate campaign and the US attorney in Houston said many on his staff have family members who could be affected by the Enron bankruptcy The fallout touched the White House as President Bush ordered senior offic ials to recommend reforms of the pension system and to examine federal rule s governing corporate disclosures Investigators are probing whether compan y officials withheld financial information from investors who along with e mployees in the company pension plan suffered huge losses in the firms co llapse Ken Lay is a supporter the president said of the Enron executive a gene rous donor to Bushs political campaigns But what anybodys going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enr on bankruptcy to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that w orkers are protected The latest twist in the Enron saga came one day after the Justice Departmen t launched a criminal probe of the company investigating among other matt ers whether Enron knew of problems but failed to disclose them In congres sional testimony last month the head of Andersen said he had warned Enron that the company might be guilty of possible illegal acts for withholding financial information from auditorsan allegation Enron denied Andersens destruction of records drew angry reactions from members of Cong ress investigating the accounting methods used by the auditor Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa of the House Energy and Commerce Commi ttee called the loss deeply troubling and vowed to investigate It should never have happened Tauzin said Clearly this is a very serio us matter Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be f ired anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subvert our investigati on should be prosecuted The list of problems and problem people involved in this entire tawdry aff air seems destined to grow said Rep John D Dingell of Michigan the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee The seriousness of t his matter cries out for further investigation Stephen Cutler director of the Securities and Exchange Commissions enforc ement division called the record destruction an extremely serious matter but added that it will not deter us from pursuit of our investigation and will be included within the scope of our investigation The SEC is investigating whether Enron used loopholes in accounting regulat ions to hide debt In addition Congress is looking into Andersens interpr etation of accounting rules that allowed Enron to exclude losses at several partnerships from its reporting Enron and Andersen dispute who is to blam e for the faulty accounting On Oct Enron reported a thirdquarter loss of million and disclos ed a billion reduction in shareholder equity On Nov it announced it had overstated its earnings by million during the last four years sending the companys stock tumbling from more than a share a year earl ier to less than a dollar The meltdown cost more than employees thei r jobs and destroyed the retirement savings of employees with companyspons ored savings plans Because as the company said the retirement plan was changing administrato rs those employees were locked out of selling their shares at the time the stock began its most precipitous descent However many executives managed to sell their shares just before the stocks plunge The company filed for protection from its creditors Dec At the White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called ONeill a nd Evans separately reporting his concerns about whether or not Enron wou ld be able to meet its obligations ONeill said in the two calls he receivedon Oct and Nov according to an aideLay expressed concern about the implications for the capital m arkets and also that a possible downgrading of the companys credit rating might ruin a pending merger prospect Lay did not ask for anything specific ONeill said As secretary of the T reasury with responsibility for the US capital markets I get calls every day from the big players in the world warning about important financial e vents he told CNN But Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay did draw a comparison with Long Term Capital Management a large investment firm that was saved from c ollapse in by a federally orchestrated private bailout Lay expressed a concern that if Enron went bankrupt it would affect the c redit markets the way the Long Term Capital Management problems a few years earlier affected the credit markets that it would have ripple effects thr oughout the whole banking sector she said Davis said ONeill never discussed a bailout or any other kind of aid for E nron Evans said Lay was hoping for highlevel support Fleischer said that the secretaries decided not to inform Bush of the calls and that Bush did not learn of them until Thursday morning Fleischer said Evans and ONeill handled the matter appropriately Communic ation is not a wrongdoing What took place here was they received phone ca lls and took no action However Rep Henry A Waxman DLos Angeles said the calls show that the administration had advance word of Enrons collapse and did nothing to prot ect shareholders or employees Fleischer dismissed the criticism as partisan rhetoric what people have b ecome so used to in Washington which is a politically charged politically motivated effort to blame one party or to look only at one party Enron he said has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to both parties Bush said he had not spoken with Lay about his companys financial problems and had not seen him since last spring when they met at a Houston theater where the presidents mother was the sponsor of a bookreading fundraiser by celebrity authors Lay was a socalled pioneer in Bushs presidential campaign which meant he committed to raising at least Lay also personally contributed more than to the Republican Nation al Committee during the election cycle part of overall donations from company employees and directors to the RNC that exceeded million Enr on gave to help pay for Bushs inauguration In that cycle Enron employees and directors gave to the Democratic National Committee Lay made no personal contributions to the DNC In calling for an examination of the pension rules Bush said he directed O Neill Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to determine the effects of the current law on hardworking Americans and to come up with recommendatio ns of how to reform the system to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as the result of a bankruptcy for example In addition he said that ONeill along with the SEC the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would study corporate disclosu re rules and regulations in light of the Enron bankruptcy There needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure that the American stockholder or any stockholder is protected Bush said Enron grew from a small naturalgas pipeline operator into the worlds larg est energytrading operation At its peak it handled in wholesale deal s for electricity gas and other energy products The company championed energy deregulation and tried to influence the way C alifornia structured its energy markets and how the state steered through i ts

wants to focus on the war on terroris m and the flagging economy The White House spent much of the day trying to distance the president from a torrent of bad news about the fall of Enron the Houston energy conglome rate Although no one has suggested that Mr Bush has done anything wrong the co nnections between his presidency and Enron are uncomfortably close The com panys chairman Kenneth L Lay has been a close friend of Mr Bush for ma ny years and Mr Lay and other Enron executives have contributed more mone y to Mr Bush over his political career than anyone else an amount exceedi ng Mr Lay contributed an additional for the Bush inaugu ral committee Those connections were made vividly clear today when the White House disclo sed that Mr Lay discussed his companys precarious financial

White House officials denied that Mr Bush had been awa re of the companys troublesome finances or had ever been asked to come to its rescue But on Capitol Hill Democrats were already beginning to ask of the preside nt What did he know and when did he know it And questions were being raised about whether a criminal inquiry into Enrons collapse should be led by a special counsel rather than by the Justice Department because Attorn ey General John Ashcroft received in campaign contributions from En ron and Mr Lay according to the Center for Responsive Politics Mr Ashcroft as well as his chief of staff recused themselves from the cr iminal investigation which will try to determine whether the company or it s executives committed fraud before it went bankrupt But critics still que stioned

many questions that need to be answered President Bush said today that he had never discussed Enrons financial woe s with Mr Lay who has supported Mr Bush politically since his unsuccessf ul campaign

investigation of the companys collapse b ecause of his relationship with Enron Common Cause reported today that a c anvass of federal election records showed that Mr Ashcroft had received a total of from the company and Mr Lay for his Senate campaign Enron which pioneered deregulation of the nations power business and grew to be one of the worlds largest energy companies before its sudden fall has long nurtured close ties to Mr Bush But in the Oval Office today the president went to some length to distance himself from Mr Lay who he sai d had been a supporter of Governor Ann Richards of Texas when Mr Bush defe ated her in And she named him the head of the Governors Business Council Mr Bush said And I decided to leave him in place just for the sake of continui ty And thats when I first got to know Ken and worked with Ken Mr Bush said that he had never discussed the financial problems of Enron w ith Mr Lay and that he had last seen him in the spring at a fundraising event in Houston Mr Fleischer said Mr Bush had not talked to Mr Lay sin ce the spring It was Mr Fleischer who first told reporters this morning almost as an af terthought at a sparsely attended early news briefing that Mr Lay had cal led both Mr ONeill and Mr Evans last fall to alert them about the compan ys financial straits Officials at the Treasury and Commerce Departments said Mr Lay had spoken to Mr ONeill about Enrons condition on Oct and Nov and had spoken to Mr Evans on Oct Although Mr Lay had maintained until late Octobe r an optimistic public face about Enrons future on Oct the company re ported a thirdquarter net loss of million On the same day Moodys I nvestors Service announced that Enrons longterm debt obligations were on review The dates of the calls and the announcements of the bad financial news abou t the company are significant If Mr Lay had made the calls earlier in Oct ober before the state of the company was widely known the Bush administra tion would have been aware of the true condition of Enron while Mr Lay was promoting a different story on Wall Street In an interview on CNBC tonight Mr ONeill said Mr Lay had not asked for a government bailout or other intervention to save the company He called me to advise me that Enrons problems were mounting and to offe r access for our technical people to talk with his technical people about t he contracts that they had that were causing them problems Mr ONeill s aid I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak wit h the Enron people which he did so that we could satisfy ourselves that t he Enron affairs were not going to have a negative impact on US capital m arkets Asked whether Mr Lay asked for government assistance Mr ONeill said A bsolutely not On the same CNBC program Mr Evans said Mr Lay had told him that Moodys Investors Service was likely downgrade its rating of the companys debt Mr Lay then said that if there was anything Mr Evans could do to help the company deal with Moodys we would welcome that But Mr Evans added Mr Lay did not ask him specifically to intervene with Moodys I listened to him and listened to their condition and listened to the iss ues he wanted to raise Mr Evans said Subsequent to that I talked to Secretary ONeill and told him I had the call It was a pretty easy decisio n to make I dont think there was anything for us to do Secretary ONeill agreed with me there was not so we didnt do anything A Commerce Department official said today that in Mr Lays call with Mr E vans there was no information discussed that wasnt already in the publi c domain Mr Fleischer said that Mr Bush was first told this morning in the Oval Of fice by Mr ONeill and Mr Evans that Mr Lay had made the calls to them a nd that they had not been willing to intervene to help The president then told Mr ONeill and Mr Evans according to Mr Fleischers account You did the right thing Mr Fleischer said the president expressed no surprise regret or annoyance that he had not been informed of the calls from Mr Lay until more than tw o months after they occurred Bankruptcies happen in our economy Mr Fleischer said And its not uncommon for people who are in the community business community or in the labor community to talk to a cabinet secretary to tell them about the fina ncial status of their business and it ends there Democrats on Capitol Hill moved immediately to question the White House sta tements It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was lik ely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and sh areholders who ultimately lost their life savings said Representative He nry A Waxman the California Democrat who is his partys senior member on the House Government Reform Committee Mr Fleischer said that he hoped that any Congressional inquiry would be ev enhanded and that if it became a oneparty witch hunt I think the Congr ess is going again to remind the country on why people soured and tired of those types of partisan investigations Mr Lay and Enron executives have given more than to Mr Bushs va rious campaigns and Mr Lay also gave to Mr Bushs inaugural com mittee But Mr Lay does not appear to have been a frequent recent visitor to the W hite House based on publicly available records He visited the White House only twice during the first five months of Mr Bushs presidency accordin g to Secret Service access control records obtained by The New York Times u nder the Freedom of Information Act The first visit occurred on Feb the day Enron officials met with the staff of Vice President Dick Chen eys energy task force The second visit the records show was on April the day Mr Lay and ot her Enron officials met with Mr Cheney for about a halfhour Enron offici als freely discussed the meeting last year with reporters providing a copy of the memorandum on electricity issues the company presented to Mr Chene y One month later Mr Cheneys energy policy task force issued its final rep ort In the section on deregulation of the electricity markets the report s recommendations resembled much of what Enron had advocated They also tra cked with policies advocated by Mr Bush during the presidential

Key Question For Accountants in Wake Of the Clien ts Collapse ExSenator Hired for Review By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Jonathan Weil John Emshwiller and S cot J Paltrow The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The storm cloud hanging over Enron Corp and its longtime outside auditor Arthur Andersen LLP just got darker In the latest revelation in the collapse of Enron Arthur Andersen disclose d to federal agencies investigating the energy trading firm that individual s at the accounting firm in recent months disposed of a significant but un determined number of documents related to its work for Enron The terse announcement left many questions unanswered Who disposed of the documents and how Why Did it happen after investigations began In any event the disclosure appeared likely to further damage the already tarnished reputation of the nations fifthlargest accounting firm The Sec urities and Exchange Commission which is investigating Enron said destruc tion of documents is an extremely serious matter Andersen officials were called late last year to testify to a congressional committee about why the firm failed to detect the financial woes that cont ributed to Enrons downfall The Justice Department said this week that it had formed a task force to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron A depa rtment spokesman wouldnt say whether the agency knew of document destructi on or whether Andersen was a target of criminal investigation Andersens disclosure will increase pressure on the firm to fully disclose its handling of the Enron account Dec congressional testimony by Josep h F Berardino Andersens managing partner and chief executive officer ma y have mischaracterized part of one Enron deal and understated Andersens k nowledge about it people familiar with the matter say Andersen says the t estimony was truthful but based on incomplete information White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said yesterday he had no knowledge that the Bush administration got advance word from Andersen of the document des truction But President Bush called for a government review of the Enron ca se amid disclosure that Enron chief Kenneth Lay lobbied two cabinet secret aries for help as the company was nearing bankruptcy court Mr Lay also co ntacted Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan around the same time a Fed spokesman confirmed Yesterday Attorney General John Ashcroft said he had recused himself from the Justice Departments investigation of Enron citing a conflict of inter est In addition the Justice Department said much of the US attorneys o ffice in Houston would be recused because of family ties In Houston an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on Andersens document disposal other than to say that the accounting firms announcement was th e first Enron had heard about it The spokeswoman added We are not aware of the shredding of any documents that are part of any inquiry investigati on or litigation matter For Andersen the Enron mess could hardly come at a worse time In recent y ears the firm has approved the financial statements of a series of its hig hprofile corporate clients including Sunbeam Corp and Waste Management I nc that later proved to be false Andersen paid tens of millions of dolla rs in damages to each companys shareholders without admitting wrongdoing in either case The deepening investigation into Enron could make it harder for Andersen to attract new clients and seems sure to distract top executi ves for a time Andersen said it asked former Sen John Danforth a Missouri Republican t o conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersens records manag ement policy and to advise the firm to ensure that all appropriate remedi al and disciplinary actions have been taken While Andersen has defended its audits of Enron critics say the firm faile d to identify a number of questionable accounting practices by Enron that c ontributed to its abrupt downfall Once the dominant player in energy tradi ng the Houston company had to file for bankruptcycourt protection after a series of disclosures Enron had transactions with certain partnerships that were run by its own o fficers including its chief financial officer at the time Andrew Fastow but that were treated by Enron as separate It offered only murky and f ragmented information about the partnerships One of them whose existence Enron didnt disclose for four years was part of an arrangement that infla ted earnings by several hundred million dollars And Enrons debt level was much higher than it revealed thanks to the part nerships which allowed Enron to keep some debt off its books In November a restatement by Enron of its financial results which Andersen had appr oved as accurate resulted in lowering Enrons reported earnings for the prior four years by million or Enron said its previous financial statements for those years could no longer be relied upon Among issues investigators now will doubtless probe is how many and which E nronrelated documents were destroyed and who destroyed them Andersen sai d individuals had disposed of a significant but undetermined number of e lectronic and paper documents and correspondence It added Millions of d ocuments related to Enron still exist and the firm has successfully retrie ved some of the deleted electronic files The firm is continuing retrieval efforts through electronic backup files and is continuing in its efforts t o fully learn and understand all the facts related to this issue Another issue will be when the documents were destroyed The firm said it h ad a policy now suspended that required in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents Many big corporations have sim ilar policies specifying how long employees must retain certain categories of records Under prevailing regulations auditors are required to adopt reasonable pr ocedures for safe custody of their working papers and should keep them for long enough to satisfy any pertinent legal requirements of records retent ion People with knowledge of the Justice Departments Enron probe said An dersen didnt destroy any audit working papers The destruction of documents would be especially troubling to investigators and regulators if some of it occurred after they had begun their inquiries into Enrons downfall That would raise the question of whether the action was designed to thwart investigators Andersen said it had confirmed that certain Enronrelated documents were destroyed during the months before t he SEC issued a subpoena to Andersen It said it hadnt determined whether any were destroyed after the subpoena but said it had told personnel after the subpoena arrived to preserve Enronrelated documents Andersens revelation about document disposal could raise embarrassing ques tions for Deloitte Touche LLP which this month released results of a pe er review of Andersens system of accounting and auditing quality The rev iew which focused on the firms practices generally and not on its handl ing of Enron concluded that Andersens system of accounting and auditing quality provided reasonable assurance of compliance with professional sta ndards A Deloitte official said that the firms peer review of Andersen included a n evaluation of the firms Houston office which handled Enrons audits bu t that Deloitte wasnt permitted to include Andersens audit work for Enron because of pending litigation Neither Deloitte nor Andersen would comment on whether the review would be reopened The unfolding Enron saga could have a detrimental effect overall on Anderse n which employs people in countries and last year had US reven ue of billion As with all accounting firms Andersens ability to att ract and retain audit clients depends on having a sterling reputation The more its reputation comes into question the more likely it becomes that in vestors will view an audit opinion by Andersen with skepticism prompting s ome clients to switch to other auditors There is no evidence that has happened so far Asked whether Andersen has b een told by any clients that they are switching to other auditors spokesma n David Tabolt said Some have been concerned Some have been supportive I just dont think that we know yet how people are going to react but we c ertainly hope that people will be understanding More than a dozen compani es that use Andersen as their auditor declined to comment on whether they m ight review their relationship Andersen also has taken heat over its audit of the

contributions to members of Congress only an exacting and unflinchin g set of investigations can assure the country that Enron executives are no t receiving special treatment from the government So far the White House is taking the right steps We trust its determination will not flag in the months ahead even if embarrassing questions come up about Enrons ties to the administration The Justice Department decision to create a special task force to determine whether to bring criminal charges against Enron or its officers appears to be a recognition of both the complexity and the importance of this case S uch task forces based in Washington but involving prosecutors around the c ountry are usually reserved for potential crimes of national import and t his is certainly that Thousands of unsuspecting Enron employees lost much of their retirement savings while company officials enriched themselves by dumping their stock before the plight of the company became known Placing the

fecting company pension plans and financial disclosures with an eye toward averting any future Enronlike debacles Mr Bush however must do more to show that he understands the full import of the Enron

earlier this week that Mr Cheney or members of his task force had met with Enron officials six times But so far Mr Che ney has not offered detailed information about the agenda of each meeting He must now do so in recognition that this is no longer about whether to s uccumb to the pestering of partisan Democrats on Capitol Hill It is about reassuring millions of American investors whose confidence

Section C ENRONS COLLAPSE THE PENSIONS Bush Promises a Look at Employee Risks but Experts Say Solutions Wont Be Easy By DANIEL ALTMAN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Reacting to the destruction of the retirement savings of thousands of emplo yees of the Enron Corporation President Bush said yesterday that the admin istration would start looking at ways to make sure that people are not ex posed to losing their life savings as a result of a bankruptcy But without changes in law and corporate behavior the White House may have a hard time reaching that goal Many Enron employees lost their retirement savings because the savings were tied up almost exclusively in company securities Over half the funds in E nrons k plans for employees were invested in Enrons own shares That situation is by no means unique said J Mark Iwry a former benefits tax counsel at the Treasury Department Survey data suggest that more than percent of assets are invested in company stock at those companies that allow their stock to be included in their k plans And in companies li ke Enron where management has some influence over how employee savings are invested slightly over half the assets on average are in company stock Why given the seemingly obvious benefits of diversification would workers still end up putting so many nest eggs in the same basket By law companies must offer several options for k plans But unlike t raditional pension plans which cannot put more than percent of their as sets in any one company the rules governing k plans do not set limits And many companies give their employees big incentives to buy shares with their k contributions Companies often match employee contributions o nly with stock and impose limits on how soon the shares can be sold Secretary of the Treasury Paul H ONeill said yesterday that he would cons ider ways to give American workers more than million of whom have money in k plans more freedom to make investment decisions But Brigitte Madrian a professor of economics at the University of Chicago said holders of k plans generally show little initiative Most peopl e stick with the default k plan set up by their company even if that plan invests solely in the companys shares And employees are unlikely to keep close tabs on their retirement savings despite the possibility of a s udden collapse like Enrons Most people arent in the habit of tracking their k investments on a daily basis she said The reasons employees buy their own companies shares may go beyond company rules People may simply be more confident in their employers than in the rest of the market James Delaplane vice president for retirement policy a t the American Benefits Council said that even though Enron employees had opportunities at certain times to diversify their savings many still chose to invest heavily in the companys stock because of their loyalty to Enron and its past success Sometimes colleagues confidence is enough Some employees felt social p ressures to put even their own money into company stock Ms Madrian said Those workers she said suffered the most when Enrons value crumbled Legislation has intensified such trends according to Mr Iwry He cited ta x deductions on dividend payments for shares bought through employee stock ownership plans Such plans can also offer shares at a discount Mr Iwry warned that measures taken to encourage diversification by employe es might discourage companies from making matching contributions A bill ha s already been introduced in the House that would limit the portion of a k plan that may be held in a companys own shares to percent Legislative changes and regulatory changes can improve things said Eri c Lofgren director of the benefits group at Watson Wyatt a consulting fir m but they have to be really careful It is possible for them to do more harm than good Mr Lofgren said education could encourage diversification The risk of l ack of diversification he said is certainly something you want to com municate to anyone who has the option of going into one stock Mr Delaplane said he also preferred educational steps by companies over le gislation He said some of the damage from Enrons collapse might have been avoided if its employees had received personal financial advice from indep endent consultants But such advice might not have taken account of the fact that Enron for wh at it says were administrative reasons did not allow employees to sell the ir stock in the k plan for a critical period when the stock price was falling Top executives by contrast did not face the same restrictions on the shares they owned outside the k plan and those they had acquired through stock options Though k plans may receive the bulk of the attention in the Enron case at least one authority on retirement saving hopes that Mr Bush will cons ider the issue more broadly The biggest need is to try to expand the cov erage of the pension system said James Poterba an MIT economics prof essor That typically means trying to find ways to get smaller firms and lowerwage firms to adopt more systematic retirement arrangements Mr Bush also promised to focus attention more broadly on disclosure of fin ancial information And Edmund L Jenkins chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board said It is important that we have transparency of information for inve stors Its a natural reaction to a situation such as Enrons for questions to be asked in this area But until we know what happened Mr Jenkins added its hard to know what to address

New York Times Company Lawyers for the Enron Corporation negotiated late into the night yesterday as they tried to extract the best deal from companies interested in buying its oncemighty energy trading business Several lawyers for companies monitoring the auction held as part of Enron s bankruptcy proceedings at the Midtown Manhattan offices of the law firm of Weil Gotshal Manges said that at various points in the evening diff erent bidders seemed to be ahead but that the negotiations were too close to call Citibank and UBS both submitted bids this week BP was bidding for some por tions

financial officer said in a statement relea sed late last night to placate reporters We hope to have a conclusion an d announcement Friday morning Enrons flagship energy trading business bought and sold energyrelated com modities like gas and electricity as well as more complex financial product s to hedge against energy market risk Included in the businesses for sale was its Internet trading operation EnronOnline Since Enron filed for bank ruptcy on Dec the trading business has honored outstanding contracts bu t has not originated new transactions according to its lawyers Any deal for the trading operations would not be final Today a federal ba nkruptcy judge is scheduled to approve the transaction but several credito rs have objected to different aspects of the sale in recent weeks Lawyers for Enron said that if the hearing needs to be postponed it will be It is unclear how much of a competitor the new trading business will be Fo r one thing analysts and industry experts said that the trading business to be operated by a joint venture with a new investor would probably be mo re cautious than Enron was Enrons operations will probably be more conservatively run within the ne w structure with another major investor being a major shareholder said Gordon A Howald an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais The culture at a fi nancial institution like Citibank or UBS is different from that at Enron w hich at its heyday had a reputation for tolerating very high levels of risk he said Enron for example was involved in a significant number of commodities t hat were not necessarily very liquid coal metals he said By serving as a marketmaker Enron risked having to make good on a deal that another company failed to complete at great potential cost Any buyers Mr Howald said would have to seriously consider whether the y would want to take on that added risk Bidders have not necessarily proposed paying cash for Enrons trading opera tion said Martin J Bienenstock a lawyer at Weil Gotshal which represent s Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings Rather the buyer would provide nece ssary financial backing and take an ownership stake in a joint venture that would own the trading business which includes more than employees and the software computers and necessary facilities Over all energy trading appears to have become more conservative since Enr ons collapse Traders are scrutinizing the financial health of their tradi ng partners much more closely said one executive involved in risk manageme nt at a major energy company that operates its own trading business The executive who insisted that his name not be used in an article discuss ing Enron said that some traders now require more collateral or have tri ggers in contracts requiring other parties to provide more collateral un der certain circumstances The whole industry is running itself differently said Paul Patterson an analyst who covers the energy industry for ABN Amro in New York But the changes in trading practices did not cause Enrons demise he added Wha t you really had was a run on the bank he said The new trading business for now known only by its acronym Netco for New Energy Trading Company will therefore not instantly become an energy tradi ng powerhouse It will have to regain the confidence of other energy trader s Mr Howald the analyst said that recovery would not come quickly Its going to take a long time to get anywhere close to the volume they traded i n the past he said Newscast Latest developments in the Enron collapse just seem to be getting curiouser and

Leave Banker in an Awkward Spot By RIVA D ATLAS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Enrons collapse leaves Marc Shapiro of J P Morgan Chase in a difficult p osition As a vice chairman who oversees finance and risk management at the bank Mr Shapiro has had to repeatedly explain how the venerable New York institut ion came to have so much at stake At last tally the bank provided bi llion to Enron the giant energy trading company that fell into bankruptcy last month The relationship went beyond traditional loans to a variety of complicated financings including futures contracts involving offshore comp anies and debt backed by Enrons receivables Disclosures about the extent of that exposure have left J P Morgans inve stors wondering if top management was fully aware of its Enron position bef ore the companys demise Even now questions persist about whether there a re more surprises to come for J P Morgans investors Not only does Mr Shapiro have to answer for the financial decisions but h e has to navigate a web of ties to Enron A native of Houston Enrons home town and a former chief executive of Texas Commerce Mr Shapiro has long moved in circles with Kenneth L Lay Enrons chief executive Mr Lay was once a member of the board of Texas Commerce a bank that was acquired by a predecessor of J P Morgan in Mr Lay has had a long professional relationship with Marc Shapiro and co nsiders him a very good friend said Mark Palmer an Enron spokesman A relationship with Enron was until recently quite prized on Wall Street Mr Shapiro said in a conference call with analysts last month It is di fficult to remember that four to five months ago Enron was a very solid in vestmentgrade company with a very positive reputation he said We and lots of other people had that belief Even though billion would be a manageable loss for Morgan Mr Shapiro may have more at stake personally He was in the running for the top job at Morgan which went to William B Harrison Jr The Enron debacle as political pressures mount and criminal inquiries commence could p rove to be an embarrassing coda on a highly successful career J P Morgan and the banks it acquired have led more than a third of Enron s bank financings since according to estimates by the Loan Pricing Co rporation a New York research firm Citigroup led an estimated percent of Enrons loans The lending relationship probably helped J P Morgan gai n other Enron business including the role of merger adviser on the company s illfated plan to be acquired by Dynegy Recent lawsuits disclose that the bank engaged in some complicated financin gs on Enrons behalf On Dec J P Morgan filed a lawsuit demanding that Enron turn over billion in assets tied to a financing that was backed by Enron receivable s J P Morgan has said that it is owed less than million of this tot al because it arranged the loan and then sold the rest to other investors A week later the bank surprised investors by disclosing that it was owed n early billion from a group of insurance companies that had backed commod ity contracts between J P Morgan and Enron The insurers have refused to pay After it filed suit against the insurers in late December J P Morgan sai d that its exposure to Enron totaled billion That was billion gr eater than implied in a press release in November as Enrons financial dif ficulties became apparent For many analysts it was not the size of the exposure but the sharp revis ion that unnerved them J P Morgan has lost some credibility in its ris kmanagement warning systems wrote David Hendler an analyst with Credit Sights a research firm that tracks the debt markets We are not confiden t that the latest disclosures will be the final ones The Enron situation is a rare embarrassment for Mr Shapiro who is well re garded by competitors and investors for his facility with numbers as well a s his frankness At just he became chief financial officer of Texas Com merce Mr Shapiro did not have direct responsibility for loans to Enron but appea rs to have taken an interest in the companys struggle for survival On at least a couple of occasions last fall he helped along rescue discussions within the bank and with Dynegy executives according to executives at J P Morgan and at Dynegy According to a recent article in The New York Observer Mr Shapiro called a J P Morgan investment banker in November and asked him to help the comp any find a savior But according to officials at J P Morgan that request was made not at the urging of Mr Lay but of a Morgan banker in Houston wh o worked directly with Enron and who knew Mr Shapiro Mr Shapiro said such occasional involvement should not be surprising or s uspicious As a leading financial institution our executives have valuab le relationships with many business leaders he said But that doesnt mean theres any difficulty in doing the right thing for our firm You do w hat you need to do to protect the interests of the institution Mr Shapiro is probably taking a personal interest in the case said Debora h Fiorito who handles communications for Dynegy and who worked for Mr Sha piro at Texas Commerce Marcs interest in this transcends many levels she said He cares a lot about what happens to Houston You cant say en ough about the impact of this on the city Mr Lay served on the board of Texas Commerce because he was a major custom er of the bank and because he had stature among Houston business executives I respected Ken Lay very much said Ben Love the longtime chief execut ive of Texas Commerce who hired and mentored Mr Shapiro and asked Mr Lay to join the banks board I am dumbfounded like everyone else about Enr ons collapse he said Mr Shapiros ties to Mr Lay extended beyond the board of Texas Commerce The men were involved in Houston politics and civic affairs and they have served on a committee to help burnish the image of the University of Housto n However ugly and embarrassing the Enron debacle may be Mr Shapiro emphasi zed to analysts last month that it was unlikely to cripple the bank Of the billion in loans outstanding to Enron about a fourth million is unsecured Even if the bank loses all of the unsecured amount that repr esents less than percent of J P Morgans billion in corporate loan s derivatives obligations and commitments at the end of the third quarter The way the information came out was unusual but there was nothing sinis ter about it said Thomas K Brown who runs Second Curve Capital which invests in bank stocks They just bungled We all want neat answers but in the world we live in arrangements with large corporations are increasin gly complex Mr Brown who said he thought the world of Marc Shapiro suggested tha t Mr Shapiros reputation would weather the Enron debacle Bankruptcies of this size dont happen every day he said Photo Marc Shapiro who oversees finance and risk management at J P Morg an Chase has had to field many questions about Morgans

Jathon Sapsford Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Representatives of Enron Corp and its creditors were still negotiating yes terday evening in an effort to coax the highest possible offer for parts of the companys oncepowerful wholesale trading unit As of yesterday evening the company hadnt yet selected a winning bid from multiple

Enrons advisers and creditors consider it a priority to try to get the ene rgytrading business which still has a staff of about people up and running again Enrons advisers had been aiming to find a creditworthy par tner willing to take a stake in the trading unit which trades dozens o f products and once accounted for the bulk of Enrons revenues The details of the bids submitted by Citigroup and UBS havent been disclos ed BP has said it offered million for only the computer settlement support systems of the Enron unit but that it hadnt submitted a bid for control of the whole unit A BP spokesman reiterated yesterday however that if th e bidding process set up by the bankruptcy court doesnt work out we did express an interest in negotiating without commitment for other things The earliest Enron is expected to disclose a decision if it reaches one is at a hearing on the matter scheduled for New York federal bankruptcy court this morning It remained unclear yesterday evening whether a deal wo uld be cemented in time to present to the court Alternatively it is possi ble that Enron will ask the court for more time to negotiate or announce t hat it had found none of the offers acceptable one person involved in the process said The effort to sell a controlling stake in the unit could be further complic ated by the attempt by more than a dozen creditors to temporarily block the sale of the energytrading business Those creditors which include Royal Bank of Scotland and powertrading rivals have asked for guarantees that E nron will put the proceeds in an escrow

Page Column c New York Times Companyxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse government officials said yesterday At the same time the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations By consolidating the criminal investigations the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a whitecollar case involving a single company was virtually unheardof and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries The task force will bring together prosecutors from several United States attorneys offices including those in Houston New York City and San Francisco with all of them reporting through the departments criminal division officials said In addition prosecutors from the fraud section part of the criminal division will be part of the task force This is a case of national scope and national significance that is going to require coordination and manpower and the task force is a way of achieving that one official said Robert S Bennett a Washington lawyer who represents the company said last night that he saw the departments decision as positive Im pleased that there now appears to be some centralization and coordination because it is very difficult and expensive to deal with half a dozen different entities he said This is a company in bankruptcy and it needs to be given a fair shot to come out of bankruptcy and increase the value for stakeholders If we get caught in a cumbersome scandal machine that may not happen While the decision to form the task force is final many details have yet to be worked out officials said Some prosecutors involved in the case have not been notified of their specific roles in the task force and other decisions about where the group will work and how the various strands of investigation will be coordinated have not been determined The Justice Department has formed numerous task forces in the past but they have usually focused either on complex cases of violent crime or conducted inquiries into practices by entire industries Legal experts who have examined the Enron case said yesterday that by bringing together the disparate pieces of the sprawling criminal investigation of the company the government is overcoming hurdles that might have hampered the inquiry if it was conducted in separate offices For example while federal prosecutors in Manhattan have the most experience in investigating complex whitecollar cases they might face difficulty in meeting the requirement that potential crimes took place in their geographical jurisdiction And while prosecutors in Houston where Enron is based would have no such problems they do not have the same experience in whitecollar cases By bringing the prosecutors together while simultaneously adding the manpower from the departments fraud section legal experts said the government is raising the probability of indictments Prosecutors tend to indict what they investigate said John C Coffee Jr a law professor at Columbia University who has testified in Congress on the Enron case This kind of task force for an individual investigation is without precedent and while it doesnt guarantee an indictment it certainly raises the stakes But some past efforts by the Justice Department to take a more central role in a criminal investigation of a corporation with influence in Washington have raised concerns about potential political influence over the inquiry For example in the s when part of an inquiry involving the Archer Daniels Midland Company was assigned to the fraud section some critics contended to the vehement denials of Justice officials that Washington was trying to protect Archer the politically influential grain company Enron whose officers have been close to both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney has exercised similar political influence in the past In addition to the inquiry being conducted by the Justice Department Enrons collapse is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and several Congressional committees Meanwhile in Enrons bankruptcy proceedings parts of the company are now up for auction to the highest bidder For example an auction of its trading business is scheduled to take place today and a spokeswoman said it should be presented to the bankruptcy court at a hearing tomorrow But a speedy approval by the court is not assured Several creditors have filed objections to the auction because they are worried that they will not have time to evaluate whether all or parts of the business will be sold at a fair price Creditors have also expressed concern about what would happen to the proceeds from the sale Creditors of Enron North America the unit that owns the trading business want to make sure that the money goes to them and is not distributed among all the companys creditors In Houston yesterday in a suit filed by investors against Enron directors and officers a federal judge dealt a setback to plaintiffs by declining to freeze more than billion that they say the directors and officers gained from the sale of Enron shares while hiding information about the companys decline However the judge also told defendants that she had the power to freeze the assets if necessary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved US Puts Task Force on Criminal Probe of Enron By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud The investigation will be run by the departments criminal division coordinating among US Attorneys in New York City San Francisco Houston and elsewhere The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation in early December Enron the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas filed for bankruptcycourt protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors The problems have resulted largely from Enrons dealings with private partnerships run by some of its own executives The company saw its market value plunge recently to about million from more than billion last year The Securities and Exchange Commission which has been investigating Enron since October and the Justice Department could both file cases alleging violations of securities laws if Enron is found to have intentionally misled investors about its financial condition Several Congressional committees also have begun inquiries into various aspects of Enrons collapse Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department It has been the posture of the company to fully cooperate with government investigations said Robert Bennett an attorney with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom which represents the company At the end of day Im pretty optimistic an objective person will see that many of the things said and written about Enron arent true Confirmation of the probe came even as nearly two dozen firms asked a US bankruptcycourt judge to temporarily block Enrons intended sale of its energytrading business until recently the earnings juggernaut for the entire company The court approved an auction process on Dec that was to have resulted in the announcement of the winning bidder as early as tomorrow Bidders for pieces of Enrons energytrading business which still has a staff of about people include Citigroup Inc UBS AG and BP PLC people familiar with the matter have said But a host of creditors have asked the court to delay the sale indefinitely The list includes financial institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and GE Capital Corp as well as powertrading rivals such as Mirant Corp El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Aquila Inc a unit of Utilicorp United Inc Aquila said it doesnt oppose the sale per se but wants guarantees that Enron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has been made about how it will be split among creditors Mirant Atlanta in its pleadings with the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York said the sales materials circulated by Enron lacked significant material information that is essential to make an informed decision regarding the wisdom of the transaction The materials lack a minimum bid which begs the question Mirant said as to whether there is a bid that is simply too low to accept or whether the debtors are preparing to sell at any price Challengers also questioned who would be responsible for liabilities excluded from the sale Enrons energymarketing unit which includes its oncemighty EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform traded dozens of products until recently and generated roughly of the firms earnings in the most recent quarter It also was responsible for the bulk of Enrons revenue of billion In bankruptcycourt documents filed in December Enron said the companys wholesaletrading business of which the energytrading unit is a major part had assets of about billion and liabilities of at least billion Concerns over Enrons financial strength and the integrity of its accounting practices caused trading partners to back away from doing business with it starting in midOctober From that point on a significant portion of Enrons trading volume came from customers trying to wind down their Enronrelated positions The unit ceased meaningful operations prior to Enrons Dec bankruptcycourt filing Resuscitation will require a cash infusion from a trusted partner with a bluechip credit rating the company has said It has proposed transferring assets to a new venture in which Enron would retain a position The new investor would control the partnership that has been dubbed New Energy Trading Company LP An Enron spokesman said the firm would press to go ahead with the proposal Its in the best interest of Enron and its creditors to get the trading operation started as soon as possible to get as much value for the estate as possible said spokesman Mark Palmer Kathy Chu of Dow Jones Newswires contributed

light to the facts We want to get to the bottom of this too said Robert Bennett a Washington attorney representing the Houstonbased company A lot of decent and honorable people work at Enron and we

worlds top buyer and seller of natural gas and the largest electricity marketer in the United States It also marketed coal pulp paper plastics metals and fiberoptic bandwidth One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enrons heavy reliance on offbalancesheet partnerships which took on Enron debt The partnerships masked Enrons financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business The Houstonbased company went bankrupt after its credit collapsed and its main rival Dynegy

just before the investing public realized the company was heading for disaster The vice presidents office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide was Oct just six days before the first in a

said Wednesday she has the authority to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that Enron Corp insiders earned through selling their stock but declined to do so US District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal cited a Supreme Court opinion for her authority to freeze the assets of the Enron executives and board members named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a number of worker retirement funds But she ruled there were insufficient grounds for issuing such an order based on the evidence and arguments she has heard so far In her ruling Rosenthal wrote she would not order the restraining order on the assets without allegations or evidence that each or any defendant has or is likely to conceal the stock sales proceeds or profits or place them beyond reach absent immediate judicial intervention Enron officials were not immediately available for comment The lawsuit filed by New Yorkbased Amalgamated Bank in November alleges that Enron executives and board members sold billion in Enron stock over the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued Amalgamated Bank manages pension funds that hold Enron stock The lawsuit claims the company officials were aware of accounting problems that led to inflated earnings reports and higher stock prices In November Enron reported it was adjusting its earnings for the past years because of bookkeeping errors related to investment partnerships it had formed That included a million reduction in net income adding billion in debt to its books and a cent reduction in earnings per share We are gratified that we have cleared this important legal hurdle said Amalgamateds attorney Bill Lerach in a statement Wednesday We are also pleased that the court has held open the possibility that we may conduct discovery to obtain additional evidence to justify the requested injunction In a Dec hearing Lerach asked the judge to freeze the assets of the Enron insiders including Chairman and CEO Ken Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling claiming there was a danger they would flee the country with the profits from exercising their stock options Lay netted million in stock sales for the first nine months of according to data compiled by Thomson FinancialFirst Call while Skilling collected million Attorneys representing Enron denied that their clients would do so and challenged the courts authority to freeze assets In her ruling this week Rosenthal ordered Amalgamated to file a brief in support of its request for expedited discovery into the case by Jan and for Enron and its executives to file a response by Feb VIEWPOINTS White House Was a Home For Enron Robert Reno Newsday ALL EDITIONS A Copyright Newsday Inc PRESIDENT George W Bush says hes had no contact with Enron officials in the last six weeks Thats a relief It shows he has sense enough to know when a corporation has turned radioactive and is best approached at the end of a foot pole Still this leaves almost an entire year in which Enron officials waltzed in and out of the White House enjoying an unusual degree of access The Washington Post reports that Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides found time to meet with Enron officials on six occasions in On the face of it this may not even seem excessive for an administration in which corporate interests have been given an extraordinary degree of influence And besides David S Addington the vice presidents counsel wrote a letter insisting that Enron did not communicate information about its financial position in any of the meetings with the vice president or with

permit it to avoid one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in history It was probably just seeking to influence some government action that would advance the general interests of Enron perhaps relief

administration what more logical place to come than the White House Rep Henry Waxman DCalif can be forgiven his cynicism about these Enron meetings He said It shows Enron far exceeded the access provided by the White House to other parties interested in energy policy Certainly it exceeds the access that would be granted to say a bunch of highminded old ladies in handknitted sweaters pleading against a rape of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Anyway White House officials said the Enron meetings reflected nothing more sinister than the open and inclusive policy of the vice presidents energy task force They made it sound like all the meetings had taken place in plain sight on the White lawn Anyway the Enron meetings continued until just days before the company started to collapse Cheneys aides met with executives of Enrons German subsidiary on Aug and with Enron officials on Oct Six days later Enrons troubles became news and the shell of its assets became transparent to the world A little more than a month later Enron announced million in bonuses to key employees Another employees got pink slips and in severance pay to console them for k balances that had become close to worthless because the bulk of it was in Enron shares This gave off an odor of favoritism until it was explained that somebody had to be induced to stay around and pick over the bones of Enrons carcass

Creditors of Enron Corp have shifted into high gear in anticipation of an expected intense day of haggling Thursday when the bankrupt energy company auctions off its trading operations So far two financial bidders Citicorp Inc and UBS Warburg have submitted bids for the Houstonbased companys biggest business sources said But both Enron and creditors are hoping other companies may jump into the fray for all or parts of Enrons electricity and gas trading operations To take part a bidder needs only to submit a sealed bid and a certified check for million to be returned if the bid is not chosen British oil giant BP Plc for instance said it is interested in a small part but not all of Enrons trading operations but left the door open to enlarge its bid later The auction is set to take place at am at the New York office of Enrons attorneys Weil Gotshal Manges Enron lawyers will evaluate bids with a member unsecured creditors committee and could present its recommendations to US Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzales Friday Enron once the worlds biggest energy trading company is seeking a wellheeled backer to take a controlling stake in the Enron trading operations and guarantee contracts The company which filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection Dec is aiming to revive the moribund trading operations to generate cash to pay off creditors It is hoping eventually to emerge from the debt shield under Chapter a prospect that can take months or years Thursdays auction is likely to be a drawnout affair where negotiators will likely pressure bidders to sweeten offers by playing them off against each other This is not like Sothebys said one member of Enrons unsecured creditors committee a panel chosen by a US Bankruptcy Court trustee to represent the interests of banks bondholders and other stakeholders in Enron It could go on all day and conceivably into the night This committee member who asked for anonymity said Enron lawyers and the committee could agree on a bidder or ask for more time Or they could decide Enron is better off keeping the business A key point of discussions this week was the distribution of the proceeds of cash flow from a revival of Enrons trading operation which generated the bulk of Enrons billion in revenue in wholesale services by far its largest division people familiar with the discussions said But these people denied news reports that characterized the discussions as a dispute with Enron and said any issues are likely to be resolved in a way that will not hold up the auction This is a very extreme and inaccurate statement of fact to suggest there is a dispute said one creditor representative We are undertaking due diligence to support the right action That is what we are supposed to be doing as a creditors committee Another committee member said creditors have asked for more information on the nature and extent of the bids on the table But this member said there is a general agreement to resolve the issues as soon as possible I dont think we have enough information now as to whether we should endorse this sale said this member But he said there is agreement to expedite the sale in the hopes of reviving Enrons most valuable operation The longer you wait the staler the trading operation becomes he said This member said there have been objections filed in the US bankruptcy court to the sale of the trading operations But those objections were filed before any bids came in He said it seemed questionable to object to a sale that may benefit the bankrupt companys estate without knowing the offer Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved USA UPDATE GAO to decide within month on White House suit By Susan Cornwell Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON Jan Reuters The head of the US Congress investigative arm said on Wednesday he would decide within a month whether to sue the White House over its refusal to name industry executives the administration met with last year while drafting its new energy policy Comptroller General David Walker had been heading for a court clash with the administration last year but postponed a decision after the Sept hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon Now any decision by him to sue would add to Capitol Hills scrutiny of the collapsed energy giant Enron whose executives the White House has acknowledged consulting while drawing up its energy plan Citing the right of Congress to oversee the executive branch Walker head of the General Accounting Office began trying last May to get details of the workings of the administration task force that drew up the energy program Environmental groups say they were mostly shut out of the sessions of the task force which was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney They suspect private sector experts such as Enron heavily influenced the Bush energy plan Enron was a major backer of Bushs election campaign Bush himself is a former oil man and Cheney was formerly head of Halliburton Co the worlds No oilfield services company The policy announced by Bush in May urged more oil and gas drilling and a revived nuclear power program But the White House says it consulted widely in its energy policy review And the White House largely rebuffed the GAOs efforts to get the information about the National Energy Policy Development Group NEPDG as the task force was called I expect to make a decision on whether to file suit regarding GAOs access to NEPDG records within a month Walker said in a brief statement on Wednesday Walker began his probe of the energy task force after Rep Henry Waxman and Rep John Dingell both Democrats asked him to investigate ENRON DRAWS SCRUTINY Recently the energy task force controversy had seemed to all but evaporate Then last month Waxman seized on the spectacular collapse of Enron to write to Cheneys office again and ask what contacts the task force had with Enron The White House said in a letter released on Tuesday that Cheney or the energy task force staff met six times with Enron representatives last year Walkers spokesman Jeff Nelligan refused to be say whether the White Houses revelations about Enron or the five congressional committees probing Enron made a GAO lawsuit over the energy task force more or less likely In any case Waxman is seeking more information from the White House about its Enron contacts White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday the vice presidents office was reviewing the new request from Waxman Im not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enrons financial situation Fleischer added Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Editorial Desk Section A Joined at the Hip By BOB HERBERT The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Youll have to look long and extremely hard to come up with an example of corporate treachery in the United States thats as horrible as the Enron debacle This is a scandal with a very broad reach and it has some of the wise guys in the Bush administration and other top Republicans trembling in their penny loafers Enron was a bonanza for whom else the folks at the top of the pyramid They ferociously exploited their giltedged political connections and harvested breathtaking amounts of cash for themselves even as the company was collapsing into the biggest bankruptcy mess in US history Left behind were thousands of ordinary working men and women people with families and obligations who lost jobs life savings pensions the works And more carnage is to come The fallout is nationwide A week before Christmas Senator Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat spoke about the gloom that had settled over workers in his state who watched their retirement funds vanish Because of what happened at Enron he said there are Oregon families going to grief counseling rather than holiday parties this year No one knows yet the extent of the illegality if any that went on at Enron The Justice Department announced yesterday that it was launching a criminal investigation But there is no doubt that many of the companys top officials swam as a matter of course in an ethical sewer They were pals with and lavishly greased the palms of powerful people who were willing to guide government policy toward Enrons ends and who could help the company escape close scrutiny of its more sinister activities The Center for Public Integrity a nonpartisan watchdog agency in Washington examined the political contributions of top Enron executives and directors named in a shareholder lawsuit filed against the company last month Twentyfour of the made contributions from to totaling nearly to George W Bush members of Congress the two national political parties with the bulk of the contributions going to the Republicans and a variety of officials who are now responsible for investigating possible securities fraud by Enron Of the five who did not make contributions two were foreign nationals prohibited by law from contributing to candidates or parties The folks at the top of the company gave lavishly said Charles Lewis the centers executive director It just shows that this is a company inordinately dependent on government favors And how did these generous Enron officials behave as the apocalypse approached The shareholders suit as the center noted in its study alleges that the executives and directors dumped billion worth of stock while knowing the company was in danger of collapse Defendants in the lawsuit have disputed the charges against them But there is no disputing that as Enron toppled and fell insiders unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock while rankandfile Enron employees were locked into rules that left many of them helpless as the stocks value plunged from more than a share to less than It has long been known that Enron and its chairman Kenneth Lay were close to President Bush In Mr Lewiss book The Buying of the President Enron was already listed as Mr Bushs No career patron This week the office of Vice President Dick Cheney reluctantly disclosed that Enron executives met with Mr Cheney or his aides at least six times as the Bush administration with Mr Cheney in charge was putting together its national energy policy It will be interesting to find out as this scandal continues to unfold how aggressively the Justice Department the Securities and Exchange Commission and other appropriate agencies investigate a company that has been as generous and as wired and as powerfully influential as Enron Theres already talk that Harvey Pitt the chairman of the SEC may have to recuse himself because as a lawyer in private practice he did work for Arthur Andersen the company that audited Enrons books with its eyes closed Enron

Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company So now we know why the White House has spent the better part of a year fending off congressional efforts to find out who Vice President Dick Cheney met with for input on his energy task force Turns out that the vice president and his staff had at least six meetings with representatives from Enronincluding one with Chairman Kenneth L Laythe last of which occurred just six days before the company revealed that it had vastly overstated its earnings signaling the beginning of the end for the energy giant Since the Enron collapse President Bush has been acting like Lay was just some good ol boy who also happened to hail from Texas This new information proves otherwise that Lay and his companys sizable political contributions had bought what Rep Henry Waxman DLos Angeles has termed extensive access to the epicenter of American political power Its Teapot Dome the Sequel During his run for the White House Bush fought long and hard to convince us that he was a new breed of conservativea Compassionate Conservative But recent events make clear that he is actually the standardbearer of a far more coldhearted breed Call them the Enron Conservatives Enron Conservatives are people who use political money and connections as levers to free themselves of all accountability to laws regulations and responsibilityeven to their own employees Simply put they are people who consistently shamelessly and aggressively put their selfinterest above the public interest And when the lives of others are destroyed in the process they just look the other way and hope that the law does too And all too often it does It probably is too much to expect the Federal Trade Commission to hop on the Enron investigation bandwagon and look into whether Bush violated truthinlabeling laws during his campaign when his pledges of compassionate conservatism were stump speech favorites But it should Because weve heard precious little of them since Bush took the oath of office While many of our citizens prosper the freshly anointed president said in his inaugural address a year ago others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country And those nagging doubts are only aggravated by the behavior of Enron executives who continue to prosper even as thousands watch their jobsand their lifes savingsdisappear Candidate Bush was so eager to paint himself as a Compassionate Conservative that he even dared to impugn the moral supremacy of the free marketblasphemy in the eyes of his partys doctrinaire right wing The invisible hand works many miracles said Bush during the summer of evoking Adam Smiths famous paean to market forces but it cannot touch the human heart This simple truth lies at the core of the need for fair and rational government regulation of industry All too often after all the human heart is filled not with goodness but with greed selfishness and a desire for profit at any cost Too bad Bush left this noble idea on the campaign trail Since taking office the hallmark of his administration has been an unwavering belief in the free markets invisible hand In the last year the president and his antiregulatory appointees have take a breath abandoned a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide repealed workplace ergonomic rules designed to improve worker safety proposed reversing regulations protecting million acres of national forest from logging and road building and canceled a looming deadline for auto makers to develop prototype highmileage cars And thats just a partial list Not even the rapacious excesses of the Enron debacle have quelled the drive for deregulationor the ardor of Enron Conservatives who champion the cause Pat Wood Lays handpicked choice to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission insists that the collapse of Enron doesnt seem to be tied too much to deregulated energy markets You know that something is rotten in Washington when the top energy industry regulator is so unabashedly antiregulation Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is another Enron Conservative who sees the energy giants collapse as an aberration not a smoking gun He dismisses Enrons demise as an inhouse problem and continues slaving away on a deregulation bill that would make Lay proud Then theres Lawrence Lindsey the presidents top economic advisor and a former advisor to Enron who went so far as to claim that the Enron disaster is a tribute to American capitalism And Sept was a tribute to Islamic ingenuity Not that long ago

President Dick Cheney to explain fully his closeddoor meetings with the fallen energy giant After a ridiculous insistence on secrecy Cheney acknowledges that yes he and his advisers met with Enron before and after writing an industryfriendly report on energy The guest list at sessions of Cheneys energy task force was kept secret most likely to cover the oil and gas interests who prepped the White House on what to write The EnronCheney gettogethers arent a huge surprise Enron and its employees gave to the Bush presidential campaign in CEO Ken Lay was a confidant of the president offering advice on choices for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and extolling deregulation of electricity prices in the depths of the California energy crisis The result of the meetings was an energy blueprint produced by Cheney tilted heavily to more drilling exploration and coal mining and dismissing energy conservation The repeated Enron meetings lend more substance to claims that the White House is on autopilot when it comes to energy oil and gas interests come first and theres no need to study any other options Cheneys clumsy delays in acknowledging Enrons access is a reminder of the White Houses tunnel vision on the topic But the meetings dredge up another embarrassing matter Did Enron hint at its collapsing finances that ended in bankruptcy last month Cheney claims Enrons money troubles never came up But given the companys insider status its worth pursuing further Did the White House have advance word of the companys deepening problems that made it the largest bankruptcy in

Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company For months the White House has refused to hand over any information about the closeddoor meetings of Vice President Dick Cheneys energy task forcea group that was heavy on energy executives including Enron Corp Chief Executive Kenneth L Lay Both Rep Henry A Waxman DLos Angeles and the congressional General Accounting Office have insisted that the workings of the task force be disclosed The White House has steadfastly maintained it is not obligated to do so But considering the impact of the energy recommendations issued in May from drilling for oil in Arctic wilderness to weakening the Clean Air Act Americans should be privy to the making of these decisions The collapse of Enron Corp which has led to a federal criminal investigation just bolsters the argument The links between administration officials and Enron starting with President Bushs own ties to the nowdisgraced Lay are going to get deserved scrutiny from several congressional committees Democrats are gleeful at having such a fat target in a congressional election year Yet the White House continues releasing too little too late In a Jan letter to Waxman White House counsel David S Addington states that Cheney or members of his energy task force met six times with Enron executives Once Cheney met with Lay All of the meetings may have been perfectly innocent But the adamant refusal of the White House to explain what took place not only creates the appearance of impropriety but also illuminates a dangerous penchant for secrecy Whether its keeping Congress out of the loop or preventing historians from examining past presidential papers this is too often the administration mindset Some of Waxmans requests may be picayune He is asking for example about any communication that may have taken place between Cheney and Lay at a panel discussion on energy matters held at an American Enterprise Institute forum in Colorado in June But the bulk of Waxmans questions are not unreasonable Given the enormity of the Enron collapse and the companys seeming role in determining US energy policy it seems fair to ask for details about the meetings any requests for changes in federal policies by Enron executives copies of documents presented and the names of those attending The vice presidents office obviously doesnt see it that way White House counsel Addington ends his paltry letter to Waxman by saying It is our hope that submission of this information will help you avoid the waste of time and taxpayer funds on unnecessary

motion to shed part of its crown jewels Friday The hearing follows a competitive auction of the energy business planned for Thursday We expect the hearing to go forward said Brian Rosen of Weil Gotshal Manges law firm which represents the bankrupt company Once the company and its official creditors committee have agreed upon a suitor for the struggling business and submits the offer to the court approval should follow shortly thereafter according to Rosen The sale is seen as an important step in reviving Enrons energytrading operations which generated about of the companys billion in revenue last year Enron hopes that a creditworthy partner will take a stake in the business to be renamed New Energy Trading Co while Enron maintains a stake The idea to bring business back to what was once the nations dominant natural gas and electricity trader For their part many of the creditors that filed objections because of concern over which assets will be affected and what will be done with the proceeds of any sale said its likely theyll be able to resolve their differences with Enron ahead of or during Fridays court hearing I think that most of the concerns will be answered quickly said Aaron Cahn of Carter Ledyard Milburn law firm which represents a consortium of oil creditors that had requested clarification of which assets will be sold among other requests Enron has said that it expects multiple bids for the energytrading units hardware and software including its valuable online trading platform but not for the units trading book the value of which the company estimates at billion to billion This alleviates the concerns of some creditors who were uncertain about whether the sale would affect their trading contracts with Enron Also since proceeds from the sale are likely to come in as future revenue stream according to Weil Gotshals Rosen there may not be any immediate cash to put into escrow as Enron creditors including Wiser Oil Co have requested If an allcash order is received and approved by the company and its creditors committee then Enron will look to the court to decide how the proceeds will be handled said Rosen Whatever happens Enron and its advisors feel

Bustamonte Gary I just sent this to your other email address The Lt Gov was in on this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings so this may come up The credibility of these former SDGE employees was very weak in the hearing and their allegations are absurd To California news media covering electricity crisis As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas Electric employees we have been in the news a bit lately To add a bit of clarity to the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through each of the three claims and our response To more fully understand the situation please read the attached story that appeared in the LA Times yesterday These reporters had the logs that were stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks ago We went through these log books line by line with these reporters They also obtained confidential information from the CalISO during these three days January that indicated that we were operating at their instruction when ramping up an down the units This is because the ISO purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the states supply and demand is in balance This is a common practice and done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide this service Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when they were made formally in Senator Dunns committee hearing Friday although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone I understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDGE employees tomorrow We had tried to personally meet with the governor last summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and megawatts of peaking plants in and and were not able to Tom Williams Director of Public Affairs Duke Energy North America Morro Bay CA Los Angeles Times via Dow Jones Publication Date Saturday June Page B Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By DOUG SMITH CARL INGRAM and RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS SACRAMENTO Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused officials of Duke Energy Co of manipulating Californias crippled electricity market for higher profits but records and interviews show that the company was responding partly to state instructions Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistleblower allegations which called them baseless The former employees at Dukes South Bay facility told a legislative committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up and down like a yoyo in an apparent gambit to drive up profits In support of the allegations the workers produced logs showing Dukes trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power emergencies over three days in midJanuary Duke officials who will testify in the weeks ahead said the up and down throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state which had paid the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System Operator Moreover CalISO which in the past has accused power firms of withholding electricity to boost prices stressed Friday that it regularly directs generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside CalISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Its energy that can be called upon instantly to meet a fluctuation in demand or within minutes or within an hour Certainly we call on standby services regularly to meet these fluctuations The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more than years first for San Diego Gas Electric and later under contract for Duke They were let go by Duke in April Former power plant mechanics Ed G Edwards Jr and Glenn D Johnson accused Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation capacity beginning in leaving workers puzzled Managers brushed aside questions about the activity saying they were for economic reasons the workers said Sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days Sometimes it would be down for two or three hours It didnt make sense Johnson said He said the phrase appeared to be another way to explain limiting the load or curtailing the load to boost prices Instead of running two units to make the same price Johnson said you could run one unit and make three times the price Some energy experts argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in Californias tight electricity market The third worker Jimmy Olkjer an assistant control room operator said such actions began after Duke began operating the plant Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman asked Olkjer whether SDGE operated in the same manner No he said Edwards one of the exmechanics said prolonged repairs by Duke were part of the apparent gaming of the power market Once he was directed to throw away pallets of power plant parts he said Some of it was brand new stuff in its original packaging I used a forklift took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets Edwards said He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part which in the past would have been readily available Duke officials bragged about their moneymaking ways Edwards said At employee parties after the first year of operation Duke executives boasted that they made more money than they had expected in five years Dunn and Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey a committee member said later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers testimony but that it did not constitute a smoking gun Both said they would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators Duke officials who will testify before the committee next month said CalISO controlled much of the ramping activity Our employees followed the directions of the grid operator said Bill Hall who oversees Dukes plant operations in the West Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the plants inventory system said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman Duke has decreased outages and significantly increased its production since purchasing the plant he said The proofs in the numbers he said One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the previous owner SDGE as well as by Duke CalISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities with Duke But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and standby power at the plant That electricity can be ordered on and off the system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid In the January period focused on at Fridays hearing records show that three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver standby power The fourth unit was shut for servicing On Jan for example records show that the agency called on one unit to increase output by megawatts at am and reduce it by that same amount two hours later Then at noon the agency ordered more megawatts cutting it back to at pm By days end the agency had asked for an additional megawatts A second unit was instructed to add or more megawatts four times on the same day A third unit was ramped up or down times bouncing from zero to as high as megawatts The records show only power that ISO actually needed The agency refused to disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had not called on But after reviewing records for the midJanuary period CalISO manager of markets Brian Rahman said The most viable reason why any one unit would not have been producing would have been for operating reserve Here is a link to the release below californiareleasesnrasp DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO June SACRAMENTO Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator ISO to track fluctuations in electricity demand and the plant operated at top reliability The company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energys own direction The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas Electric SDGE who were not hired as part of the new operating team when Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April Bill Hall vice president of Duke Energys western operations said These allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated by people who dont know the full story Hall reviewed the charges and the facts Charge Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices during times when energy supplies were short The facts The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to meet system reliability and Duke Energys contractual commitments While the three exworkers allude to log books from the plant control room with notations from Duke Energy Trading Marketing DETM the former SDGE South Bay employees apparently did not know that that the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator Our records of ISO directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations Charge The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO prices The facts South Bays megawatt jetfueled unit was designed principally to provide startup power to the stations steam units This unit has been made available to provide as much energy as possible to California during the states energy crisis During the period in question the jetfueled unit was being operated because the price of jet fuel was substantially less than the cost of natural gas This resulted in lower marginal costs The megawatt unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energys California contractual commitments This electricity was not being bid into the ISO market so there was no way it could have influenced ISO market prices Charge Inventory management including throwing out spare parts at South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs The facts At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable for service The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard industry practices Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for South Bay when we assumed operations for the plant in We retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of inventory that was damaged or obsolete Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our power plants operating during Californias energy crisis Duke Energy continues to deliver real solutions to the states energy needs and to operate its business with integrity Duke Energy will hold a media briefing

Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday

Bustamonte Gary I just sent this to your other email address The Lt Gov was in on this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings so this may come up The credibility of these former SDGE employees was very weak in the hearing and their allegations are absurd To California news media covering electricity crisis As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas Electric employees we have been in the news a bit lately To add a bit of clarity to the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through each of the three claims and our response To more fully understand the situation please read the attached story that appeared in the LA Times yesterday These reporters had the logs that were stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks ago We went through these log books line by line with these reporters They also obtained confidential information from the CalISO during these three days January that indicated that we were operating at their instruction when ramping up an down the units This is because the ISO purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the states supply and demand is in balance This is a common practice and done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide this service Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when they were made formally in Senator Dunns committee hearing Friday although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone I understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDGE employees tomorrow We had tried to personally meet with the governor last summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and megawatts of peaking plants in and and were not able to Tom Williams Director of Public Affairs Duke Energy North America Morro Bay CA Los Angeles Times via Dow Jones Publication Date Saturday June Page B Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By DOUG SMITH CARL INGRAM and RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS SACRAMENTO Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused officials of Duke Energy Co of manipulating Californias crippled electricity market for higher profits but records and interviews show that the company was responding partly to state instructions Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistleblower allegations which called them baseless The former employees at Dukes South Bay facility told a legislative committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up and down like a yoyo in an apparent gambit to drive up profits In support of the allegations the workers produced logs showing Dukes trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power emergencies over three days in midJanuary Duke officials who will testify in the weeks ahead said the up and down throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state which had paid the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System Operator Moreover CalISO which in the past has accused power firms of withholding electricity to boost prices stressed Friday that it regularly directs generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside CalISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Its energy that can be called upon instantly to meet a fluctuation in demand or within minutes or within an hour Certainly we call on standby services regularly to meet these fluctuations The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more than years first for San Diego Gas Electric and later under contract for Duke They were let go by Duke in April Former power plant mechanics Ed G Edwards Jr and Glenn D Johnson accused Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation capacity beginning in leaving workers puzzled Managers brushed aside questions about the activity saying they were for economic reasons the workers said Sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days Sometimes it would be down for two or three hours It didnt make sense Johnson said He said the phrase appeared to be another way to explain limiting the load or curtailing the load to boost prices Instead of running two units to make the same price Johnson said you could run one unit and make three times the price Some energy experts argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in Californias tight electricity market The third worker Jimmy Olkjer an assistant control room operator said such actions began after Duke began operating the plant Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman asked Olkjer whether SDGE operated in the same manner No he said Edwards one of the exmechanics said prolonged repairs by Duke were part of the apparent gaming of the power market Once he was directed to throw away pallets of power plant parts he said Some of it was brand new stuff in its original packaging I used a forklift took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets Edwards said He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part which in the past would have been readily available Duke officials bragged about their moneymaking ways Edwards said At employee parties after the first year of operation Duke executives boasted that they made more money than they had expected in five years Dunn and Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey a committee member said later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers testimony but that it did not constitute a smoking gun Both said they would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators Duke officials who will testify before the committee next month said CalISO controlled much of the ramping activity Our employees followed the directions of the grid operator said Bill Hall who oversees Dukes plant operations in the West Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the plants inventory system said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman Duke has decreased outages and significantly increased its production since purchasing the plant he said The proofs in the numbers he said One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the previous owner SDGE as well as by Duke CalISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities with Duke But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and standby power at the plant That electricity can be ordered on and off the system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid In the January period focused on at Fridays hearing records show that three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver standby power The fourth unit was shut for servicing On Jan for example records show that the agency called on one unit to increase output by megawatts at am and reduce it by that same amount two hours later Then at noon the agency ordered more megawatts cutting it back to at pm By days end the agency had asked for an additional megawatts A second unit was instructed to add or more megawatts four times on the same day A third unit was ramped up or down times bouncing from zero to as high as megawatts The records show only power that ISO actually needed The agency refused to disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had not called on But after reviewing records for the midJanuary period CalISO manager of markets Brian Rahman said The most viable reason why any one unit would not have been producing would have been for operating reserve Here is a link to the release below californiareleasesnrasp DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO June SACRAMENTO Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator ISO to track fluctuations in electricity demand and the plant operated at top reliability The company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energys own direction The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas Electric SDGE who were not hired as part of the new operating team when Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April Bill Hall vice president of Duke Energys western operations said These allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated by people who dont know the full story Hall reviewed the charges and the facts Charge Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices during times when energy supplies were short The facts The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to meet system reliability and Duke Energys contractual commitments While the three exworkers allude to log books from the plant control room with notations from Duke Energy Trading Marketing DETM the former SDGE South Bay employees apparently did not know that that the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator Our records of ISO directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations Charge The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO prices The facts South Bays megawatt jetfueled unit was designed principally to provide startup power to the stations steam units This unit has been made available to provide as much energy as possible to California during the states energy crisis During the period in question the jetfueled unit was being operated because the price of jet fuel was substantially less than the cost of natural gas This resulted in lower marginal costs The megawatt unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energys California contractual commitments This electricity was not being bid into the ISO market so there was no way it could have influenced ISO market prices Charge Inventory management including throwing out spare parts at South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs The facts At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable for service The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard industry practices Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for South Bay when we assumed operations for the plant in We retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of inventory that was damaged or obsolete Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our power plants operating during Californias energy crisis Duke Energy continues to deliver real solutions to the states energy needs and to operate its business with integrity Duke Energy will hold a media briefing

Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy Copyright Dow Jones

Bustamonte Gary I just sent this to your other email address The Lt Gov was in on this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings so this may come up The credibility of these former SDGE employees was very weak in the hearing and their allegations are absurd To California news media covering electricity crisis As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas Electric employees we have been in the news a bit lately To add a bit of clarity to the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through each of the three claims and our response To more fully understand the situation please read the attached story that appeared in the LA Times yesterday These reporters had the logs that were stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks ago We went through these log books line by line with these reporters They also obtained confidential information from the CalISO during these three days January that indicated that we were operating at their instruction when ramping up an down the units This is because the ISO purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the states supply and demand is in balance This is a common practice and done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide this service Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when they were made formally in Senator Dunns committee hearing Friday although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone I understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDGE employees tomorrow We had tried to personally meet with the governor last summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and megawatts of peaking plants in and and were not able to Tom Williams Director of Public Affairs Duke Energy North America Morro Bay CA Los Angeles Times via Dow Jones Publication Date Saturday June Page B Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By DOUG SMITH CARL INGRAM and RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS SACRAMENTO Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused officials of Duke Energy Co of manipulating Californias crippled electricity market for higher profits but records and interviews show that the company was responding partly to state instructions Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistleblower allegations which called them baseless The former employees at Dukes South Bay facility told a legislative committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up and down like a yoyo in an apparent gambit to drive up profits In support of the allegations the workers produced logs showing Dukes trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power emergencies over three days in midJanuary Duke officials who will testify in the weeks ahead said the up and down throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state which had paid the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System Operator Moreover CalISO which in the past has accused power firms of withholding electricity to boost prices stressed Friday that it regularly directs generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside CalISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Its energy that can be called upon instantly to meet a fluctuation in demand or within minutes or within an hour Certainly we call on standby services regularly to meet these fluctuations The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more than years first for San Diego Gas Electric and later under contract for Duke They were let go by Duke in April Former power plant mechanics Ed G Edwards Jr and Glenn D Johnson accused Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation capacity beginning in leaving workers puzzled Managers brushed aside questions about the activity saying they were for economic reasons the workers said Sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days Sometimes it would be down for two or three hours It didnt make sense Johnson said He said the phrase appeared to be another way to explain limiting the load or curtailing the load to boost prices Instead of running two units to make the same price Johnson said you could run one unit and make three times the price Some energy experts argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in Californias tight electricity market The third worker Jimmy Olkjer an assistant control room operator said such actions began after Duke began operating the plant Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman asked Olkjer whether SDGE operated in the same manner No he said Edwards one of the exmechanics said prolonged repairs by Duke were part of the apparent gaming of the power market Once he was directed to throw away pallets of power plant parts he said Some of it was brand new stuff in its original packaging I used a forklift took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets Edwards said He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part which in the past would have been readily available Duke officials bragged about their moneymaking ways Edwards said At employee parties after the first year of operation Duke executives boasted that they made more money than they had expected in five years Dunn and Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey a committee member said later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers testimony but that it did not constitute a smoking gun Both said they would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators Duke officials who will testify before the committee next month said CalISO controlled much of the ramping activity Our employees followed the directions of the grid operator said Bill Hall who oversees Dukes plant operations in the West Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the plants inventory system said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman Duke has decreased outages and significantly increased its production since purchasing the plant he said The proofs in the numbers he said One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the previous owner SDGE as well as by Duke CalISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities with Duke But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and standby power at the plant That electricity can be ordered on and off the system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid In the January period focused on at Fridays hearing records show that three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver standby power The fourth unit was shut for servicing On Jan for example records show that the agency called on one unit to increase output by megawatts at am and reduce it by that same amount two hours later Then at noon the agency ordered more megawatts cutting it back to at pm By days end the agency had asked for an additional megawatts A second unit was instructed to add or more megawatts four times on the same day A third unit was ramped up or down times bouncing from zero to as high as megawatts The records show only power that ISO actually needed The agency refused to disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had not called on But after reviewing records for the midJanuary period CalISO manager of markets Brian Rahman said The most viable reason why any one unit would not have been producing would have been for operating reserve Here is a link to the release below californiareleasesnrasp DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO June SACRAMENTO Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator ISO to track fluctuations in electricity demand and the plant operated at top reliability The company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energys own direction The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas Electric SDGE who were not hired as part of the new operating team when Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April Bill Hall vice president of Duke Energys western operations said These allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated by people who dont know the full story Hall reviewed the charges and the facts Charge Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices during times when energy supplies were short The facts The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to meet system reliability and Duke Energys contractual commitments While the three exworkers allude to log books from the plant control room with notations from Duke Energy Trading Marketing DETM the former SDGE South Bay employees apparently did not know that that the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator Our records of ISO directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations Charge The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO prices The facts South Bays megawatt jetfueled unit was designed principally to provide startup power to the stations steam units This unit has been made available to provide as much energy as possible to California during the states energy crisis During the period in question the jetfueled unit was being operated because the price of jet fuel was substantially less than the cost of natural gas This resulted in lower marginal costs The megawatt unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energys California contractual commitments This electricity was not being bid into the ISO market so there was no way it could have influenced ISO market prices Charge Inventory management including throwing out spare parts at South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs The facts At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable for service The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard industry practices Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for South Bay when we assumed operations for the plant in We retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of inventory that was damaged or obsolete Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our power plants operating during Californias energy crisis Duke Energy continues to deliver real solutions to the states energy needs and to operate its business with integrity Duke Energy will hold a media briefing

power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy Copyright Dow Jones

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy Copyright

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones An investigation by Californias attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity persons familiar with the probe said Monday The sources including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer said generators arent likely to be prosecuted even though it appears they did withhold supply and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal one PUC commissioner said California Gov Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night spokesman Steve Maviglio said Maviglio refused to disclose details of the attorney generals briefing but said the investigation was ongoing We have not called off the dogs Maviglio said Were still pressing the attorney general to pursue the investigation The governor who has repeatedly blamed the states yearlong power crisis on market manipulation by generators is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to take legal action against generators but that claim was premature another PUC commissioner said The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and earlier this year but after dozens of interviews with economists traders and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal behavior We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace thats documented one of the commissioners said The question is whether thats illegal and I dont think it is The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices the other commissioner said because it passed a flawed deregulation bill The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers in the best interest of their shareholders to do exactly what they have done the commissioner said Unless theyre talking with each other and there is evidence of absolute colluding were not going to get to first base The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke Energy DUK Dynegy Inc DYN Mirant Corp MIR Williams Cos WMB Reliant Energy Inc REI and others but that too is going to be difficult How do you sue someone for being unethical the person in Lockyers office said A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldnt comment but said the probe is ongoing Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldnt comment on the investigation but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC The generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully Severin Borenstein director of the University of California at Berkeley Energy Institute said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust behavior Borenstein said Prosecuting generators is a longshot he said They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys were in the same room Phil Verlager an economist specializing in energy issues said generators didnt even act unethically because the setup of Californias deregulation law allowed generators to get away with withholding power Even if no smoking gun has been found tough talk by PUC President Lynch scared the suppliers the commissioner said They got the message that they ought to play the game Lynch didnt return calls for comment Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable prices even if it isnt illegal Borenstein said By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Calif GovEvidence May Allow Criminal Case Vs Generators By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California investigations have turned up a growing body of evidence that may allow the states attorney general to pursue criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power prices in the state the office of California Gov Gray Davis said Tuesday The governors office didnt detail that evidence however and persons familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence exists The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of civil and criminal actions Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a short written statement There is a growing body of evidence that may give the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by generators operating in the states wholesale electricity market Maviglio didnt disclose further details of the investigation Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld but hasnt been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal There is no evidence of criminal behavior one said It just doesnt exist S David Freeman senior energy adviser to Davis acknowledged the distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington DC about allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices It may not be criminal conduct but its a crime he said Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators because theres likely no smoking gun Any claim that the investigation hasnt turned up evidence of criminal activity is an overstatement Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said The investigation is ongoing she said Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent sharp decline in power prices in the West An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to prosecuting the energy companies so they will continue to play the game The governor who has repeatedly blamed the states yearlong power crisis on market manipulation by generators is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Calif Judge To Rule On Confidentiality For Generator Data Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge said Tuesday he will issue a written ruling on a lawsuit filed by Reliant Energy Inc REI against the states attorney general to prevent confidential subpoenaed documents from being shared with third parties Superior Court Judge George H Wu said he would take the case under submission and issue a written ruling in less than days Reliant Dynegy Inc DYN and Mirant Corp MIR agreed May to turn over confidential documents to California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who is investigating allegations of manipulation and criminal behavior in the states wholesale power market Reliant agreed to turn over the information which includes bid data as long as Lockyers office agreed not to

hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday Shares fell cents on Friday to a level not seen since as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the companys earnings announcement earlier this month The stock is down more than percent in two weeks and the company lost almost billion in market value Late this week the company decided to convert billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash The company put about billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of shortterm corporate IOU known as commercial paper Nothing spells confidence quite like cash which is what we want investors to understand said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the billion banked this week Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as good management decisions On Oct Enrons thirdquarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about ThenChief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow with the Enron boards approval had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest The partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in

the Houston Chronicle for Saturdays editions Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities still sees the move as somewhat confusing Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit

me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management BARRONS REVIEW PREVIEW Capital Markets Report Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Turning Up the Heat Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO Andrew S Fastow Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence Enron shares have plunged recently after it announced the probe and reported a million loss BARRONS The Trader Dow Jones Commodities Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Bulls Look To Recovery As Techs Lead The Surge By Andrew Barry In what undoubtedly will become a businessschool case study Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a fullblown financial crisis last week Enrons stock plunged to following a point drop in the prior week and the companys bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around By weeks end Enron had drawn down billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly billion in maturing commercial paper leaving it only about billion of net liquidity Enrons big energy trading operation which accounts for the bulk of the companys profits and most of its equity valuation now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies but the company is likely to remain an investmentgrade credit Moodys Investors Service now rates its debt Baa three notches above junk One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades concerned about Enrons viability push for settlement of the trades precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed LongTerm Capital Management in Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation Enron has resisted refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enroncreated partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly billion loss on that deal Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the companys credit ratings There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets including its moneylosing broadband business Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its secondquarter book value of a share but its worth noting that tangible book excluding goodwill was only a share Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enrons billion asset writedown and its stillmysterious billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships The thirdquarter book value wont be known until Enron releases its balance sheet which may not occur until its quarterly Q is released The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didnt demand it The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the companys leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts confidence in management The Street really didnt provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a billion valuation That value has since shrunk to billion Enrons woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets Until last week Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enrons financial health Enron had about billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed offbalancesheet debt Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years Judging from the companys rather meager credit lines Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets City Enron directors cash in shares By Simon English The Daily Telegraph P c Telegraph Group Limited London LEADING executives at Enron the troubled US energy giant cashed in shares worth more than m m

halved again this week and fell to below yesterday Enron declined to comment on the share sales Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to dispel uncertainty in the financial community by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enrons financial strength Enron will pay off debts of billion and keep another in cash He said We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow former chief financial officer

investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest The partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM CoInvestment did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the companys newer businesses such as broadband trading Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously But last week when the company reported a million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a billion reduction in shareholder equity new questions began to arise Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected but The Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence In drawing down the billion line of revolving credit this week the company put about billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer and often with more flexible terms Investors in commercial paper who are actually more like lenders since its actually a form of debt are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of shortterm investments The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit To some extent redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets which look at it negatively said Anatol Feygin an analyst with JP Morgan But reducing the companys debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools like a revolving line of credit could give great peace of mind to Enrons investors he said It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business which is really the core of their operations Feygin said Carol Coale an analyst with Prudential Securities still sees the move as somewhat confusing Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange mixed message she said Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back Is it a gesture for customers It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management Jeff Dietert an analyst at Simmons Co said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned In a worstcase scenario investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron That could lead to lower credit ratings which would force Enrons energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it Thus we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues Dietert wrote in a report Friday Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store For example a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco It was formed in with about million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets Chewco was run by Michael Kopper a managing director of Enrons Global Equity Markets Group Frankly that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity Feygin said Until now

price fell to another sixyear low Shares traded as low as yesterday before ending the day at down cents The move will raise the interest expense for the company because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional billion Enrons debt is rated investment grade But its bonds now trade below investment

today IN THE MONEY Enron From Energy Trader To Spinmeister By Carol S Remond Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column This column was originally published Wednesday NEW YORK Dow Jones With the value of its stock continuing to plummet E nron Corp ENE tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press r elease touting among other things increased liquidity The problem is that most of the socalled news was three days old recycled from the companys latest quarterly filing And investors werent fooled by the release Although the stock of the emba ttled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the rele ase climbing to a share from it quickly gave up most of its g ains One hour after the release Enron stock was back trading at a s hare down more than on the day They had to say something but really didnt have any new news Its quite incredible said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron Amid mounting fears that Enrons credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc DYN a merger that many see as the only way for E nron to avoid possible bankruptcy Enron began its press release by announc ing that it has closed on the remaining million of a previously annou nced billion in secured credit lines Great news given the way Enron has been burning through cash Except that investors who took time to read Enrons filing with the Securities and Exch ange Commission on Monday already knew that on November Enron cl osed a million new secured line of credit which will mature in the fo urth quarter of Readers of the companys Q also knew that the million credit was secured by the assets of Enrons Northern Natural Gas Co Meanwhile the real news everyone was waiting for an announcement about wh ether a million loan due next Tuesday had been extended has yet to be finalized Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to midDecembe r would be formalized soon Separately people familiar with the matter said JP Morgan Chase Co an d Citigroup Inc continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the syndicated loan which contains a clause that unbeknownst to many was tri ggered by Enrons ratings downgrade to BBB by Standard Poors Corp ea rlier this month The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the million note on November if it didnt post collateral Those people said that the syndicated loan which is built inside a structu red vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors around the world would likely be extended to the middle of when other bank loans to Enron come due About billion of Enrons billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May and will likely need to be re structured About million of the assets securing the million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan reducing the o utstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured according to the people familiar with the terms Meanwhile Dynegy also tried to rally although somewhat halfheartedly inv estors around its plan to acquire Enrons stock Dynegy said it was encoura ged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining million credit facil ity and news of the extension of the million loan Under the terms of the acquisition Enron holders would receive Dynegy share for each E nron share Investors however remain more circumspect unmoved by the whopping r isk premium currently attached to the merger Thats how much investors bu ying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come analys ts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enrons liquidity or lac k thereof going forward Were having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion from the banks even with the billion from Dynegy will provide enough liquid ity for Enron one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron Chevron Texaco w hich owns of Dynegy already injected billion into Enron Another billion is expected upon closing of the deal Carol S Remond Dow Jones Newswires om USA Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs By Ellen Chang Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Nov Reuters Houstons economy buffered by a broad and dive rse tax base should be able to

Barton Smith director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston said the layoffs will b e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive Robin Kapiloff an

energytradin g company the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas Du ring the past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revi sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billio n reduction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC filing Monday Enron disclosed hu ndreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possib ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t han billion in loans by the end of the year As of pm Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares fell or to each after having

about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about each or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerformula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme nt when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra ding relatively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houstonbased Dynegy Dynegy and Enron officia ls have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that

growing disclosur es of financial problems in recent weeks the company locked down the ret irement plan from Oct to Nov to make administrative changes which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed Enron which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc Houston becaus e of mounting financial problems has seen its stock price fall to on Wednesday from a peak of nearly a share last year The decline has bee n costly to participants in Enrons retirement plan because more than o f the k assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year according to one of the suits The first suit was filed Nov on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison Wright LLP a Houston law firm and the second was filed Tuesda y by Seattlebased Hagens Berman LLP Both seek classaction certification Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits A sp okeswoman also said the companys k plan offers participants invest ment choices one of which

Securities and Exchange Commission has la unched a formal investigation into the companys accounting and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c ompanies over losses in the companystock portion of their k plans Th e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu ing to offer company stock even after they became aware of serious busines s problems that would hurt the stock price All the suits are pending As with most of these companies Enron matches employee contributions to th e k with shares of Enron stock and also offers Enron stock as an inve stment choice in addition to a variety of mutual funds About billion of the plans billion in assets was

trustees of the Enron k plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril The suit filed by Hagens Berman also alleges that the company failed to wa rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock In additi on it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result s since in connection with the partnerships

as a result of the decline in Enrons stock I feel like I have been betrayed Mr Rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers I lost my savings my plans for the future everyt hing Under federal pension law companies are allowed to offer their own stock i n retirement plans and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto ck Enron doesnt let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat ching contributions to the k plan until age However plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes ts of the participants which includes choosing prudent investments Genera lly to prove that the plans administrators breached their fiduciary dutie s employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen t This presents a high hurdle so it is not

against Enron allege that thencurrent plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price Repr esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didnt require employee s to invest in the company stock and educated employees about the need for diversification The suit in which Mr Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct a day afte r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling billion in the third quarter Enron locked down the k plans asse ts preventing participants from selling Enron shares

Page Column c New York Times Company THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem ent case Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar thur Andersen in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the companys reported profits in recent years All of which raises the question Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee p of the accounting industry It is not an easy question to answer and not everyone is willing to rush t o judgment If you want to attack Andersen for Enron you need to know mo re than we know Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said this week But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases it is materiality In all three cases Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea d Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble The idea is that it doesnt much matter if a few little things we re gotten wrong But they can add up At Enron however they did not add up to that much a total of milli on over four years The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated It is not cle ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time To those who treasure the role of auditors the humiliation of Andersen is painful Back in the s it was Leonard Spacek Andersens managing par tner who warned that the professions existence is in peril because it was not showing enough independence His public prodding was crucial in ma king the industry do a better job Two decades ago when the issue on the t able was pension accounting Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules Now Andersens backbone is open to question It was evidence that senior pe ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the SEC to bring that suit which the firm chose to settle without a dmitting it had done anything wrong The partner that the SEC says looke d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations and Andersen says h e acted properly Lynn Turner who was chief accountant of the SEC at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un iversity says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap pened to Coopers Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s eries of highly publicized blown audits We got bludgeoned to death in the press he said People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps It was brutal but we deserved it We h ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting For Andersen to avoid that fate its relatively new chief executive Joseph Berardino who declined to be interviewed for this column will need to se t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr Spacek epitomized And then he will have to convince the public of that Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp Dynegy Inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult ibilliondollar deal The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energytrading comp any the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas During t he past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revised do wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billion redu ction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC filing Monday Enron disclosed hu ndreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possib ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t han billion in loans by the end of the year As of pm Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares fell or to each after having dropped Tuesday In excess of million shares traded Wednesday more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock Enrons bonds also again traded sharpl y lower market observers said The turmoil spilled over to Dynegys stock which also was among the most a ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange As of pm Wednesday Dyne gy shares fell to each On Wednesday Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi ve Chuck Watson said his company was working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued to perform due diligence on Enr on Under the merger agreement Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enrons financial and legal problems become severe e nough However some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so called material adverse change clauses They point to a decision earlier th is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc to c omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc even though Tyson a Springdale Ark foodproducts company had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBPs earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit Dynegy officials didnt return calls seeking comment To complete the deal twothirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou ld have to give their approval No dates for those votes have been set One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr on contained information Dynegy hadnt known about Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i nformation as part of the companys due diligence this person said It cou ldnt be determined what the new information was The merger agreement announced Nov calls for Dynegy to exchange share for each of Enrons roughly million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about each or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerformula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme nt when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra ding relatively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houstonbased Dynegy Dynegy and Enron officia ls have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about Dynegy share for each Enron share Such a ratcheting down wouldnt be without precedent in the deal According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations Dynegy reduced the ex change formula at least once prior to the Nov announcement because of En rons rapidly sinking stock price which at the beginning of this year was above a share In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street Go ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy A longtime Enron fan Mr Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha t the merger would help Dynegys earnings and whether Enron could recover the significant business that has been lost in its giant energytrading op erations The Enron machine continues to sputter Mr Fleischer wrote Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren egotiate the terms significantly Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcyl aw filing Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba nkers and customers an Enron bankruptcycourt filing is highly possible said Ralph Pellecchia a senior director at Fitch a creditratings agency On Wednesday Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not ch above noninvestmentgrade or junk status But Fitch also said it bel ieved Enrons trading partners had made significant cash collateral calls in recent days that are well in excess of previous expectations contrib uting to liquidity pressures Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir m of Weil Gotshal Manges which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate workout situations Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing an Enron spok eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor e doesnt expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger Since the m erger announcement Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them Enron sa id it made some progress improving its financial position The company said it reached a final agreement with units of JP Morgan Chase Co and Cit igroup Inc on the remaining million of a previously announced bill ion in secured credit lines Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym ent of an existing million note to midDecember from next week The sp okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet ed next month so that repayment

hurdle because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring substantially i dentical securities within a day period before or after that loss This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri ces now make them attractive buy candidates In addition the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w

the washsale rule by doubling up buyi ng additional stock or options waiting at least days and then selling the original stock to book the loss Investors double up by buying calls w hich locks a price

Energy WatchPlattsDirect To Launch In Rough Waters By Jeremy Bowden Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN SINGAPORE Dow Jones Credit concerns at Enron Online and repeated delays to the launch of eNymex have dramatically altered the outlook for online e nergy trading over recent months The bigoil backed Internet site Intercontinental Exchange or ICE has so far been the main beneficiary of its competitors problems with recent tr ade volumes jumping sharply But its growing hegemony may soon be challenge d by a very different online trading system run by Platts a unit of publi sher McGrawHill Cos MHP Aware of sensitivity to its role in oil markets from within the industry P latts is approaching electronic trading with a very different business mode l from existing commissionbased sites Platts sources say its new system dubbed PlattsDirect is designed initi ally at least as a communication device to enhance its existing role of assessing and publishing benchmark energy prices Its current telephoneba sed systems they say cant cope with rising liquidity all of which must be factored in when making its price assessments They hope PlattsDirect will develop as a master exchange providing a ne utral base for other exchanges to feed pricing information in order to co mpliment Platts leading role as price benchmark assessor and publisher PlattsDirect is more likely to charge a subscription fee than commissions sources said although a final decision has yet to be made Unlike some oth er systems PlattsDirect will offer no clearing or counterparty service While a launch date hasnt been fixed Platts hopes PlattsDirect will be up and running in early Nymex by contrast is without a launch date for its eNymex Internet system which has suffered repeated delays since its o riginal launch date of October Is Nymex Leaving It Too Late Some oil traders suggest Nymex has missed the boat in its efforts to deve lop electronic trading bogged down by its desire to keep local floor trade rs happy In September Nymex President J Robert Collins said the launch of eNymex h ad been delayed by factors including the bankruptcy of one of the systems developers Globalview Software Inc according to industry publications Oi l and Gas Journal and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly But several months later Globalview continues to be alive and well despit e legal action taken against it by Nymex and has posted a increase in sales so far this year A senior Globalview official said his company is co untersuing without providing further details ICE invited Nymex to join it last year but Nymex rejected the offer prefe rring to focus on its own electronic system In June ICE acquired Londons International Petroleum Exchange which plans to scrap floor trading and a dopt electronic trading for all its products Enron Corps ENE Enron Online faces even more serious problems than Nyme x Oil trading sources say it has seen a sharp reduction in trade volume ov er recent weeks as counterparties grow increasingly wary over the companys financial position The system Enron designed to reduce credit risk wher e Enron itself acts as a counterparty to every online trade appears to ha ve backfired Even if the system is successfully transferred to Dynegy Inc DYN which has agreed to take over Enron pending legal objections trading sources say counterparties are likely to be wary of placing so much risk with a sin gle company again leaving the Enron Online trading model at a disadvantage They added that unless the Dynegy takeover is quick Enron Online liquidity could dry up completely Enron itself has warned that reduced trading acti vity will hit fourthquarter earnings Platts Independence Physical Trade Advantageous While it doesnt appear keen to compete with other systems headon initiall y PlattsDirect has several advantages which could persuade traders to use its system A possible absence of commissions is of concern to Singapore br okers and probably other online sites too Platts sources claim the sites independence and resulting objectivity is a lso a major advantage over other sites But the concern for Platts is that that very independence also means it has no guaranteed support from within the trading community ICE by contrast was developed and is owned by a selection of companies in volved in the trading of oil including oil majors BP PLC BP Total Fina Elf SA TOT and Royal DutchShell Group RD and enjoys IPE support PlattsDirect is also able to offer physical trade unique so far among on line energy trading sites Some traders say Platts existing role as a publ isher of benchmark oil price assessments particularly in Asia is bound to attract trade to the new system Some companies will want to trade on PlattsDirect because prices from the system will be used when assessing benchmarks said one trader The majori ty of physical oil trade is priced against benchmarks rather than on a spot basis and most overthecounter derivative products are also settled agai nst Platts benchmark assessments including Nymex Brent and many on ICE Platts claims physical and derivative products worth US billion are trad ed against its benchmark quotes everyday and this makes influencing those quotes a priority for traders Platts also plans to use the prices of oil derivative trades from PlattsDir ect to improve the accuracy of its daily assessments of forward prices However Platts must be careful It not only faces wariness from existing i ndustrydriven sites it cant afford to undermine the independence of its parent company credit rating agency Standard Poors a unit of McGrawHi ll Part of the loss of faith in Enrons creditworthiness came as Moodys and S tandard Poors downgraded Enrons credit rating to Baa and BBB respecti vely just above junk bond status However justified the downgrade Standa rd Poors cant be seen to gain competitive advantage for a unit through a change in a clients credit assessment ICE is also considering the introduction of physical trade and could event ually publish competing benchmark assessments But without an existing pres ence in the energy benchmark publishing business ICE would face an uphill struggle And its owners involvement in trading could also be seen as comp romising its objectivity when assessing

to do busi ness with the company Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns said Michael Barbis an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners As a result the market per ceives Enron as needing more cash The very methods that contributed to Enrons rapid rise are generally seen now as the reason for its woes Enron established in grew from a modest natural gas pipeline company with annual revenue of less than billion to an energy giant with revenu e pegged at about billion this year To finance this explosive rate of growth the company created a vast and im penetrable network of affiliated entities or partnerships to divert billion s of dollars of debt which would have jeopardized Enrons credit rating and limited growth from its balance sheet But the offbalance sheet transactions caught up with the company in recent months with Enron announcing a million thirdquarter loss and disclo sed a billion reduction in shareholder equity in part because of the p artnerships

the low it was tr ading at before the merger deal was announced Analysts said that if the merger goes through Dynegy stands to gain consid erably The company estimates the addition of Enron will beef up its bottom line by about per cent or to cents a share next year a sizable c hunk of profit that would justify a share price in the to range The outlook for earnings over the next couple of years assuming the acqui sition of Enron is successful is significant said Mr Worms of Gerard Kl auer Mattison Despite Enrons latest troubles he maintained a buy ratin g on Dynegy with a month target of Dynegy has also taken moves to limit its downside The company is injecting billion of cash into Enron but it gets rights to Enrons prized kilometre Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its

former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Enron has acknowl edged it overstated net income by million million euros and wi ll need to restate five years of financial reports Citing concerns about the accounting industrys peerreview process Rep J ohn Dingell asked the Public Oversight Board to conduct a special investiga tion of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audit work for Enron Mr Bowsher said the oversight board wont open a special investigation le aving that to the SEC and the industrys qualitycontrol inquiry committee but will decide at its next meeting whether to take a hard look at recen t highprofile audit blowups Were probably going to want to look at some of these major audit failures and thats not limited to Andersen Mr Bowsher said He cited recent audit failures involving Cendant Corp Microstrategy Inc Sunbeam Corp and Waste Management Inc saying I think we ought to look at them all Former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner expressed disappointment at the ove rsight boards reluctance to exercise its investigative muscle given a ras h of financial restatements and frauds that have cost investors more than billion in recent years In light of losses that have reached the magnitude of the savingsandloan debacle its time for the POB to start carrying out investigations of wha ts happening at the audit firms Mr Turner said He said Rep Dingell is right to question the accounting professions abili ty to police itself through socalled peer reviews saying recent audit fai lures are evidence that the peerreview process is not as robust as it nee ds to be Firms that audit public companies must undergo peer review every three year s subjecting their work to scrutiny by a competing audit firm or a panel a ppointed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants In prac tice the Big Five firms hire each other to conduct the oversight with no requirement to rotate assignments and critics say reviewers arent as toug h as they could or should be Theres a tendency in the peer reviews even when problems are identified to regard them as isolated instances not evidence of a systemic failure at an audit firm said Douglas Carmichael an accounting professor at Baruc h College in New York Mr Bowsher defends peer reviews as a very rigorous thorough process bu t concedes they havent prevented a recent bout of problematic audits He s uggested that may be due to factors from bad judgment on the part of indivi dual partners to questions about applying accounting and auditing standards In Enrons case the qualitycontrol inquiry committee composed of about a dozen CPAs will investigate Andersens audit work but critics doubt it wi ll do much digging BusinessFinancial Desk Section A Employees Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company The rapid decline of the Enron Corporation has devastated its employees re tirement plan which was heavy with company stock and has infuriated worke rs who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunge d Through the k retirement plan employees chose to put much of their sa vings in Enron shares and the company made contributions in company stock as well But around the time Enron disclosed serious financial problems las t month the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrat ive change For several weeks as the stock lost much of its value workers stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated They were not allowed to switch investments at all even though the plan had far less r isky choices The unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for Enrons workers At the end of last year the k plan had billion in assets More than half wa s invested in Enron an energy conglomerate Since then the stock has lost percent of its value At Portland General Electric the Oregon utility acquired by Enron four yea rs ago some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars The utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work throug h their problems We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as or said Steve Lacey an emergencyrepair dispatcher for Portlan d General It pretty much wiped out every employees savings plan Shortly after it was frozen the articles started coming out about some o f the questionable activities of Enron Mr Lacey added The stock took a tremendous drop and we were pretty much helpless The loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on one investment Stock plunges similar to Enrons have also wiped out the re tirement savings of many employees of the Nortel Networks Corporation Luce nt Technologies Inc and Global Crossing Ltd The loss by Enrons workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits ma de by some senior Enron executives who sold stock during the last few year s Enrons chairman Kenneth L Lay made million during the first se ven months of by exercising stock options and more than millio n by exercising options during the three prior years Last week Mr Lay ag reed to forgo a million severance package after Enron traders and emplo yees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed acquisition of the company by Dynegy Inc while they were suffering Enron which is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissi on investigation of transactions among Enron and partnerships headed by the companys former chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow and a number o f shareholders suits now has an additional legal problem On Tuesday Steve W Berman a lawyer from Seattle who represented states a gainst the tobacco industry filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in H ouston seeking classaction status on behalf of Enron employees who lost mo ney on the stock through their retirement plan The lawsuit says that Enron schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fi duciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests They were promoting Enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching employees contributions with Enron stock when they knew the stock was ov ervalued and thats a breach of their fiduciary duties Mr Berman said in an interview yesterday Whats more he said the assets were frozen on Oct with the stock at even though Enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosur es about the companys accounting practices They knew the worst news was about to come out but they froze the stock he said Enron closed yesterday at The company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pendi ng litigation A spokeswoman Karen Denne said that the change in plan adm inistrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did n ot know the exact date the change was put into effect Like many other big companies Enron made its contributions to the plan in company shares But employees also chose to put much of their own contribut ions into the stock lured by its stellar past performance The company say s that percent of the Enron stock in the plan wound up there because emp loyees chose it and percent was the companys contribution A lot of people believed in the stock so it wasnt just the company matc h said an employee at Enrons headquarters in downtown Houston It was their own money too People are just shellshocked The stocks past performance had lured many workers Last year as the stoc k soared total assets in the k plan rose more than percent About percent of Enrons employees participate in the k plan The company generally matches employee contributions at cents on the d ollar up to percent of their salary with Enron stock which cannot be s old and put into another investment until the employee reaches age But Ms Denne said workers otherwise have a range of options in which to in vest their money Gerry OConnor a senior consultant with the Spectrem Group a consulting f irm based in Chicago said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze asse ts when administrators were switched If you dont you can wind up with misallocated money wrong statements and all kinds of complicating factors he said But a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many specialists in retirement planning Employees are taking a lot of risk b ut they dont think of it as such Mr OConnor said They say You know I work for this company and were doing great In addition to the swoon in their k plans Enron employees have watche d the value of their stock options wither Enron gave a far larger percenta ge of employees options than most companies do but now with the fall in E nron shares nearly all of those options are worthless Enrons tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its wo rkers in Oregon About percent of the employees of Portland Genera l which Enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash are invested in the k plan said Scott Simms a spokesman The losses he added have hit everyone including officers all the way th rough to other staff Its certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and others havent he said It was the same plan for everyone In an interview with The Oregonian in Portland Peggy Y Fowler Portland G enerals chief executive said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincide nce The timing couldnt have been worse she said We refer to our retirement program as a threelegged stool Social Secu rity the company pension and the k Ms

admired and politica lly influential companies Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating th e merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other en ergy traders An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally Nor he added was Dyn egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed But he indicated that the situation could change Ms Denne the Enron spokeswoman said that she was not aware of any attemp ts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal Dynegy issued a statement saying that its chief executive Chuck Watson was encouraged by the steps Enron had t aken with its bankers Mr Watson said the company was continuing its due d iligence on the deal Dynegys shares which rose as high as in the days after the merger was announced on Nov closed yesterday at down more than perc ent for the second consecutive day Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange cl osing at down That means the premium that Dynegy would be pay ing for Enron has risen to percent Analysts following Enrons debt said that bankers had little choice but to support the company given that most of Enrons bank debt is not secured T hat means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy they would receive no better treatment than the holders of more than billion in Enron bonds and other debt Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure billion in deb t that will come due by the end of If the Dynegy deal closed that would be the best thing for the banks said one analyst following the deb t James B Lee Jr vice chairman of J P Morgan Chase echoed that thought in a statement issued by Enron We believe the interests of

Enron to the brink the big creditrat ing agencies continued to step gingerly The agencies have held Enrons de bt rating one step above junk status knowing that downgrading it furth er would force the

in the nation s energy markets While Enron has been the nations biggest trader of elect ric power and natural gas many other companies including Dynegy make markets in those commodities Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron s financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind de als and limit their exposure to Enron Yet even one of Enrons most stubborn supporters was

out the future His hip hurt from arthritis and his lungs hurt from sarcoidosis but Rinar d knew on days like that hed be climbing poles for only four or five more years Thats because the yearold was pumping every dime he could into his k plan at work and getting a dollarfordollar match And the money was p iling up in the years he worked there Earlier this year Rinard had in his k plan Today its wort h about Thats because Rinard is a lineman with Enronowned Portland General Electr ic in Portland Ore In January Enron was trading for Wednesday it closed at a sh are Part of the reason that Rinard lost so much money is that Enron gives its e mployees their k match in company stock That was great when the stock was flying high but as the stock has tanked employee retirement accounts have evaporated Its fairly common for employers to give their k match in their own co mpany stock said Scott Alt assistant vice president of Aon Consulting a human resources consulting firm in Houston Its often cheaper for a company to provide stock because they dont have t o put out the cash said Alt who sets up k plans for companies And giving stock makes the employees shareholders which many executives be lieves breed loyalty They work a little harder when they own the company Alt said And employees like it except of course if the stock plummets At Enron the problem was compounded when many employees including Rinard saw Enrons stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire acco unt into Enron stock Enron executives were talking about how the stock price was poised to climb above a share he recalled It was going to Rinard and a coworker Steve Lacey have filed an Employee Retirement Inco me Security Act or ERISA lawsuit in Houston contending that Enron reckles sly endangered their retirement funds Steve Berman managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock Enron officials didnt emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive especially when things were going downhill said Berman who is hoping to get the suit certified as a classaction case Hes hoping to prove that the k plan executives failed to act responsi bly when they knew about serious business problems Berman is hoping to break some new legal ground with his case Its pattern ed after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their k contributions with com pany stock that later tanked That case is still in litigation Another troubling feature of the Enron k plan was that employees were not allowed to make trades for about a month Unfortunately the lockdown b egan Oct the day after Enron surprised the market that it was taking a billion aftertax thirdquarter charge to get out of bad investments Enron officials who did not return a telephone call for this column have said they had planned the lockdown for several months because it was changi ng plan administrators But that timing was disastrous for Rinard and his coworkers who couldnt s ell their shares between the time it was a share on Oct and when they could begin to trade again at less than a share I just watched it drop horrified Rinard said There wasnt a thing I c ould do about it Like many employees Rinards k retirement fund was the only thing he had And now Rinard is kicking himself for trusting his company too much Before the wheels came off the wagon retirement was a doable thing Rinard said The end was in sight Now after years of climbing poles Im just right back to where I star ted Business Financial Desk Enron Shares Fall Again on Doubts Energy A retreat by bankers or a credit downgrade could

the Thanksgiving weeken d traders said The stock market is closed today and open Friday for an ab breviated sessiontraditionally the lightest trading day of the year Enron shares plummeted on Tuesday in reaction to a filing Monday with t he Securities and Exchange Commission in which Enron disclosed the mil lion obligation The disclosure was a surprise even to the credit rating ag encies that have been in constant contact with Enron executives since the c ompanys finances began unraveling last month The rating agencies view is critical because under some controversial Enr on deals that have come to light recently a downgrade to junk level would be a trigger event requiring Enron to immediately pay billion to cre ditors the company said in Mondays SEC filing Such an event could instantly bankrupt the company analysts said Enron has been reeling since midOctober when it began disclosing details of deals involving limited partnerships organized by current or former comp any executives The partnerships purpose appears partly to have been to pu mp up Enrons reported profit while concealing large amounts of debt it was incurring The SEC has announced that it is investigating the situation In addition to announcing the delayed payment Enron said Wednesday that it had tapped the remaining million of a previously announced billion credit line from its chief lenders JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc Enron probably can restructure its debts and postpone most payments until M ay analyst Ronald M Barone of Standard Poors rating agency said Wednes day It is in the lenders

again Thanks Ann NEWS ELECTION PROPOSITION Sparks fly over utilities measure Consumer groups vs broad coalition Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER The San Diego UnionTribune A Copyright SACRAMENTO It looked like a triumph of legislative dealmaking when after a year and a half of talks a sweeping plan to deregulate electricity in California came together in the final hours of the legislative session two years ago The bill brokered mainly by state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon was not opposed by any specialinterest group The complicated measure sailed through both houses of the Legislature without a single no vote But then consumer groups took a second look They reached two main conclusions A promised percent rate reduction is phony they say and ratepayers should not have to pay for privately owned utilities illadvised investments in nuclear power plants Now the consumer groups backed by one of the biggest names in consumer protection Ralph Nader have placed an initiative on the Nov ballot Proposition that would make major changes in the deregulation plan passed two years ago Billions of dollars of ratepayer money has been committed not to a sustainable energy future but to the outright bailout of uneconomic nuclear and fossilfuel plants owned by investors said Nader Proposition prohibits ratepayers from being charged to pay off billion in bonds issued last year to finance a percent cut in electricity rates that took effect last January Furthermore the initiative promises a percent rate reduction by prohibiting utilities from charging ratepayers for the transition costs as they move nuclear and other uneconomical power plants into a deregulated system The ballot measure is alarming to opponents a broad coalition that includes nearly all of the major business labor agriculture and local government groups some environmental groups the Republican and Democratic parties and the leading gubernatorial candidates Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren Opponents say the initiative would be a severe setback for the deregulation process needed to bring more competitive electricity prices to California where rates have been percent higher than the national average The opponents also contend that the initiative could force taxpayers to pay off the billion bond drive up the cost of borrowing for state and local government by damaging bond credit ratings and ultimately result in higher rates for residences and businesses I think its fair to say Proposition is categorically the most disingenuous misleading anticonsumer proposition ever put on the ballot said Peace With heavy funding from utilities opponents have launched an extensive television ad campaign to defeat Proposition Backers of the measure say their campaign will probably be limited to grassroots work Some polls have shown Proposition with a lead But the statewide Field Poll which has decades of experience polling on ballot measures showed the initiative trailing by a ratio of nearly to Mark DiCamillo Field research director said that successful initiatives usually have a lead of about to in early polling DiCamillo said the results of the poll are very ominous for Proposition The stranded issue At the heart of the dispute is what has become known as the stranded costs of the three large privately owned California utilities San Diego Gas Electric Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric The rates that the utilities could charge in the past were set by the California Public Utilities Commission In exchange the utilities had little or no competition and they were required to serve all creditworthy customers in their service areas The utilities invested in nuclear power plants and at the direction of regulators also made longterm contracts at relatively high rates to ensure a stable supply of electricity from sources that minimized pollution But in a deregulated market the utilities cannot sell power from nuclear plants and their longterm contracts at competitive prices Thus the utilities cost of paying off the debt on their nuclear power plants and other longterm contracts is said to be stranded The nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office said the nuclearrelated stranded costs for the three utilities is about billion Estimates of their total stranded costs are as high as billion Peace and the backers of the deregulation legislation argue that it would be unfair and illegal to force the utilities to pay their stranded costs because the state changed the rules of the game and the marketplace A federal court ruled against a New Hampshire restructuring plan last year that would not have allowed a utility to recover its stranded costs The utilitys lawsuit argued that the plan violated the contracts and takings clauses of the US Constitution The California plan allows the utilities to pay off their stranded costs in two ways The utilities received billion from a bond issue that will be paid off by ratepayers over years and the utilities can add a Competition Transition Charge to ratepayer bills until March Meanwhile rates are capped and the amount of the competition surcharge that could be added to ratepayer bills shrank or disappeared last summer as energy costs soared There is no guarantee that all of the stranded costs will be paid off under the plan Pacific Gas Electric a Northern California utility with hydroelectric power sources is said to have plenty of room under the rate cap and may recover all of its stranded costs But some think that San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison could fall short of full recovery In the view of the backers of Proposition the deregulation legislation is far too generous to utilities The consumer advocates say that the shareholders of the investorowned utilities should share risk as well as profits particularly from the nuclear power plants Harry Snyder of Consumers Union said that other states such as Pennsylvania and Illinois are not asking their ratepayers to pay all of the stranded costs of utilities Proposition would prohibit ratepayers from paying most of the transition costs and all of the bond payments resulting in a rate reduction of at least percent A disputed preliminary staff report from the state Energy Commission estimated that the reduction could be percent The bond deal Most of the controversy has centered on the billion bond issue After the amount was determined by the Public Utilities Commission the bond was issued by private trusts created through the state Infrastructure Bank The bond refinances some longterm utility debt at a lower interest rate Peace said ratepayers save billion on the amount that would be paid on the debt if there had been no refinancing Furthermore said Peace the bonds allowed the deregulation legislation to include a percent rate reduction that took effect last January He said the lower rates not only benefit customers but also thwart unscrupulous competitors I didnt want a bunch of flybynight operators coming in here with all of the ripoffs that we saw during the deregulation of telephones said Peace But the consumer advocates say that the bond payments will offset most of the rate reduction making the alleged shortterm savings from the deregulation little more than a shell game What they did was deny the percent rate reduction said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network or TURN We ended up with a rate reduction of to percent by financing the entire thing and making us pay for years Opponents have been running television ads contending that passage of Proposition could result in the state meaning taxpayers paying off the billion bond rather than the utilities and their shareholders as intended by the authors of the initiative But many think that the courts citing longstanding laws covering contracts would be virtually certain to overturn the provision in Proposition that prohibits ratepayers from paying off the bond Under the existing deregulation the bonds are in essence being financed by ratepayers After talking to experts the Legislative Analysts Office concluded that the probability of taxpayers becoming responsible for the bond is very low The possibility is not even mentioned in the analysts discussion of Proposition in the ballot pamphlet One of the coauthors of the initiative Mike Florio of TURN conceded at a legislative hearing that the provision barring ratepayers from paying off the bond is likely to be overturned in court If ratepayers are charged for the bond payments the initiative has a fallback provision that is intended to require utilities to reduce their rates to offset the bond payments made by ratepayers Consumer groups drop support California and other states began to move toward deregulation after a federal law removed restrictions on the ownership of powergenerating facilities and made it easier for independent power generators to use existing transmission lines Consumer groups and some legislators said that a California Public Utilities Commission decision on deregulation guaranteed full recovery of stranded costs and was skewed toward businesses and big customers at the expense of residential users At first consumer groups welcomed the legislation put together by Peace and others as an improvement over the PUCs plan A fourpage letter from TURN and the San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network expressed some reservations about the plan but concluded with these words However we will not oppose a bill which under difficult circumstances has successfully incorporated a number of the concerns of residential and smallbusiness customers But after more study Proposition was written by a group of consumer advocates including Florio of TURN Snyder of Consumers Union and Harvey Rosenfield whose Proposition cut insurance rates a decade ago Backers of the deregulation legislation accuse the consumer groups of betrayal and breaking a deal while the consumer advocates denounce the legislation as a fraud and a ripoff Peace and Snyder who once had a good working relationship are now exchanging bitter barbs Snyder said of Peace He is doing the bidding of the utilities not the public and he is really a disgrace to democracy Peace said he has never been so disgusted with political opponents It isnt so much the issue as it is their total disrespect for truth and for the process itself The consumer groups used a contribution of about from the Public Media Center a nonprofit organization in San Francisco to gather the voter signatures needed to place the initiative on the ballot Opponents of the initiative have suggested that the Public Media Center laundered contributions from outofstate energy companies and may have exceeded the political contribution limit for nonprofit organizations Herb Chao Gunther Public Media Center president said the organization has received no contributions from outofstate energy companies He said the organization which grossed million during the last two years is well within the contribution limits for nonprofit organizations based on revenue Its the classic defensive posture of trying to make us the issue Gunther said of the allegations from Proposition opponents Proposition What it does Changes a state law deregulating the electric industry Electric utilities would be barred from charging customers to recover the cost of nuclear power plants Customers could not be charged to repay billion worth of bonds issued last year to finance a rate reduction Requires a percent reduction in electricity rates rather than the percent reduction currently required by deregulation Arguments for Privately owned utilities pushed through a deregulation law that allows them to raise electric rates to pay off their moneylosing investments in nuclear power plants The bonds used to cover the cost of a phony percent rate cut would be paid off by private utilities not consumers or taxpayers Consumers would get an honest percent rate cut not covered by backdoor payments to private utilities A study suggests that rates eventually could be cut by a third Supporters Consumers Union Ralph Nader Harvey Rosenfield The Utility Reform Network and League of Women Voters Arguments against Taxpayers would be liable for the billion bond repayment potentially causing a major cut in funding for schools and other services or a tax increase Changing the source of repayment for the billion bond would jeopardize state and local bond ratings The plug would be pulled on a deregulation plan that eventually will produce permanent electricity rate reductions through a competitive market system The poorly written measure would trigger a major court battle Opponents California Chamber of Commerce California School Employees Association California Organization of Police and Sheriffs Environmental Defense Fund Planning and Conservation League California Taxpayers Association Democratic and Republican parties PICS CHART Caption No charge Proposition would prohibit utilities from charging ratepayers for much of the

Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS Only a few unplug Despite deregulation of consumers stay with same power firms Craig D Rose STAFF WRITER The San Diego UnionTribune C Copyright State Sen Steve Peace can take credit for coauthoring Californias electricity deregulation bill legislation that appeared to revolutionize the power market and provide an array of choices to consumers But when it comes to his own home Peace hasnt revolutionized anything His household is still drawing current from SDGE Here is where my wifes skepticism is said the Democrat from El Cajon And she makes the decisions The Peace family belongs to a very big club About percent of the states consumers continue to receive electricity from their local utility despite the nominally competitive market now in place In fact a full six months after deregulation of the states billion power industry the outcome remains short of electrifying In August about of the million utility customers switched to a new power provider But during the same period switched back to their local utility Overall about percent of the load in competitive markets has switched to new providers with utility companies retaining the percent of the market theyve traditionally held If consumers are underwhelmed wouldbe competitors also express surprise at the lack of competition in the newly opened market Of the that signed up to be new power providers only five or six are legitimate power providers said Frederick Bloom chief executive officer of Commonwealth Energy which claims customers Under Californias deregulation plan SDGE and other local utilities have retained their monopolies over regional power grids But there is supposed to be competition in the powergeneration business Companies registered with the California Public Utilities Commission win the right to sign up customers and supply power to a state pool in amounts equivalent to the usage of their customers And hundreds of companies signed up to compete But the new power companies say that technical hassles and the burden of paying utilities about billion for their unprofitable nuclear plants and other investments socalled stranded costs shouldered by all ratepayers is limiting their ability to truly compete Many find theyre unable to offer much if anything beyond the percent rate reduction mandated to all ratepayers under the states deregulation law The payback of stranded costs meanwhile has provoked Proposition a voter initiative that would rewrite terms of the open power market and cancel the payoff to utilities while promising deeper rate cuts to small power users If smaller users have found little to excite them in the new market some larger commercial power users have found savings in the deregulated market Collectively these larger users have switched about percent of their load to new providers A small number of residential consumers also are unplugging from local utilities for green power electricity said to be generated by means other than burning a fossil fuel Peace says all this is what he expected This is probably the single most complex transition of any single market Peace said Im stunned by how smoothly it has gone But Harvey Rosenfield a consumer activist leading the effort to pass Proposition says consumer indifference proves that Californias deregulation is a total fraud Its a devastating indictment of the way deregulation was crafted by the Legislature to destroy competition for residential ratepayers Rosenfield said Either way deregulation has opened the door to small savings for at least a few local power users The San Diego Association of Governments which purchased about million in power annually from SDGE hopes to cut about million from its yearly power bill by purchasing its energy from Commonwealth Energy Corp in Tustin The savings were hard to find The association had to twice bid out its power needs before finding a vendor that could provide savings worth the effort to switch Even with a vendor in hand the changeover has been prickly Its a very detailed process for switching each account said Steven Sachs senior planner with SANDAG What had been expected to be a day process is now nearing completion after more than three months he said We hope the headache was mostly at the front end Sachs said The real issue is that all local governments have to be in the energy market so its a great chance for these people to learn about what is going on Macys department stores in San Diego have also unplugged from SDGE and contracted for power from New Energy Ventures The department store chain made the switch to save money said Russ Brown energy manager for Macys Western division but he declined to discuss the amount of savings the stores hope to achieve Nobody does this to lose money Brown said New Energy Ventures which is supplying power to Macys meanwhile touts itself as the biggest winner in the new market The Los Angelesbased company says its won about percent of the power load now being supplied by companies other than the major utilities The company says the key to its success has been sharedsavings contracts with customers in which the power company and its customers share the savings that are achieved through the relationship said Michael Peevey the companys chief executive officer Smaller users Peevey noted that such savings are unavailable to residential and small commercial customers The automatic percent rate cut plus the stranded cost payments make it difficult for new companies to compete against the utilities for smaller power users We look forward to the time in when the utilities industrys stranded costs are paid by customers so that we can begin to provide truly significant reductions in energy costs for customers said Peevey Arthur ODonnell editor of California Energy Markets a weekly newsletter based in San Francisco agreed that the rate cut and the burden of stranded costs has eliminated the potential for lower prices for most Californians Attempting to compete on price under the current market structure can be fatal ODonnell added who noted that at least three companies competing for residential customers have already defaulted unable to deliver the power they promised consumers and forced to turn their accounts back to utilities Thats the first solid evidence of people getting washed out of the market said ODonnell Peace says small customers will have more significant choices in power company offerings within a few years It was always our preference in the Legislature that the transition to competition in the residential arena not be pushed fast because residential customers are vulnerable to scams said Peace Moving slowly will allow residential power users to become more sophisticated about their choice In the meantime he said small customers have benefited from the percent rate cut plus from the boost to the state economy from the savings that larger companies are achieving in their power bills Green power niche That said green power has found a niche in the new market although these offerings require customers to pay up to percent above the cost of conventional power ODonnell calls green power the most robust sector of the new market Among the leaders in the niche is Green Mountain Energy Resources of Vermont The company declines to disclose the number of customers it has signed up beyond saying its greater than and should exceed by yearend Douglas Hyde president of Green Mountain believes that more than percent of Californias millions power users are potential green power customers The lack of active price competition is not what we expected but on the other hand were convinced the value of the green power we bring to the market will excite people said Hyde We sell cleaner resources to customers who care about the market That customer base may extend beyond what many expected Edison Source for example a unit of Edison International has won a contract to supply power from renewable sources to several of Toyota Motor Sales USAs offices in California Other commercial users have also gone green said ODonnell But any revolution in the California market is unlikely for several years he said What has happened is kind of what was expected ODonnell said Deregulation was not meant for residential customers Trickle but no bolt A few thousand of SDGEs million

trying to find someone Thanks for an understandable article Lana Steffen Administrative Analyst Liberal KS Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

regulators that delaying approvals for new power generation may result in future power shortages and significant price increases NYISO President and CEO William Museler stated New York is headed toward a very serious situation unle ss it acts immediately to get new supplies sited within its borders and embarks o n substantial customer choice programs Between and the demand for power in New York rose by Mw while power generation only increased MW If that trend continues the percent reserve would dip to a dangerously low eight percent which could cause prices to rise as much as percent b

loved this invention Community Power Corp based in Littleton Colorado has developed a machine that turns coconut shells into electricity The company which develops and operates energy services for rural communities around the world recently shipped its first machine to a small village of people in the Philippines The machine is called the Small Modular Biopower System and uses coconut shells to make clean combustible gas that is fed into a standard combustion engine where it form s heat mechanical and electrical power Robb Walt owner of Community Power Corp believes a market for their product is immense Almost half of the worlds population does not have access to electricity or sustainable cooking fuel Instead nearly billion is spent annually on products that many consider dangerous to the environment including kerosene batteries candles and firewood Community Power was able to turn the coconuts into clean combustible gas with the technical and financial support of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL Shell Renewables and the California Energy Commission In the company won a contract from the US Department of Energy through NREL to make the coconut machine Once the machine is operational villagers should expect to pay a fraction of the per kilowatt they currently pay using batteries

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

Public Agencies Too Power DWP is among three governmentrun producers cited as driving prices up Spokesmen deny any market manipulation ROBERT J LOPEZ RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company Governmentowned utilities including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite Californias exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall according to public and confidential records For months Gov Gray Davis legislators and consumer advocates have chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into darkness and economic chaos But they are just part of the equation A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that have allegedly manipulated the electricity market While the document does identify outofstate merchants criticized for gouging it also discloses for the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized profits in the volatile spot market The documentwhich decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a recent state studysingles out three governmentrun agencies as consistently trying to inflate prices They are the DWP the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canadas BC Hydro in British Columbia Like a number of privately owned generators these three producers offered power at a range of high prices and sometimes in large amounts when the state was most desperate They also helped saddle Californias three largest utilities with billions of dollars in debtleading one Pacific Gas Electric to seek bankruptcy protection last week The study by the California Independent System Operator or CalISO analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for large suppliers in the spot or realtime market from May to November The study accounted for factors such as rising production costs increased demand periods of scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy competitive market Money earned above that was called excess profits No entitypublic or privateearned as much in alleged excess profits as British Columbias Powerex the state records show They were the most aggressive bidders said Anjali Sheffrin author of the coded study They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in said Sheffrin who did not discuss any companies by name The Canadian agency reaped million in alleged excessive profitsseveral times the amount collected by all but one of the private generators Second on the list was Atlantabased Southern Co Energy Marketing now called Mirant which collected nearly million in alleged inflated earnings BC Hydro and Mirantalong with the DWP and other producerssay they played by the rules established under Californias flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the states troubles But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins We helped keep the lights on in California And the rates low for their own customers During the past year BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a rainy day account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America Los Angeles Department of Water and Power although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market where emergency purchases are made This according to state documents was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand The strategy also helped prop up prices keeping them from falling The DWPs average hourly bid or asking price for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsabased Williams Cos two major players in the national energy market In addition the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand the report said referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions DWP General Manager S David Freeman called the reports findings outrageous insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state Freeman said noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state He did acknowledge however that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce We have consistently charged CalISO our cost plus he said Its not as though were up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report they never took it personally If youre innocent he said you dont look at the criminal file Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in Californias deregulated market was the US governments Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at federal dams in the ColumbiaSnake River basin Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP records show but reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon recovery program Stephen Oliver a Bonneville vice president said his agency did not act improperly and has asked CalISO for detailed information on how it reached its conclusions He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading for lastminute electricity and offering to pay high prices From our point of view we bid what we had when we had it and we operated precisely within the terms of their rules Oliver said Those rulesand the bidding practices criticized by CalISOso distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp of Missouri which tried to act responsibly has bailed out It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier studiedslightly more than per megawatthour compared to Mirants the highest But the spot market as initially designed made sure that all suppliers offering power received the highest price paid in any hour The result Aquila collected an hour for power it was willing to sell at a singledigit price They werent the culprits said CalISOs Sheffrin Someone else drove that up Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California market because it was too unpredictable Although the company made money he said it also could have lost because of possible downward swings We looked at it and we didnt feel very comfortable with what we saw he said The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the price for everyone But Sheffrin said it hasnt made much difference because the overall prices are still excessive Were saying the patient is sick Sheffrin said of Californias electricity market It needs help and may die BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Top in Profits The California Independent System Operator says that a total of million in extra profits was reaped by

any conversations w Bailey Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on PM Susan J Mara PM To Mark NRON Richard nron Jeff nron Janel nron Karen NRON Sandra nron James D nron Harry nron Paul CT cc Subject OpED Editorial SacBee Lauding Williams CHairmans New Position Favoring Caps I got this from one of my Williams counterparts Daniel Weintraub An energy trader says its time to limit profits Published May In a sea of angry fingerpointing namecalling and ridicule Keith Bailey stands out as an island of calm a lonely voice of reason who understands that a companys longterm selfinterest is about more than how much money it can make today Most Californians probably have never heard of Bailey a Kansas City native and chief executive officer of Tulsabased Williams Cos a private energy trader that has profited handsomely from the states recent miseries But Golden Staters from Gov Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma resident He might be the man who saves our future Bailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary caps on the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might return to the Wests energy market His rationale is this To save Californias private electricity market new power plants are desperately needed But not enough of those plants will be built if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product they already are providing Californians though dont want to promise payment without knowing they will be able to afford the bill Shortterm caps on profits Bailey believes are the best way to ease the states fears get everybody paid and move on to a system that works for suppliers and customers One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create something that California can look at and say So long as prices are determined on this basis were prepared to pay Bailey said in an interview This is a mechanism that lets the state say Were not signing a blank check We dont know what the price is going to be but we do know how it will be determined Baileys proposal is different from the limited price caps approved last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and far better for California The federal caps would come with all sorts of strings attached would kick in only during emergencies and would be focused on prices not profits Bailey is proposing that all power sold from now through summer be priced at the cost of producing it plus a profit of percent Thats more than a regulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek and far less than electricity providers have been earning of late Cynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has squeezed all it can from California The firm reported last week that profits doubled in the first quarter of over a year ago with pretax income from its energy services nearly tripling to million Much of the megawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already committed in longterm contracts so Bailey has relatively little to lose if what remains can only be sold at controlled prices But here is at least one measure of Baileys sincerity His company still is owed million for electricity it has provided California And hes not insisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect or even as part of the deal Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with he said Whether that ultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the parties it will sort itself out one way or another Perhaps if we find prices that work going forward that could be used as a framework Bailey an engineer by training says no one should mistake his proposal for a lack of confidence in free markets He still firmly believes that a deregulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the West in the long term He just wants to make sure there is a long term Bailey is watching and listening to California He hears talk of seizing power plants of turning to a public power system He describes these ideas as Draconian and says they would not solve the problem But he also knows there is a limit to what Californians and their elected leaders can take I recognize we live in a democracy and lots of things could happen he said What he is proposing in effect is a safety valve He wants to limit the market in order to save it This is an extraordinary situation Bailey said We need to help create some breathing room We all have to work together and this is the right thing to do Baileys proposal made at a conference of energy producers and traders in Oklahoma last week was almost lost amid all the focus on the price caps approved in Washington But there is still time to give the idea the attention it deserves Properly nourished it could be the breakthrough that solves this crisis Davis and others in California should seize the moment Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax

Calpine Announce Plans to Develop New Natural Gas Pipeline To California Sonoran Accepts Binding Bid for Dekathermsday HOUSTON May PRNewswire Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP NYSE KMP news and national independent power company Calpine Corporation NYSE CPN news today announced plans to jointly develop the Sonoran Pipeline subject to a successful open season and all other approvals As proposed the Sonoran Pipeline will be a mile highpressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in California The project will provide much needed natural gas transportation capacity to California to serve rapidly growing electric generation demand In addition producers will be able to move more natural gas from the San Juan Basin through the Sonoran Pipeline This will benefit California consumers as access to these abundant natural gas supplies has been constrained due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure The interstate pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The first phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with the second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer of This exciting project will enable us to grow our core business and extend our natural gas transportation service into new markets said Richard D Kinder chairman and CEO of KMP We dont currently transport natural gas into California but we do own and operate the largest independent products pipeline on the West Coast headquartered in Orange Calif We will utilize our expertise as a major natural gas pipeline operator and transporter to build the Sonoran Pipeline and we look forward to expanding our relationship with Calpine one of the leading power plant developers in America According to Pete Cartwright chairman president and CEO of Calpine the project will serve several important purposes for Calpine The Sonoran Pipeline will help ensure a diverse supply of natural gas in California With our existing plants in California and our plans to bring on line an additional megawatts of capacity it is essential that we have a dependable competitively priced source of natural gas This important new pipeline will allow us to better control our costs in the California market to help lower energy prices and build needed generation This project is a great example of two energy companies joining forces and utilizing their complementary strengths to provide real solutions to Californias energy crisis The project is expected to be developed in two phases Phase One Phase One will consist of approximately miles of inch high pressure natural gas interstate pipeline originating from interconnects with TransColorado Gas Transmission Company Transwestern Pipeline Company and various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan County NM near the Colorado New Mexico state line thus providing access to the major producing basins in the western US The pipeline will continue westward with delivery points on the CaliforniaArizona border near Needles with a mile inch lateral to Topock The pipeline will initially transport up to dekatherms Dth of natural gas per day and can be economically expanded with compression to transport up to million Dth per day A binding open season will be held this month and potential shippers will be given the opportunity to commit to firm capacity on the new line Given sufficient shipper support in the open season Sonoran Pipeline LLC Sonoran proposes an inservice date in the summer of The estimated cost of phase one of the project is approximately million The open season will seek at a minimum year term commitments at a fixed transport rate of per Dth for firm transportation Sonoran proposes to charge shippers actual fuel on Phase One via a fuel tracker Fuel is estimated at percent Sonoran has already received an acceptable binding bid from Calpine Energy Services LP for Dth per day Phase Two Phase Two will be an extension of Phase One and consist of approximately miles of inch and inch highpressure interstate natural gas pipeline continuing from Needles on the California border to points within California terminating near Antioch in Contra Costa County Depending on shipper interest Phase Two will transport from to million Dth of natural gas per day A nonbinding open season will be held on Phase Two simultaneous with the Phase One open season and potential shippers will be given the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm capacity to California delivery points Sonoran has already received a nonbinding bid from Calpine Energy Services LP for Dth per day for Phase Two The estimated cost of Phase Two is approximately billion The pipeline could connect with several gas pipelines utilities and suppliers such as Kern River Mojave Elk Hills Pacific Gas and Electric Company Southern California Gas and numerous gasfired power plants including Calpines along its route Additionally Sonoran would consider other potential connections in accordance with shipper requests After finalizing precedent agreements in which shippers make binding contractual commitments to capacity on the line Sonoran Pipeline will

to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public Pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back To Freeman who has resigned as general manager of the LA Department of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov Gray Davis it seems Riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer California out of the energy crisis So the mayor Freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment With all due respect I have years of experience and knowledgeand he has days Freeman said But hes the mayor and he didnt like it that I didnt just say yes to everything he came up with To Riordan Freemans efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles The mayor said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis And he scoffed at Freeman for saying he had lifted morale at DWP Morale was terrible under him Riordan said I mean they are so relieved right now The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud successful men unable to say I couldnt have done it without X Y and Z Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings And the mayor a Republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with Freeman a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Southern drawl In an interview after his resignation Freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor One of his concerns Freeman said was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agencys progress in protecting the environment Freeman cited Riordans plans concerning coalfired power plants in Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP the nations largest municipal utility The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the Grand Canyon The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale He described the mayors move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees DWP were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the West Ive worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the DWP policy Freeman said And I am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress weve made The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central Utah Riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause In both cases Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los Angeles at an affordable cost By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and expanding the Utah plant Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow Riordan said Natural gas which provides of the fuel for DWP plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides The rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power providers I favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where were going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles Riordan said On the Mohave plant Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the citys share to a buyer that would simply continue running it Its still going to be coaldriven he said How does selling it help the environment The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how LA has dodged the crisis Riordan and the DWP commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches Freeman said The conflict reached its peak on April the day Freeman resigned to become the governors advisor The DWP board president Kenneth T Lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately All we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us Lombard said From Riordans standpoint Freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest The city utility sells surplus power to the state so Freeman would be on both sides of the sales Freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees In an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what Ive accomplished here he said Brian DArcy who heads the union local that represents DWP employees agreed that Riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky DArcy said Riordan said Freeman deserves an Aplus for his work at DWP The mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done to hurt Los Angeles But he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP not just by the mayor but by the agencys board

Council NERC released its Summer Assessment today The assessment concludes that California will experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this summer said Michehl R Gent NERC President and CEO and California electricity users will experience rotating blackouts much more so than last summer or this winter The report also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere For your convenience a copy of the press release announcing the Summer Assessment is shown below In addition this press release as well as the subject reports are available from the NERC web site wwwnerccom If you have any questions let me know Sincerely Julie Morgan Contacts Ellen P Vancko or Eugene F Gorzelnik May NERC Releases its Summer Reliability Assessment The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC released its Summer Assessment today The assessment concludes that California will experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this summer said Michehl R Gent NERC President and CEO and California electricity users will experience rotating blackouts much more so than last summer or this winter The report also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere In addition the report cautions that New England New York City and Texas should be closely watched despite having adequate resources to meet demand New England and New York City are particularly sensitive to longterm heat waves and higherthanexpected generating unit forced outages Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area operations into one The report concludes that generating capacity resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in other areas of North America this summer The assessment also points to concerns regarding northtosouth transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United States particularly east of the Mississippi River The ability to transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern Interconnection was severely tested last summer spurred by cool temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south as well as high fuel prices in the south Early indications are that key transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south are already fully subscribed going into this summer and that transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout the summer As a supplement to its Summer Assessment report NERC also published a Summer Special Assessment This document is an indepth independent examination of the expected summer conditions in both California and the Pacific Northwest and is based on interviews with experts from both the California Independent System Operator CAISO and the Northwest Power Pool NWPP NERCs CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC the CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand rotating blackouts are expected NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater than those expected by the CAISO NERC anticipates that firm demand may be curtailed for about hours over the course of this summer with an average firm demand curtailment of about MW NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to serve all their firm electricity demands this summer However NWPP will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst water years on record The independent reports prepared by NERCs Reliability Assessment Subcommittee assess the projected demand and the resources available to meet that demand this summer as well as transmission reliability issues The reports are posted on NERCs web site at wwwnerccom The web site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into NAERO and the electric industrys electricity supply and delivery programs and activities NERC is a notforprofit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to keep the lights on by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States Canada and a portion of Baja California Norte Mexico

the body of this email Once we circulate a draft and get a version people are comfortable with Id recommend the following actions but not by Enron send the letter to the governor and all members of the Legislature run the letter as a fullpage ad in key newspapers advance the story to the media for earned coverage possible editorial boards w several CEOs not Enron We could have an effort in both Northern and Southern California w different CEOs to emphasize the bipartisanship and diversity of support for the solution This media effort should target broadcast as well Edit away An open letter to Governor Davis and members of the Legislature Californias energy crisis has persisted and worsened over the past months We have already experienced blackouts and with summer fast approaching unless something is done immediately the worst is yet to come The North American Electric Reliability Council released a report last week that said California is expected to experience more than hours of blackouts this summer thats ten days without power Californias economy cannot afford to grind to a halt because we have no power Two of the states largest companies have been thrown into financial turmoil Pacific Gas Electric has already declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison is on the brink With California spending more than a day on power and depleting cash reserves the States credit rating has been downgraded only Louisiana has a lower rating While there has been much talk of potential solutions none have advanced There is too much at risk to delay another day Therefore we the undersigned are proposing a comprehensive fivestep solution to solve Californias short and longterm energy crisis that includes the following Decrease demand There is no time to build power plants or get additional generation online in time for this summer Therefore the only option to reduce the impact of an electricity shortage this summer is to reduce consumption This can be accomplished in several ways Realtime pricing prices should reflect the cost of producing electricity which varies throughout the day When demand is at a peak prices are high when demand drops so do prices This will give customers a financial incentive to conserve and take simple actions like turning the thermostat up two degrees Demand buydown programs If a customer is willing to pay for kilowatts used heshe ought to be compensated for kilowatts saved NEED TO SAY WHO WILL PAY FOR THIS Increase supply The Governor has taken an important first step by using his executive powers to streamline power plant siting While the state currently has approved power plants totaling megawatts its not enough California ought to be the most attractive place to build power plants transmission lines and pipelines instead its the least There is a backlog of turbines for power plant development yet of the backlogged only are earmarked for California because the state has sent an anywhere but here message to investors The states political leaders must reject action that discourages investment including Legislation that would impose a windfall profits tax on power sold in California and make it a felony to sell power at a price that the state finds unreasonable Continued calls for price caps in wholesale power market caps only create shortages and fail to reduce prices Investigations into allegations that suppliers manipulated power prices Make the utilities creditworthy Under California law utilities are forced to charge frozen rates but they must buy power at higher wholesale prices The utilities inability to recover their costs has forced PGE into bankruptcy and threatens Southern California Edisons solvency The solution to restoring the utilities creditworthiness is to set rates that cover the utilities past debts and future costs and then give customers the power to reduce their bills by conserving or by choosing a competitive energy supplier Get California out of the powerbuying business Once rate increases return the utilities to creditworthiness the role of buying power can be returned to the utility very quickly within three to six months The state should not buy the transmission grid to raise additional cash for the utilities There are other ways to raise funds for example a miniscule rate increase of twotenths of one cent per kilowatt hour could accomplish the same thing and keep the power expertise in the hands of the utilities Get deregulation right in California California never deregulated In fact today there is more regulation than ever before For true deregulation to exist every consumer and business in the state must have the right to hire and fire their energy service provider When California passed a law this year authorizing the state to buy power that same law ABX called for an end to customer choice also called direct access California must rescind ABX and reinstate the right of customers to choose their energy service provider ARE WE INCLUDING CORENONCORE i cant remember We urge the Legislature and Governor to enact legislation that includes these five components and sets California on the path to economic stability The longer the delay the bigger the problem The time to act is now CEO CEO etc

Californiansthe only people who knew who we invited to the meeting but did not attend were Dick Riordan and Kevin Sharer Saturday May SF Chronicle Enrons secret bid to save deregulationPRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Energy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp quietly courted Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to Californias energy crisis His prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and federal investigations and less rather than more regulation Lay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign contributors hosted a private minute meeting in a conference room at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday Among the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star Schwarzenegger and Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates One participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support Lays vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the states energy mess PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by either reregulating the system or creating a government authority to provide electricity Gov Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in California Theyre trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron executives They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea At the meeting Enron representatives circulated a fourpage position paper titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The Chronicle It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in debt incurred by the states public utilities and that investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power generators and traders a possibility given credibility in studies by regulators and economists One of the talking points read Get deregulation right this time California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a competitive power market system Lay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially produces nothing but makes money as a middleman buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased percent to billion Asked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment One participant said Denne was present at the meeting DC CONNECTIONS Meanwhile Lays power in Washington is reported to have reached unprecedented heights According to a story in yesterdays New York Times Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them The story also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lays desire to further deregulate the nations electricity system Lay denied the allegation Also in attendance at this weeks meeting were Bruce Karatz chief executive of home builder Kaufman Broad Ray Irani chief executive of Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant Amgen Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the worlds first civilian space trip Milken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but declined to be interviewed Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon A spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor attended but was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this issue His intent is to listen to all sides Attached to the Enron handout was a twopage open letter addressed to Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support Lays position and would be willing to sign their names to it The source who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda Email the writers at and Scott Winokur

Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy Services Relevance Score on Scale of

JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones An investigation by Californias attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity persons familiar with the probe said Monday The sources including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer said generators arent likely to be prosecuted even though it appears they did withhold supply and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal one PUC commissioner said California Gov Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night spokesman Steve Maviglio said Maviglio refused to disclose details of the attorney generals briefing but said the investigation was ongoing We have not called off the dogs Maviglio said Were still pressing the attorney general to pursue the investigation The governor who has repeatedly blamed the states yearlong power crisis on market manipulation by generators is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to take legal action against generators but that claim was premature another PUC commissioner said The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and earlier this year but after dozens of interviews with economists traders and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal behavior We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace thats documented one of the commissioners said The question is whether thats illegal and I dont think it is The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices the other commissioner said because it passed a flawed deregulation bill The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers in the best interest of their shareholders to do exactly what they have done the commissioner said Unless theyre talking with each other and there is evidence of absolute colluding were not going to get to first base The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke Energy DUK Dynegy Inc DYN Mirant Corp MIR Williams Cos WMB Reliant Energy Inc REI and others but that too is going to be difficult How do you sue someone for being unethical the person in Lockyers office said A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldnt comment but said the probe is ongoing Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldnt comment on the investigation but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC The generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully Severin Borenstein director of the University of California at Berkeley Energy Institute said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust behavior Borenstein said Prosecuting generators is a longshot he said They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys were in the same room Phil Verlager an economist specializing in energy issues said generators didnt even act unethically because the setup of Californias deregulation law allowed generators to get away with withholding power Even if no smoking gun has been found tough talk by PUC President Lynch scared the suppliers the commissioner said They got the message that they ought to play the game Lynch didnt return calls for comment Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento The

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California investigations have turned up a growing body of evidence that may allow the states attorney general to pursue criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power prices in the state the office of California Gov Gray Davis said Tuesday The governors office didnt detail that evidence however and persons familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence exists The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of civil and criminal actions Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a short written statement There is a growing body of evidence that may give the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by generators operating in the states wholesale electricity market Maviglio didnt disclose further details of the investigation Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld but hasnt been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal There is no evidence of criminal behavior one said It just doesnt exist S David Freeman senior energy adviser to Davis acknowledged the distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington DC about allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices It may not be criminal conduct but its a crime he said Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators because theres likely no smoking gun Any claim that the investigation hasnt turned up evidence of criminal activity is an overstatement Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said The investigation is ongoing she said Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent sharp decline in power prices in the West An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to prosecuting the energy companies so they will continue to play the game The governor who has repeatedly blamed the states yearlong power crisis on market manipulation by generators is pressing federal

utilities and avoid helping state foot the bill June By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Californias business community is locked in a battle with energy regulators and lawmakers about how deregulation will ultimately pan out and whether companies will be stuck paying most of the tab for the states electricity crisis Business groups want to continue down the road toward deregulation They are lobbying politicians to pass legislation that would let companies buy electricity directly from power suppliers bypassing the states regulated utilities In our hearts we still believe we can make this a competitive market and get some cost savings said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association which represents stores in the state including Home Depot Target and Albertsons But Gov Gray Davis foray into longterm contracts agreeing to pay billion over to years for power could squash that ambition The states Public Utilities Commission delayed a proposal June to restrict companies from signing socalled direct access contracts with power providers Regulators are expected to rule on the proposal next week The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve Californias costly power crisis It will determine whether businesses with residential customers pay for the bulk of the states future energy purchases It also could determine whether Southern California Edison the states cashstrapped No utility will avoid bankruptcy and whether deregulation will survive in any form The governor got it exactly wrong said Peter Navarro an economics professor at the University of California Irvine who is running for the San Diego City Council The longterm contract strategy is a de facto reregulation of the market because it eliminates the ability of industrial customers to bargain for a lower price Direct access was a key component of the deregulation law designed to break the monopoly of Californias utilities Under this concept all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility just as they pick a longdistance phone company Currently businesses and government entities have direct access as well as about residential customers but some energy service providers such as Enron Corp are dropping their residential customers Direct access is at the center of the latest Edison bailout plan sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Under the plan the largest businesses would agree to pay billion of Edisons debts over years In exchange businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by But energy regulators may not let companies off the hook at such a bargain price David Gamson an energy adviser to PUC Commissioner Geoffrey F Brown said regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system the state will be stuck with too much electricity under longterm electricity contracts through That would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the billion in future power costs Complicating the issue is Wall Street The states bankers led by JP Morgan are nervous about selling as much as billion in planned state bonds if businesses now the largest ratepayers in the state after governments find a way out of the system The bonds are meant to repay the state for billion in powerbuying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs Business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills If businesses are allowed to sign on with outside energy providers that revenue stream would be in jeopardy We have companies now that want to get belowcost power from the state but when the market turns they want to leave said Lawrence Lingbloom chief policy adviser on energy to Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey Remaining customers would be left with those costs and it would create a death spiral for the revenue stream Consumer groups oppose direct access because it would allow businesses to avoid paying most of the costs of the energy crisis Direct access is a policy that should be dead because its a key adjunct to deregulation said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica But right now its a policy thats driving all the deals Even as regulators and consumer groups try to snuff out direct access business groups are lobbying to save it with the help of key legislators Two bills one sponsored by Bowen who heads the Senate energy committee and a second by Assemblyman Dave Kelley RHemet would rescind language in previous legislation that gave the Public Utilities Commission authority to block direct access Both proposals would require businesses to pay the state an exit fee Those fees havent yet been determined but they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases Companies say they dont want to pay Direct access has allowed businesses to enter fixed price contracts to get stable rates said Shawn Covell senior manager for governmental affairs at Qualcomm Inc in San Diego Its really unfair when you have businesses that have taken their time to protect themselves to punish them Qualcomm which makes telecommunications equipment saw its energy bills double to million last year The company signed a contract with an energy service provider Strategic Energy in Carlsbad and capped its rates Otherwise Covell said its electricity costs would have doubled again this year Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista is a directaccess customer The district with students spends about million a year on energy said Jim Clark its energy manager His district won a watchdog award for efficiency from the San Diego County Taxpayers Association because it locked in lower rates When Gov Gray Davis announced in January that the state would begin signing longterm contracts Clark extended the districts contract through at cents per kilowatthour enabling it to save million a year he said As soon as Davis made the announcement we knew the market was going to move he said The market only changes when people buy When the state of California steps to the plate the price goes to the moon Davis has maintained that the longterm contracts between the state and power suppliers helped bring down high spot market prices in recent weeks by removing demand from that market But Clark and others who want to go the directaccess route fear the government will force businesses to pay for all the costs of the energy crisis including rate increases of percent to percent plus surcharges to pay off billion in forthcoming state bonds Businesses will be required to pay for the mistakes that the governor and the Legislature have made he said Who else is going to pay for it Ultimately it will fall on the heads of all consumers Register staff writer Hanh Kim Quach contributed

Bustamonte Gary I just sent this to your other email address The Lt Gov was in on this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings so this may come up The credibility of these former SDGE employees was very weak in the hearing and their allegations are absurd To California news media covering electricity crisis As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas Electric employees we have been in the news a bit lately To add a bit of clarity to the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through each of the three claims and our response To more fully understand the situation please read the attached story that appeared in the LA Times yesterday These reporters had the logs that were stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks ago We went through these log books line by line with these reporters They also obtained confidential information from the CalISO during these three days January that indicated that we were operating at their instruction when ramping up an down the units This is because the ISO purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the states supply and demand is in balance This is a common practice and done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide this service Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when they were made formally in Senator Dunns committee hearing Friday although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone I understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDGE employees tomorrow We had tried to personally meet with the governor last summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and megawatts of peaking plants in and and were not able to Tom Williams Director of Public Affairs Duke Energy North America Morro Bay CA Los Angeles Times via Dow Jones Publication Date Saturday June Page B Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By DOUG SMITH CARL INGRAM and RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS SACRAMENTO Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused officials of Duke Energy Co of manipulating Californias crippled electricity market for higher profits but records and interviews show that the company was responding partly to state instructions Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistleblower allegations which called them baseless The former employees at Dukes South Bay facility told a legislative committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up and down like a yoyo in an apparent gambit to drive up profits In support of the allegations the workers produced logs showing Dukes trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power emergencies over three days in midJanuary Duke officials who will testify in the weeks ahead said the up and down throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state which had paid the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System Operator Moreover CalISO which in the past has accused power firms of withholding electricity to boost prices stressed Friday that it regularly directs generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside CalISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Its energy that can be called upon instantly to meet a fluctuation in demand or within minutes or within an hour Certainly we call on standby services regularly to meet these fluctuations The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more than years first for San Diego Gas Electric and later under contract for Duke They were let go by Duke in April Former power plant mechanics Ed G Edwards Jr and Glenn D Johnson accused Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation capacity beginning in leaving workers puzzled Managers brushed aside questions about the activity saying they were for economic reasons the workers said Sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days Sometimes it would be down for two or three hours It didnt make sense Johnson said He said the phrase appeared to be another way to explain limiting the load or curtailing the load to boost prices Instead of running two units to make the same price Johnson said you could run one unit and make three times the price Some energy experts argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in Californias tight electricity market The third worker Jimmy Olkjer an assistant control room operator said such actions began after Duke began operating the plant Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman asked Olkjer whether SDGE operated in the same manner No he said Edwards one of the exmechanics said prolonged repairs by Duke were part of the apparent gaming of the power market Once he was directed to throw away pallets of power plant parts he said Some of it was brand new stuff in its original packaging I used a forklift took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets Edwards said He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part which in the past would have been readily available Duke officials bragged about their moneymaking ways Edwards said At employee parties after the first year of operation Duke executives boasted that they made more money than they had expected in five years Dunn and Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey a committee member said later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers testimony but that it did not constitute a smoking gun Both said they would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators Duke officials who will testify before the committee next month said CalISO controlled much of the ramping activity Our employees followed the directions of the grid operator said Bill Hall who oversees Dukes plant operations in the West Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the plants inventory system said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman Duke has decreased outages and significantly increased its production since purchasing the plant he said The proofs in the numbers he said One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the previous owner SDGE as well as by Duke CalISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities with Duke But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and standby power at the plant That electricity can be ordered on and off the system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid In the January period focused on at Fridays hearing records show that three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver standby power The fourth unit was shut for servicing On Jan for example records show that the agency called on one unit to increase output by megawatts at am and reduce it by that same amount two hours later Then at noon the agency ordered more megawatts cutting it back to at pm By days end the agency had asked for an additional megawatts A second unit was instructed to add or more megawatts four times on the same day A third unit was ramped up or down times bouncing from zero to as high as megawatts The records show only power that ISO actually needed The agency refused to disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had not called on But after reviewing records for the midJanuary period CalISO manager of markets Brian Rahman said The most viable reason why any one unit would not have been producing would have been for operating reserve Here is a link to the release below californiareleasesnrasp DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO June SACRAMENTO Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator ISO to track fluctuations in electricity demand and the plant operated at top reliability The company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energys own direction The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas Electric SDGE who were not hired as part of the new operating team when Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April Bill Hall vice president of Duke Energys western operations said These allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated by people who dont know the full story Hall reviewed the charges and the facts Charge Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices during times when energy supplies were short The facts The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to meet system reliability and Duke Energys contractual commitments While the three exworkers allude to log books from the plant control room with notations from Duke Energy Trading Marketing DETM the former SDGE South Bay employees apparently did not know that that the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator Our records of ISO directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations Charge The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO prices The facts South Bays megawatt jetfueled unit was designed principally to provide startup power to the stations steam units This unit has been made available to provide as much energy as possible to California during the states energy crisis During the period in question the jetfueled unit was being operated because the price of jet fuel was substantially less than the cost of natural gas This resulted in lower marginal costs The megawatt unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energys California contractual commitments This electricity was not being bid into the ISO market so there was no way it could have influenced ISO market prices Charge Inventory management including throwing out spare parts at South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs The facts At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable for service The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard industry practices Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for South Bay when we assumed operations for the plant in We retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of inventory that was damaged or obsolete Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our power plants

Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday

JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February American Electric Power Service Corp AEP million Arizona Public Service Co PNW million

ANGELESBUSINESS WIREJuly via NewsEdge Corporation Neutrogena Corporation a Johnson amp Johnson company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced today the completion of a kilowatt million solar power system at the companys headquarters located near LAX The system was made possible through the LADWP Solar Incentive Program that substantially lowers the purchase price of such systems for the municipally owned utilitys customers The solar system covers square feet of roof area and will help reduce the companys energy consumption by approximately percent monthly This is the type of leadership the people of California need from the corporate sector to successfully meet the energy consumption demands in the State said Dr Woodrow Clark senior policy analyst energy and reliability for California Governor Gray Davis I commend the LADWP for their promotion of solar energy and strongly encourage other companies to follow Neutrogenas lead in using solar power Neutrogena received a million Solar Incentive or rebate from LADWP Its system utilizes Siemens Solar panels and was designed and installed by the PowerLight Corporation This new solar power system is an example of the innovative ways the City and local businesses are working together to conserve energy said Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn Using solar power will lead to a cleaner environment in Los Angeles and I urge other corporations to follow suit This is truly remarkable a single company has installed a solar system that provides power equivalent to that used by average size Los Angeles homes And by doing so it frees up that energy for use elsewhere At a time when every kilowatt counts this is a major breakthrough said Ruth Galanter chair of the Los Angeles City Councils Commerce Energy and Natural Resources Committee Neutrogena headquarters is located in Councilmember Galanters district Being a good corporate citizen is very important to Neutrogena and Johnson amp Johnson said Michael McNamara president of Neutrogena Corporation and this is a very tangible representation of our commitment to bettering the cities where we work and live And were grateful to the LADWP who brought this program to our attention and assisted us every step of the way According to Angelina Galiteva LADWP Director of Strategic Planning The Neutrogena system will eliminate more than pounds of carbon dioxide CO annually which is the equivalent of taking automobiles off Los Angeles streets We can all breathe a little easier thanks to LADWP customers such as Neutrogena Through its Solar Power Program LADWP offers its residential and commercial customers an Incentive payment or rebate of or per watt for solar electric systems in order to make these systems more affordable To date LADWP has received Solar

Wednesday July PM To Shapiro Richard Steffes James Mara Susan Kingerski Harry Lawner Leslie Tribolet Michael Walsh Kristin Denne Karen Guerrero Janel Kaufman Paul Landwehr Sue M Robertson Linda Subject CAISO cuts refund estimate to B from B Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To B From B Updated Wednesday July AM ET By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to billion from billion when an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was taken into account according to data submitted to FERC last week The California Independent System Operators estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview and its estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the judge following the conclusion of days of talks between power suppliers and the state over potential refunds last week Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate however the state is sticking to the original billion figure which has been called arbitrary by critics The billion estimate merely establishes a potential framework for settlement discussions Eric Hildebrandt the ISOs chief analyst on the matter told the FERC FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner who has dismissed the billion figure as baseless and criticized Californias delegation for not negotiating in good faith estimated in his report on the talks that refunds due may amount to about billion Power suppliers offered just over million Wagner has recommended FERC hold a day hearing to set the level of refunds and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed The ISOs original billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didnt go through the ISOs wholesale markets the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases the ISO made estimates We know the volume of the bilateral deals Hildebrandt said The refund amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market Resetting The Baseline Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the ISO and CalPX markets which were set up by the states deregulation law for Californias three investorowned utilities to purchase power in addition to sales to the California Department of Water Resources The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX news msgs unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January DWR has also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy SRE news msgs unit San Diego Gas Electric Co In arriving at his new estimate the ISOs Hildebrandt also recalculated fair prices the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined by retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator needed to meet demand each hour But last week after Hildebrandt completed his billion estimate Wagner recommended to FERC commissioners that the June price control formula be modified when used retroactively to determine refunds Those modifications if applied to the ISOs estimate would cut refunds much further For example FERCs price limits are now based on a monthly average of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state Wagner recommended using power producers actual gas costs Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California using actual prices would cut potential refunds sharply Also Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about onethird according to Hildebrandts previous monthly breakdown ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagners recommendations but the ISO will still include sales back to May said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle The reason were not going back just to Oct is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid McCorkle said We just maintain that position FERC Baseline Questioned In addition Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERCs new formula the price cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have been available not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand Thats because the FERCs new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time Hildebrandt said Applying that rule would raise the ISOs revised estimate substantially to billion from billion One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher Hildebrandt said was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units Considering only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the rewards for such withholding he said The judge is in error to suggest that the actual leastefficient unit used would have been called on if the mustoffer requirement were in effect Hildebrandt said in an interview In arriving at his estimate Hildebrandt determined the difference between actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and for every hour since May had price controls been in effect The ISO released only the total potential refund not the companyspecific shares Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his numbers arent justified These are based on very tangible records he said The idea that its a black box is misleading By Mark Golden Dow Jones

lowered their forecasts for the largest energy trader Enron said July that it expects to make a share this year and in We will hit those numbers and we will beat those numbers Skilling told a meeting of analysts and investors in New York Enron shares have fallen about percent since it made the profit forecasts Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who downgraded US energy companies because of falling prices for power and natural gas Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by Enron customers in California and India and losses by Enrons broadband trading unit which may hurt Enrons profits All of these are bunk Skilling said These are not issues for this stock The shares of Enron fell cents to in early afternoon trading today Enron makes much of its money from profits from arranging trades of power gas oil and other commodities Skilling said It returns are based more on the volume of trades and energy contracts than on the prices of the commodities themselves he said The growth of our sales is not driven by the economy Skilling said Its driven by the growth of markets The refusal of a state government in India to pay million in power bills is not going to hurt Enrons earnings Skilling said In India we have government guarantees on the performance of our contract Skilling said Were convinced well be paid in full for the million the company has invested so far plus unpaid power bills Enron owns percent of Dabhol Power Co which invested about billion in a power plant in India In California Enron is owed more than the states power grid manager has accused the company of overcharging Skilling said California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and generators after power prices soared in the state leaving its two largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy electricity for their customers The state has threatened to sue if power sellers dont agree to billion in refunds Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a meltdown in broadband communications Skilling said The companys plan to trade space on fiberoptic telecommunications network helped its stock rise percent last year The stock has plunged percent this year as the collapse of Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December Houstonbased Enron is selling more power in Europe and more energymanagement contracts to smaller commercial customers in the US company executives said Energy management contracts are agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their energy consumption Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration proposal to expand competition for wholesale power Skilling said USA Enron says would not pay California refund By Timothy Gardner Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK July Reuters Energy firm Enron Corp would not pay its minuscule portion of the nearly billion California claims energy companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid to last spring Governor Gray Davis a Democrat said he is prepared to go to court to retrieve the money But Enron the No US natural gas and electricity marketer does not intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges which Skilling said was minuscule The billion number is bogus to begin with Skilling told analysts at a meeting about Enrons secondquarter earnings in New York Skilling said Enrons share of the alleged overcharge is million He said Enron should in fact recover million in net purchases from California At least one sector of Californias electricity regulation system agrees that Enrons involvement was small in the power crisis in which electricity prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states power grid show Enron accounted for percent of the alleged billion overcharge The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its biweekly commissioners meeting in part to consider the refunds after a federal mediator rejected Californias claims On July FERC Chief Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for further action Wednesdays meeting is the last scheduled before the commission takes a monthlong break STILL ROUNDS TO BE FOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA Enrons problems in California are far from being settled A committee of the California Senate investigating suspected price gouging during the power crunch recently found Enron in contempt for refusing to disclose confidential sales and bidding records The California Senate last used the contempt ruling in against a cement company but eventually the states Supreme Court threw out the ruling saying the charges were too vague Just before the California Senate voted to hold Enron in contempt the Houstonbased company sued in a California court on a claim that FERC not the California Senate had jurisdiction They California are making political noise we dont like said Skilling He said if the situation got worse the company could reduce its market share there Well walk away from the situation and reserve out he said Although Enron claims little involvement in the alleged overcharge the company says it has learned from the crisis Skilling said that looking forward Enron will avoid dealing with intermediaries that the company contends helped lead to the power crunch Were focused on retail in California were going direct to customers without dealing with an intermediary said Skilling Shares in Enron which reported earnings slightly better than expected on July were down cents to in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange That is down from its peak this year of more than hit in midFebruary in the depths of the Western power crunch Timothy Gardner New York Energy Desk fax Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Price Gouging Beyond FERCs Reach ISO By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February American Electric Power Service Corp AEP million Arizona Public Service Co PNW million Aquila Power Corp ILA million Avista Energy Inc AVA million Automated Power Exchange million British Columbia Power Exchange Corp million Calpine

panel sounds like it had quite a few testy exchanges Calif Officials Tell FERC To Face Political Reality Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc By Bryan Lee OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow JonesThe political uproar generated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions decision that it had no legal authority to order refunds in Californias highflying power market washed up on the agencys doorstep Thursday Californias governor and other government leaders banded together to criticize FERC at a public meeting Thursday one week after FERC issued an order proposing market reforms for California California Gov Gray Davis delivered a stinging rebuke of the commission via videotape as state legislators testified that FERC must act quickly or the states voters may take things into their own hands with a ballot initiative Davis summed up the discontent by noting that FERC had concluded that prices in Californias firstinthenation deregulated electricity market were neither just nor reasonable but you are not willing to do anything about it Instead Davis said FERC is asking the state to knuckle under to high prices for the next few years while the economy suffers I cannot allow you to do that Davis said without elaborating on what recourse he intends to take Other state officials in a giveandtake that at times bordered on acrimony insisted FERC was wrong in interpreting the Federal Power Act as limiting the commissions authority to order refunds State Sen Debra Bowen who chairs the utility committee called for FERC to recognize the political reality within the state of its decision not to order refunds or to firmly regulate prices until the power crisis is abated We will have a political revolt on our hands Bowen warned once all the states retail consumers and not just those in San Diego are exposed to the markets uncontained price volatility in the near future Congress never repealed FERCs mandate under the power act to assure that prices are just and reasonable said state Sen Steve Peace who warned that the commissions credibility was at stake in not ordering refunds FERC clearly has the authority to order refunds retroactively and the courts will support such an interpretation Peace argued San Diego Board of Supervisors Chairman Diane Jacob accused the states unregulated power providers of white collar crime San Diego County which has privatized its trash collection and telecommunications assets has voted to pursue forming a municipal utility to get out from under the yoke of the FERCregulated market Jacob said Jacob called on FERC to reconsider the scope of its authority to order refunds Your grant of marketbased rate authority rested on the premise that was adequate to assure just and reasonable rates she said Peace predicted that unless FERC takes stronger action California voters will pass a ballot initiative to condemn the states electricity system and make it government owned Well build the damn power plants if we have to Peace said This is going to end up in a lawsuit no matter what you do Peace said urging the commission to be sued by power providers rather than state consumers Were playing by the rules said William Hall asset management vice president for Duke Energy North Americas Western region DUK Were not doing anything wrong and were confident we cant be ordered to provide refunds Hall said The state officials rejected arguments against price caps and reregulation of the market voiced earlier in the day by power marketers and generators who warned that price controls will only worsen the states power supply problems by serving as a disincentive for investment in new power plants New generation is coming on line in California despite existing price caps the state officials said Five power plants are set to go on line next year and another three are in the pipeline for said William Keese California Energy Commission chairman Plenty of people are not being chased away who will build supply said Michael Kahn chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board There is a very long line of those willing to step into the place of Enron said Peace referring to the companys testimony earlier that it scuttled plans to build megawatts of peaking power in the state because of price uncertainty Supply is being addressed Whats not being addressed is pricing said Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utility Commission The session threatened to become acrimonious as Peace repeatedly directed verbal jabs at FERC Commissioner Curtis Hebert Jr the lone Republican among the four sitting commissioners and an ardent opponent of price controls and market intervention The governors critical taped remarks ended with a pointed barb that FERCs marketrestructuring order last week undermined the states authority but apart from that I think youre a fine group of people Peace then retorted to Hebert I dont think he included you in his comment Hebert stood his ground and fired back at Peace I understand your emotions therefore I dont take offense at your shots at me Hebert said I didnt set up the infrastructure of Californias power market There are people in this room who did he said alluding to Peace You want us to intervene as you see fit not as we see fit You quite frankly made some decisions that got the state of California into trouble Hebert rejoined Bowen urged FERC to think of itself as the Alan Greenspan of Californias power market and temper irrational exuberance I agree that Alan Greenspan is the guy I dont think youd like what hed tell you to do countered Hebert Our job isnt to populistically say things that will inflame the people of California Our job is to set markets Hebert said FERC Chairman James Hoecker closed the session with remarks illustrating his skepticism regarding the call for regulating prices and ordering refunds until the market can be corrected Im not sure how we get there Hoecker said Im not sure we have the option of going backward in order to go forward without getting run over Hoecker said By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Sincerely Gary S Fergus This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may

Transcript Street Signs Date November Time PM PM Station CNBC Location Network Program Street Signs Maria Bartiromo anchor Well there have been few winners over the past few weeks on Wall Street even some of the energy and utility companies which were seen as safe havens in the market selloff have been hit hard this week Enron is one example Down fifteen percent in a week alone Take a look at this chart over the last couple of days And we see Enron down today by nine percent And it has begun falling Since Tuesday or so its been going down Graphic Enron Corp ENE down week stock chart Joining us now to discuss this company and the sector is Jeff Skilling Enrons president Mr Skilling good to have you with us Jeffrey Skilling President Enron Well thank you for inviting me on on such a positive uplifting day Maria Bartiromo Maybe you can make it a little more positive and uplifting for us Hows business Skilling Business is great If you look at our key energy businesses our wholesale and retail energy business yeartodate our volumeswhich really dictates our profitability in our wholesale businessare up about sixty percent versus last year In our retail energy business were up a hundred percent in contracting You know weve said earnings were on track for the fourth quarter at thirtyfive cents which is a twentypercent yearoveryear gain in net income Graphic Enron Corp ENE down year stock chart So business is great Bartiromo So you think Wall Street has it wrong Whats wrong with the stock over the last week or so Skilling Well you know I thinkmy own opinion on this is that youyou have a lot of people that are just uncomfortable with the general environment you know the presidential election people are starting to get concerned about how slowdown in growth of the economy willwill impact certain companies But I think you have a bunch of portfolio managers with their hair on fire running around And you know its kind of ready fire aim Bartiromo Right Skilling But I think as time goes on and people see the fundamentals particularly of our business and where we stand in the industry and growth prospects for the future you know Im convinced its goingits going to bounce right back Bartiromo And part of your business of course is trading Your Enron online one year this week is that right Skilling One year this week And its been a huge success Were up to over two hundred fifty billion dollarsbillion dollars in transactions Its the largestWebbased transaction site in the world In fact yesterday we did over four billion dollarsyesterday alone So you know we made a tremendous transition into the newnew Internetbased business Its had a big impact on our growth rate which has been very positive Soand Bartiromo Right Skilling then the stocks down So what do you do Bartiromo Soso youre basically making money regardless of the price of oil because youreyoure trading it Skilling Yeah Bartiromo It doesnt really matter if oil prices are high or low in your opinion Skilling Well ifif you really get down to what we sell customers wouwhat our customers are buying from Enron is reliable delivery and predictable prices And when you have this kind of volatility in the energy markets that you see particularly in places like California thats what people want to buy I mean you know the prospects for our business have never been better Bartiromo Well let me ask you a question I mean how is that been any different than an investment bank I mean you take a look at your pricetoearnings ratio versus some of the investment banks and the investment banks have been coming down quite significantly over the last six months or so because of that trading that they do Now your company is doing trading Sure its not trading stocks but would you compare yourself to an investment bank Skilling No You know itsits totally different Ifif you think of what we dowhat we do is we put together packages you know wewe take components of different energy pieces We put them together in packages for our customers Now trading is a piece of that because you have to have access to the markets for certain of those components sic But where we really create value for our customers is we put together a total energy solution for them Itsitsits more like I think the analogy is better that were like Toyota versus General Motors You know if you look at the Exxons and Shells big vertically integrated companies we do it much more flexibly lower costs than they do And thats why weve grown so much You know ourover the last ten years our wholesale business which we really started ten years ago has grown at a compound rate of forty percent a year since then I mean thatconsistently year in and year out Its a better business model And thats whats driving ourthats whats driving our growth and driving our profitability Bartiromo What do you make of whats going on Washington these days Theres been a lot of speculation that your CEO Kenneth Lay may join the Bush campaign if in fact Mr Bush is our next president Is that true And whats your comments on whats going on right now Skilling Well I justI was just talking to Kenny a couple of minutes ago andand what Ken said is that he has no intention of doing that at this point And you know who knows what theyll askor who knows who the next presidents going to be you know What Ive said to him You ought to do some sort of a deal They ought to flip a coin for the president If it comes down on the middle theyll make him president andand that would be wonderful for everybody Bartiromo Jeff how has this economic slowdown impacted your company Skilling It wont impact us at all Maria Itits kind of interesting because we compete in the nonregulated portion of the energy markets and broadband markets But unregulated portion of the energy markets So even though overall energy is growing relatively slowly the portion thats deregulatingor that is deregulated is growing by leaps and bounds If you take thethe overall energy market in Europe North America and Japan only about twenty percent of that market has deregulated That will be a hundred percent in five years So we should grow just hanging on to current market share And were growing on market share But if we just hang on to our existing market share we should grow by a factor of five just in the energy markets And just to remind you our sales last quarter were thirty billion dollars So were a hundred and thirtya hundredandtwentybilliondollarayear sales clip company Weve got builtin growth of five times over the next five to ten years regardless of what happens to the overall economy And I think as people start seeing that and start seeing that opportunity I think you know theyre going to come right back and the stock will be right back whereabove where we were before Bartiromo All right Good to have you with us Thanks so much Lots of luck Mr Skilling Skilling Thank you Maria Bartiromo Jeffrey Skilling Enrons president joining us live

Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year contract Earlier in February CPN had reached agreement with the DWR on a separate year contract for an additional mws EIX WMB MLPFS was a manager of the most recent public offering of securities of

Enrons Skilling Vows to Meet or Beat Profit Projections New York July Bloomberg Enron Corp will meet or beat its profit projections this year and next Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said criticizing analysts whove recently lowered their forecasts for the largest energy trader Enron said July that it expects to make a share this year and in We will hit those numbers and we will beat those numbers Skilling told a meeting of analysts and investors in New York Enron shares have fallen about percent since it made the profit forecasts Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who downgraded US energy companies because of falling prices for power and natural gas Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by Enron customers in California and India and losses by Enrons broadband trading unit which may hurt Enrons profits All of these are bunk Skilling said These are not issues for this stock The shares of Enron fell cents to in early afternoon trading today Enron makes much of its money from profits from arranging trades of power gas oil and other commodities Skilling said It returns are based more on the volume of trades and energy contracts than on the prices of the commodities themselves he said The growth of our sales is not driven by the economy Skilling said Its driven by the growth of markets The refusal of a state government in India to pay million in power bills is not going to hurt Enrons earnings Skilling said In India we have government guarantees on the performance of our contract Skilling said Were convinced well be paid in full for the million the company has invested so far plus unpaid power bills Enron owns percent of Dabhol Power Co which invested about billion in a power plant in India In California Enron is owed more than the states power grid manager has accused the company of overcharging Skilling said California is negotiating refunds with energy traders and generators after power prices soared in the state leaving its two largest utilities so far in debt they could no longer buy electricity for their customers The state has threatened to sue if power sellers dont agree to billion in refunds Enron will cut its losses as it waits out a meltdown in broadband communications Skilling said The companys plan to trade space on fiberoptic telecommunications network helped its stock rise percent last year The stock has plunged percent this year as the collapse of Internet companies darkened the outlook for broadband companies and natural gas prices dropped from record highs in December Houstonbased Enron is selling more power in Europe and more energymanagement contracts to smaller commercial customers in the US company executives said Energy management contracts are agreements to buy energy for customers and find ways to cut their energy consumption Enron also is poised to profit from a Bush administration proposal to expand competition for wholesale power Skilling said USA Enron says would not pay California refund By Timothy Gardner Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK July Reuters Energy firm Enron Corp would not pay its minuscule portion of the nearly billion California claims energy companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid to last spring Governor Gray Davis a Democrat said he is prepared to go to court to retrieve the money But Enron the No US natural gas and electricity marketer does not intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges which Skilling said was minuscule The billion number is bogus to begin with Skilling told analysts at a meeting about Enrons secondquarter earnings in New York Skilling said Enrons share of the alleged overcharge is million He said Enron should in fact recover million in net purchases from California At least one sector of Californias electricity regulation system agrees that Enrons involvement was small in the power crisis in which electricity prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states power grid show Enron accounted for percent of the alleged billion overcharge The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its biweekly commissioners meeting in part to consider the refunds after a federal mediator rejected Californias claims On July FERC Chief Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for further action Wednesdays meeting is the last scheduled before the commission takes a monthlong break STILL ROUNDS TO BE FOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA Enrons problems in California are far from being settled A committee of the California Senate investigating suspected price gouging during the power crunch recently found Enron in contempt for refusing to disclose confidential sales and bidding records The California Senate last used the contempt ruling in against a cement company but eventually the states Supreme Court threw out the ruling saying the charges were too vague Just before the California Senate voted to hold Enron in contempt the Houstonbased company sued in a California court on a claim that FERC not the California Senate had jurisdiction They California are making political noise we dont like said Skilling He said if the situation got worse the company could reduce its market share there Well walk away from the situation and reserve out he said Although Enron claims little involvement in the alleged overcharge the company says it has learned from the crisis Skilling said that looking forward Enron will avoid dealing with intermediaries that the company contends helped lead to the power crunch Were focused on retail in California were going direct to customers without dealing with an intermediary said Skilling Shares in Enron which reported earnings slightly better than expected on July were down cents to in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange That is down

Robertson Linda Subject CAISO cuts refund estimate to B from B Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To B From B Updated Wednesday July AM ET By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to billion from billion when an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was taken into account according to data submitted to FERC last week The California Independent System Operators estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview and its estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the judge following the conclusion of days of talks between power suppliers and the state over potential refunds last week Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate however the state is sticking to the original billion figure which has been called arbitrary by critics The billion estimate merely establishes a potential framework for settlement discussions Eric Hildebrandt the ISOs chief analyst on the matter told the FERC FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner who has dismissed the billion figure as baseless and criticized Californias delegation for not negotiating in good faith estimated in his report on the talks that refunds due may amount to about billion Power suppliers offered just over million Wagner has recommended FERC hold a day hearing to set the level of refunds and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed The ISOs original billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didnt go through the ISOs wholesale markets the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases the ISO made estimates We know the volume of the bilateral deals Hildebrandt said The refund amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market Resetting The Baseline Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the ISO and CalPX markets which were set up by the states deregulation law for Californias three investorowned utilities to purchase power in addition to sales to the California Department of Water Resources The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX news msgs unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January DWR has also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy SRE news msgs unit San Diego Gas Electric Co In arriving at his new estimate the ISOs Hildebrandt also recalculated fair prices the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined by retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator needed to meet demand each hour But last week after Hildebrandt completed his billion estimate Wagner recommended to FERC commissioners that the June price control formula be modified when used retroactively to determine refunds Those modifications if applied to the ISOs estimate would cut refunds much further For example FERCs price limits are now based on a monthly average of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state Wagner recommended using power producers actual gas costs Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California using actual prices would cut potential refunds sharply Also Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about onethird according to Hildebrandts previous monthly breakdown ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagners recommendations but the ISO will still include sales back to May said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle The reason were not going back just to Oct is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid McCorkle said We just maintain that position FERC Baseline Questioned In addition Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERCs new formula the price cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have been available not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand Thats because the FERCs new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time Hildebrandt said Applying that rule would raise the ISOs revised estimate substantially to billion from billion One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher Hildebrandt said was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units Considering only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the rewards for such withholding he said The judge is in error to suggest that the actual leastefficient unit used would have been called on if the mustoffer requirement were in effect Hildebrandt said in an interview In arriving at his estimate Hildebrandt determined the difference between actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and for every hour since May had price controls been in effect The ISO released only the total potential refund not the companyspecific shares Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his numbers arent justified These are based on very tangible records he said The idea that its a black box is misleading By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Jason Leopold in Los Angeles contributed to this article

Use Solar Power LOS ANGELESBUSINESS WIREJuly via NewsEdge Corporation Neutrogena Corporation a Johnson amp Johnson company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced today the completion of a kilowatt million solar power system at the companys headquarters located near LAX The system was made possible through the LADWP Solar Incentive Program that substantially lowers the purchase price of such systems for the municipally owned utilitys customers The solar system covers square feet of roof area and will help reduce the companys energy consumption by approximately percent monthly This is the type of leadership the people of California need from the corporate sector to successfully meet the energy consumption demands in the State said Dr Woodrow Clark senior policy analyst energy and reliability for California Governor Gray Davis I commend the LADWP for their promotion of solar energy and strongly encourage other companies to follow Neutrogenas lead in using solar power Neutrogena received a million Solar Incentive or rebate from LADWP Its system utilizes Siemens Solar panels and was designed and installed by the PowerLight Corporation This new solar power system is an example of the innovative ways the City and local businesses are working together to conserve energy said Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn Using solar power will lead to a cleaner environment in Los Angeles and I urge other corporations to follow suit This is truly remarkable a single company has installed a solar system that provides power equivalent to that used by average size Los Angeles homes And by doing so it frees up that energy for use elsewhere At a time when every kilowatt counts this is a major breakthrough said Ruth Galanter chair of the Los Angeles City

Metro Desk Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry

Price Gouging Beyond FERCs Reach ISO By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February American Electric Power Service Corp AEP million Arizona Public Service Co PNW million Aquila Power Corp ILA million Avista Energy Inc AVA million Automated Power Exchange million British Columbia Power Exchange Corp million Calpine

of analysts and investors in New York Enron shares have fallen about percent since it made the profit forecasts Skilling blamed the decline on analysts who downgraded US energy companies because of falling prices for power and natural gas Analysts have also cited concern about unpaid power bills by Enron customers in California and India and losses by Enrons broadband trading unit which may hurt Enrons profits All of these are bunk Skilling said These are not issues for this stock The shares of Enron fell cents to in early afternoon trading today Enron makes much of its money from profits

Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK July Reuters Energy firm Enron Corp would not pay its minuscule portion of the nearly billion California claims energy companies owe the state for overcharges during the Western power crunch Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday California alleges that electricity generators and marketers owe the state billion for overcharging it during the power crisis from mid to last spring Governor Gray Davis a Democrat said he is prepared to go to court to retrieve the money But Enron the No US natural gas and electricity marketer does not intend to pay its portion of the alleged overcharges which Skilling said was minuscule The billion number is bogus to begin with Skilling told analysts at a meeting about Enrons secondquarter earnings in New York Skilling said Enrons share of the alleged overcharge is million He said Enron should in fact recover million in net purchases from California At least one sector of Californias electricity regulation system agrees that Enrons involvement was small in the power crisis in which electricity prices reached records and rolling brownouts darkened many areas Sales records kept by the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states power grid show Enron accounted for percent of the alleged billion overcharge The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is meeting on Wednesday in its biweekly commissioners meeting in part to consider the refunds after a federal mediator rejected Californias claims On July FERC Chief Administration Judge Curtis Wagner swung the issue back to the commission for further action Wednesdays meeting is the last scheduled before the commission takes a monthlong break STILL ROUNDS TO BE FOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA Enrons problems in California are far from being settled A committee of the California Senate investigating suspected price gouging during the power crunch recently found Enron in contempt for refusing to disclose confidential sales and bidding records The California Senate last used the contempt ruling in against a cement company but eventually the states Supreme Court threw out the ruling saying the charges were too vague Just before the California Senate voted to hold Enron in contempt the Houstonbased company sued in a California court on a claim that FERC not the California Senate had jurisdiction They California are making political noise we dont like said Skilling He said if the situation got worse the company could reduce its market share there Well walk away from the situation and reserve out he said Although Enron claims little involvement in the alleged overcharge the company says it has learned from the crisis Skilling said that looking forward Enron will avoid dealing with intermediaries that the company contends helped lead to the power crunch Were focused on retail in California were going direct to customers without dealing with an intermediary said Skilling Shares in Enron which reported earnings slightly better than expected on July were down cents to in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange That is down from its peak

Wednesday July PM To Shapiro Richard Steffes James Mara Susan Kingerski Harry Lawner Leslie Tribolet Michael Walsh Kristin Denne Karen Guerrero Janel Kaufman Paul Landwehr Sue M Robertson Linda Subject CAISO cuts refund estimate to B from B Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To B From B Updated Wednesday July AM ET By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to billion from billion when an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was taken into account according to data submitted to FERC last week The California Independent System Operators estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview and its estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the judge following the conclusion of days of talks between power suppliers and the state over potential refunds last week Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate however the state is sticking to the original billion figure which has been called arbitrary by critics The billion estimate merely establishes a potential framework for settlement discussions Eric Hildebrandt the ISOs chief analyst on the matter told the FERC FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner who has dismissed the billion figure as baseless and criticized Californias delegation for not negotiating in good faith estimated in his report on the talks that refunds due may amount to about billion Power suppliers offered just over million Wagner has recommended FERC hold a day hearing to set the level of refunds and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed The ISOs original billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didnt go through the ISOs wholesale markets the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases the ISO made estimates We know the volume of the bilateral deals Hildebrandt said The refund amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market Resetting The Baseline Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the ISO and CalPX markets which were set up by the states deregulation law for Californias three investorowned utilities to purchase power in addition to sales to the California Department of Water Resources The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX news msgs unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January DWR has also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy SRE news msgs unit San Diego Gas Electric Co In arriving at his new estimate the ISOs Hildebrandt also recalculated fair prices the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined by retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator needed to meet demand each hour But last week after Hildebrandt completed his billion estimate Wagner recommended to FERC commissioners that the June price control formula be modified when used retroactively to determine refunds Those modifications if applied to the ISOs estimate would cut refunds much further For example FERCs price limits are now based on a monthly average of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state Wagner recommended using power producers actual gas costs Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California using actual prices would cut potential refunds sharply Also Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about onethird according to Hildebrandts previous monthly breakdown ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagners recommendations but the ISO will still include sales back to May said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle The reason were not going back just to Oct is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid McCorkle said We just maintain that position FERC Baseline Questioned In addition Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERCs new formula the price cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have been available not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand Thats because the FERCs new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time Hildebrandt said Applying that rule would raise the ISOs revised estimate substantially to billion from billion One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher Hildebrandt said was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units Considering only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the rewards for such withholding he said The judge is in error to suggest that the actual leastefficient unit used would have been called on if the mustoffer requirement were in effect Hildebrandt said in an interview In arriving at his estimate Hildebrandt determined the difference between actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and for every hour since May had price controls been in effect The ISO released only the total potential refund not the companyspecific shares Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his numbers arent justified These are based on very tangible records he said The idea that its a black box is misleading By Mark Golden Dow Jones

million solar power system at the companys headquarters located near LAX The system was made possible through the LADWP Solar Incentive Program that substantially lowers the purchase price of such systems for the municipally owned utilitys customers The solar system covers square feet of roof area and will help reduce the companys energy consumption by approximately percent monthly This is the type of leadership the people of California need from the corporate sector to successfully meet the energy consumption demands in the State said Dr Woodrow Clark senior policy analyst energy and reliability for California Governor Gray Davis I commend the LADWP for their promotion of solar energy and strongly encourage other companies to follow Neutrogenas lead in using solar power Neutrogena received a million Solar Incentive or rebate from LADWP Its system utilizes Siemens Solar panels and was designed and installed by the PowerLight Corporation This new solar power system is an example of the innovative ways the City and local businesses are working together to conserve energy said Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn Using solar power will lead to a cleaner environment in Los Angeles and I urge other corporations to follow suit This is truly remarkable a single company has installed a solar system that provides power equivalent to that used by average size Los Angeles homes And by doing so it frees up that energy for use elsewhere At a time when every kilowatt counts this is a major breakthrough said Ruth Galanter chair of the Los Angeles City Councils Commerce Energy and Natural Resources Committee Neutrogena headquarters is located in Councilmember Galanters district Being a good corporate citizen is very important to Neutrogena and Johnson amp Johnson said Michael McNamara president of Neutrogena Corporation and this is a very tangible representation of our commitment to bettering the cities where we work and live And were grateful to the LADWP who brought this program to our attention and assisted us every step of the way According to Angelina Galiteva LADWP Director of Strategic Planning The Neutrogena system will eliminate more than pounds of carbon dioxide CO annually which is the equivalent of taking automobiles off Los Angeles streets We can all breathe a little easier thanks to LADWP customers such as Neutrogena Through its Solar Power Program LADWP offers its residential and commercial customers an Incentive payment or rebate of or per watt for solar electric systems in order to make these systems more affordable To date LADWP has received Solar Incentive requests that total over million dollars The Department goal is to encourage the installation of solar systems in Los Angeles by and to install up to megawatts of power each year for the

JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February American Electric Power Service Corp AEP million Arizona Public Service Co PNW million

Cost Data Spread the Blame Power Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried records show RICH CONNELL ROBERT J LOPEZ DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from a megawatthour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officialsDynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were to above last year Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midJanuary The average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from in January to in May Spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houstonbased Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatthour And Atlantabased Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatthour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged a megawatthour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of per megawatthour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase million in power in April and May about more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatthour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday

Bustamonte Gary I just sent this to your other email address The Lt Gov was in on this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings so this may come up The credibility of these former SDGE employees was very weak in the hearing and their allegations are absurd To California news media covering electricity crisis As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas Electric employees we have been in the news a bit lately To add a bit of clarity to the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through each of the three claims and our response To more fully understand the situation please read the attached story that appeared in the LA Times yesterday These reporters had the logs that were stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks ago We went through these log books line by line with these reporters They also obtained confidential information from the CalISO during these three days January that indicated that we were operating at their instruction when ramping up an down the units This is because the ISO purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the states supply and demand is in balance This is a common practice and done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide this service Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when they were made formally in Senator Dunns committee hearing Friday although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone I understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDGE employees tomorrow We had tried to personally meet with the governor last summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and megawatts of peaking plants in and and were not able to Tom Williams Director of Public Affairs Duke Energy North America Morro Bay CA Los Angeles Times via Dow Jones Publication Date Saturday June Page B Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By DOUG SMITH CARL INGRAM and RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS SACRAMENTO Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused officials of Duke Energy Co of manipulating Californias crippled electricity market for higher profits but records and interviews show that the company was responding partly to state instructions Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistleblower allegations which called them baseless The former employees at Dukes South Bay facility told a legislative committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up and down like a yoyo in an apparent gambit to drive up profits In support of the allegations the workers produced logs showing Dukes trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power emergencies over three days in midJanuary Duke officials who will testify in the weeks ahead said the up and down throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state which had paid the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System Operator Moreover CalISO which in the past has accused power firms of withholding electricity to boost prices stressed Friday that it regularly directs generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside CalISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Its energy that can be called upon instantly to meet a fluctuation in demand or within minutes or within an hour Certainly we call on standby services regularly to meet these fluctuations The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more than years first for San Diego Gas Electric and later under contract for Duke They were let go by Duke in April Former power plant mechanics Ed G Edwards Jr and Glenn D Johnson accused Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation capacity beginning in leaving workers puzzled Managers brushed aside questions about the activity saying they were for economic reasons the workers said Sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days Sometimes it would be down for two or three hours It didnt make sense Johnson said He said the phrase appeared to be another way to explain limiting the load or curtailing the load to boost prices Instead of running two units to make the same price Johnson said you could run one unit and make three times the price Some energy experts argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in Californias tight electricity market The third worker Jimmy Olkjer an assistant control room operator said such actions began after Duke began operating the plant Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee chairman asked Olkjer whether SDGE operated in the same manner No he said Edwards one of the exmechanics said prolonged repairs by Duke were part of the apparent gaming of the power market Once he was directed to throw away pallets of power plant parts he said Some of it was brand new stuff in its original packaging I used a forklift took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets Edwards said He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part which in the past would have been readily available Duke officials bragged about their moneymaking ways Edwards said At employee parties after the first year of operation Duke executives boasted that they made more money than they had expected in five years Dunn and Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey a committee member said later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers testimony but that it did not constitute a smoking gun Both said they would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators Duke officials who will testify before the committee next month said CalISO controlled much of the ramping activity Our employees followed the directions of the grid operator said Bill Hall who oversees Dukes plant operations in the West Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the plants inventory system said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman Duke has decreased outages and significantly increased its production since purchasing the plant he said The proofs in the numbers he said One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the previous owner SDGE as well as by Duke CalISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities with Duke But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and standby power at the plant That electricity can be ordered on and off the system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid In the January period focused on at Fridays hearing records show that three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver standby power The fourth unit was shut for servicing On Jan for example records show that the agency called on one unit to increase output by megawatts at am and reduce it by that same amount two hours later Then at noon the agency ordered more megawatts cutting it back to at pm By days end the agency had asked for an additional megawatts A second unit was instructed to add or more megawatts four times on the same day A third unit was ramped up or down times bouncing from zero to as high as megawatts The records show only power that ISO actually needed The agency refused to disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had not called on But after reviewing records for the midJanuary period CalISO manager of markets Brian Rahman said The most viable reason why any one unit would not have been producing would have been for operating reserve Here is a link to the release below californiareleasesnrasp DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO June SACRAMENTO Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator ISO to track fluctuations in electricity demand and the plant operated at top reliability The company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energys own direction The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas Electric SDGE who were not hired as part of the new operating team when Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April Bill Hall vice president of Duke Energys western operations said These allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated by people who dont know the full story Hall reviewed the charges and the facts Charge Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices during times when energy supplies were short The facts The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to meet system reliability and Duke Energys contractual commitments While the three exworkers allude to log books from the plant control room with notations from Duke Energy Trading Marketing DETM the former SDGE South Bay employees apparently did not know that that the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator Our records of ISO directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations Charge The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO prices The facts South Bays megawatt jetfueled unit was designed principally to provide startup power to the stations steam units This unit has been made available to provide as much energy as possible to California during the states energy crisis During the period in question the jetfueled unit was being operated because the price of jet fuel was substantially less than the cost of natural gas This resulted in lower marginal costs The megawatt unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energys California contractual commitments This electricity was not being bid into the ISO market so there was no way it could have influenced ISO market prices Charge Inventory management including throwing out spare parts at South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs The facts At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable for service The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard industry practices Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for South Bay when we assumed operations for the plant in We retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of inventory that was damaged or obsolete Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our power plants operating during Californias energy crisis Duke Energy continues to deliver real solutions to the states energy needs and to operate its business with integrity Duke Energy will hold a media briefing

utilities and avoid helping state foot the bill June By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Californias business community is locked in a battle with energy regulators and lawmakers about how deregulation will ultimately pan out and whether companies will be stuck paying most of the tab for the states electricity crisis Business groups want to continue down the road toward deregulation They are lobbying politicians to pass legislation that would let companies buy electricity directly from power suppliers bypassing the states regulated utilities In our hearts we still believe we can make this a competitive market and get some cost savings said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association which represents stores in the state including Home Depot Target and Albertsons But Gov Gray Davis foray into longterm contracts agreeing to pay billion over to years for power could squash that ambition The states Public Utilities Commission delayed a proposal June to restrict companies from signing socalled direct access contracts with power providers Regulators are expected to rule on the proposal next week The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve Californias costly power crisis It will determine whether businesses with residential customers pay for the bulk of the states future energy purchases It also could determine whether Southern California Edison the states cashstrapped No utility will avoid bankruptcy and whether deregulation will survive in any form The governor got it exactly wrong said Peter Navarro an economics professor at the University of California Irvine who is running for the San Diego City Council The longterm contract strategy is a de facto reregulation of the market because it eliminates the ability of industrial customers to bargain for a lower price Direct access was a key component of the deregulation law designed to break the monopoly of Californias utilities Under this concept all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility just as they pick a longdistance phone company Currently businesses and government entities have direct access as well as about residential customers but some energy service providers such as Enron Corp are dropping their residential customers Direct access is at the center of the latest Edison bailout plan sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Under the plan the largest businesses would agree to pay billion of Edisons debts over years In exchange businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by But energy regulators may not let companies off the hook at such a bargain price David Gamson an energy adviser to PUC Commissioner Geoffrey F Brown said regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system the state will be stuck with too much electricity under longterm electricity contracts through That would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the billion in future power costs Complicating the issue is Wall Street The states bankers led by JP Morgan are nervous about selling as much as billion in planned state bonds if businesses now the largest ratepayers in the state after governments find a way out of the system The bonds are meant to repay the state for billion in powerbuying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs Business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills If businesses are allowed to sign on with outside energy providers that revenue stream would be in jeopardy We have companies now that want to get belowcost power from the state but when the market turns they want to leave said Lawrence Lingbloom chief policy adviser on energy to Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey Remaining customers would be left with those costs and it would create a death spiral for the revenue stream Consumer groups oppose direct access because it would allow businesses to avoid paying most of the costs of the energy crisis Direct access is a policy that should be dead because its a key adjunct to deregulation said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica But right now its a policy thats driving all the deals Even as regulators and consumer groups try to snuff out direct access business groups are lobbying to save it with the help of key legislators Two bills one sponsored by Bowen who heads the Senate energy committee and a second by Assemblyman Dave Kelley RHemet would rescind language in previous legislation that gave the Public Utilities Commission authority to block direct access Both proposals would require businesses to pay the state an exit fee Those fees havent yet been determined but they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases Companies say they dont want to pay Direct access has allowed businesses to enter fixed price contracts to get stable rates said Shawn Covell senior manager for governmental affairs at Qualcomm Inc in San Diego Its really unfair when you have businesses that have taken their time to protect themselves to punish them Qualcomm which makes telecommunications equipment saw its energy bills double to million last year The company signed a contract with an energy service provider Strategic Energy in Carlsbad and capped its rates Otherwise Covell said its electricity costs would have doubled again this year Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista is a directaccess customer The district with students spends about million a year on energy said Jim Clark its energy manager His district won a watchdog award for efficiency from the San Diego County Taxpayers Association because it locked in lower rates When Gov Gray Davis announced in January that the state would begin signing longterm contracts Clark extended the districts contract through at cents per kilowatthour enabling it to save million a year he said As soon as Davis made the announcement we knew the market was going to move he said The market only changes when people buy When the state of California steps to the plate the price goes to the moon Davis has maintained that the longterm contracts between the state and power suppliers helped bring down high spot market prices in recent weeks by removing demand from that market But Clark and others who want to go the directaccess route fear the government will force businesses to pay for all the costs of the energy crisis including rate increases of percent to percent plus surcharges to pay off billion in forthcoming state bonds Businesses will be required to pay for the mistakes that the governor and the Legislature have made he said Who else is going to pay for it Ultimately it will fall on the heads of all consumers Register staff writer Hanh Kim Quach contributed

JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones An investigation by Californias attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity persons familiar with the probe said Monday The sources including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer said generators arent likely to be prosecuted even though it appears they did withhold supply and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal one PUC commissioner said California Gov Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night spokesman Steve Maviglio said Maviglio refused to disclose details of the attorney generals briefing but said the investigation was ongoing We have not called off the dogs Maviglio said Were still pressing the attorney general to pursue the investigation The governor who has repeatedly blamed the states yearlong power crisis on market manipulation by generators is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to take legal action against generators but that claim was premature another PUC commissioner said The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and earlier this year but after dozens of interviews with economists traders and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal behavior We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace thats documented one of the commissioners said The question is whether thats illegal and I dont think it is The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices the other commissioner said because it passed a flawed deregulation bill The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers in the best interest of their shareholders to do exactly what they have done the commissioner said Unless theyre talking with each other and there is evidence of absolute colluding were not going to get to first base The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke Energy DUK Dynegy Inc DYN Mirant Corp MIR Williams Cos WMB Reliant Energy Inc REI and others but that too is going to be difficult How do you sue someone for being unethical the person in Lockyers office said A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldnt comment but said the probe is ongoing Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldnt comment on the investigation but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC The generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully Severin Borenstein director of the University of California at Berkeley Energy Institute said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust behavior Borenstein said Prosecuting generators is a longshot he said They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys were in the same room Phil Verlager an economist specializing in energy issues said generators didnt even act unethically because the setup of Californias deregulation law allowed generators to get away with withholding power Even if no smoking gun has been found tough talk by PUC President Lynch scared the suppliers the commissioner said They got the message that they ought to play the game Lynch didnt return calls for comment Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable prices even if it isnt illegal Borenstein said By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Calif GovEvidence May Allow Criminal Case Vs Generators By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California investigations have turned up a growing body of evidence that may allow the states attorney general to pursue criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power prices in the state the office of California Gov Gray Davis said Tuesday The governors office didnt detail that evidence however and persons familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence exists The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of civil and criminal actions Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a short written statement There is a growing body of evidence that may give the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by generators operating in the states wholesale electricity market Maviglio didnt disclose further details of the investigation Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld but hasnt been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal There is no evidence of criminal behavior one said It just doesnt exist S David Freeman senior energy adviser to Davis acknowledged the distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington DC about allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices It may not be criminal conduct but its a crime he said Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators because theres likely no smoking gun Any claim that the investigation hasnt turned up evidence of criminal activity is an overstatement Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said The investigation is ongoing she said Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent sharp decline in power prices in the West An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to prosecuting the energy companies so they will continue to play the game The governor who has repeatedly blamed the states yearlong power crisis on market manipulation by generators is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Calif Judge To Rule On Confidentiality For Generator Data Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge said Tuesday he will issue a written ruling on a lawsuit filed by Reliant Energy Inc REI against the states attorney general to prevent confidential subpoenaed documents from being shared with third parties Superior Court Judge George H Wu said he would take the case under submission and issue a written ruling in less than days Reliant Dynegy Inc DYN and Mirant Corp MIR agreed May to turn over confidential documents to California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who is investigating allegations of manipulation and criminal behavior in the states wholesale power market Reliant agreed to turn over the information which includes bid data as long as Lockyers office agreed not to

panel sounds like it had quite a few testy exchanges Calif Officials Tell FERC To Face Political Reality Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc By Bryan Lee OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow JonesThe political uproar generated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions decision that it had no legal authority to order refunds in Californias highflying power market washed up on the agencys doorstep Thursday Californias governor and other government leaders banded together to criticize FERC at a public meeting Thursday one week after FERC issued an order proposing market reforms for California California Gov Gray Davis delivered a stinging rebuke of the commission via videotape as state legislators testified that FERC must act quickly or the states voters may take things into their own hands with a ballot initiative Davis summed up the discontent by noting that FERC had concluded that prices in Californias firstinthenation deregulated electricity market were neither just nor reasonable but you are not willing to do anything about it Instead Davis said FERC is asking the state to knuckle under to high prices for the next few years while the economy suffers I cannot allow you to do that Davis said without elaborating on what recourse he intends to take Other state officials in a giveandtake that at times bordered on acrimony insisted FERC was wrong in interpreting the Federal Power Act as limiting the commissions authority to order refunds State Sen Debra Bowen who chairs the utility committee called for FERC to recognize the political reality within the state of its decision not to order refunds or to firmly regulate prices until the power crisis is abated We will have a political revolt on our hands Bowen warned once all the states retail consumers and not just those in San Diego are exposed to the markets uncontained price volatility in the near future Congress never repealed FERCs mandate under the power act to assure that prices are just and reasonable said state Sen Steve Peace who warned that the commissions credibility was at stake in not ordering refunds FERC clearly has the authority to order refunds retroactively and the courts will support such an interpretation Peace argued San Diego Board of Supervisors Chairman Diane Jacob accused the states unregulated power providers of white collar crime San Diego County which has privatized its trash collection and telecommunications assets has voted to pursue forming a municipal utility to get out from under the yoke of the FERCregulated market Jacob said Jacob called on FERC to reconsider the scope of its authority to order refunds Your grant of marketbased rate authority rested on the premise that was adequate to assure just and reasonable rates she said Peace predicted that unless FERC takes stronger action California voters will pass a ballot initiative to condemn the states electricity system and make it government owned Well build the damn power plants if we have to Peace said This is going to end up in a lawsuit no matter what you do Peace said urging the commission to be sued by power providers rather than state consumers Were playing by the rules said William Hall asset management vice president for Duke Energy North Americas Western region DUK Were not doing anything wrong and were confident we cant be ordered to provide refunds Hall said The state officials rejected arguments against price caps and reregulation of the market voiced earlier in the day by power marketers and generators who warned that price controls will only worsen the states power supply problems by serving as a disincentive for investment in new power plants New generation is coming on line in California despite existing price caps the state officials said Five power plants are set to go on line next year and another three are in the pipeline for said William Keese California Energy Commission chairman Plenty of people are not being chased away who will build supply said Michael Kahn chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board There is a very long line of those willing to step into the place of Enron said Peace referring to the companys testimony earlier that it scuttled plans to build megawatts of peaking power in the state because of price uncertainty Supply is being addressed Whats not being addressed is pricing said Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utility Commission The session threatened to become acrimonious as Peace repeatedly directed verbal jabs at FERC Commissioner Curtis Hebert Jr the lone Republican among the four sitting commissioners and an ardent opponent of price controls and market intervention The governors critical taped remarks ended with a pointed barb that FERCs marketrestructuring order last week undermined the states authority but apart from that I think youre a fine group of people Peace then retorted to Hebert I dont think he included you in his comment Hebert stood his ground and fired back at Peace I understand your emotions therefore I dont take offense at your shots at me Hebert said I didnt set up the infrastructure of Californias power market There are people in this room who did he said alluding to Peace You want us to intervene as you see fit not as we see fit You quite frankly made some decisions that got the state of California into trouble Hebert rejoined Bowen urged FERC to think of itself as the Alan Greenspan of Californias power market and temper irrational exuberance I agree that Alan Greenspan is the guy I dont think youd like what hed tell you to do countered Hebert Our job isnt to populistically say things that will inflame the people of California Our job is to set markets Hebert said FERC Chairman James Hoecker closed the session with remarks illustrating his skepticism regarding the call for regulating prices and ordering refunds until the market can be corrected Im not sure how we get there Hoecker said Im not sure we have the option of going backward in order to go forward without getting run over Hoecker said By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Sincerely Gary S Fergus This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may

Transcript Street Signs Date November Time PM PM Station CNBC Location Network Program Street Signs Maria Bartiromo anchor Well there have been few winners over the past few weeks on Wall Street even some of the energy and utility companies which were seen as safe havens in the market selloff have been hit hard this week Enron is one example Down fifteen percent in a week alone Take a look at this chart over the last couple of days And we see Enron down today by nine percent And it has begun falling Since Tuesday or so its been going down Graphic Enron Corp ENE down week stock chart Joining us now to discuss this company and the sector is Jeff Skilling Enrons president Mr Skilling good to have you with us Jeffrey Skilling President Enron Well thank you for inviting me on on such a positive uplifting day Maria Bartiromo Maybe you can make it a little more positive and uplifting for us Hows business Skilling Business is great If you look at our key energy businesses our wholesale and retail energy business yeartodate our volumeswhich really dictates our profitability in our wholesale businessare up about sixty percent versus last year In our retail energy business were up a hundred percent in contracting You know weve said earnings were on track for the fourth quarter at thirtyfive cents which is a twentypercent yearoveryear gain in net income Graphic Enron Corp ENE down year stock chart So business is great Bartiromo So you think Wall Street has it wrong Whats wrong with the stock over the last week or so Skilling Well you know I thinkmy own opinion on this is that youyou have a lot of people that are just uncomfortable with the general environment you know the presidential election people are starting to get concerned about how slowdown in growth of the economy willwill impact certain companies But I think you have a bunch of portfolio managers with their hair on fire running around And you know its kind of ready fire aim Bartiromo Right Skilling But I think as time goes on and people see the fundamentals particularly of our business and where we stand in the industry and growth prospects for the future you know Im convinced its goingits going to bounce right back Bartiromo And part of your business of course is trading Your Enron online one year this week is that right Skilling One year this week And its been a huge success Were up to over two hundred fifty billion dollarsbillion dollars in transactions Its the largestWebbased transaction site in the world In fact yesterday we did over four billion dollarsyesterday alone So you know we made a tremendous transition into the newnew Internetbased business Its had a big impact on our growth rate which has been very positive Soand Bartiromo Right Skilling then the stocks down So what do you do Bartiromo Soso youre basically making money regardless of the price of oil because youreyoure trading it Skilling Yeah Bartiromo It doesnt really matter if oil prices are high or low in your opinion Skilling Well ifif you really get down to what we sell customers wouwhat our customers are buying from Enron is reliable delivery and predictable prices And when you have this kind of volatility in the energy markets that you see particularly in places like California thats what people want to buy I mean you know the prospects for our business have never been better Bartiromo Well let me ask you a question I mean how is that been any different than an investment bank I mean you take a look at your pricetoearnings ratio versus some of the investment banks and the investment banks have been coming down quite significantly over the last six months or so because of that trading that they do Now your company is doing trading Sure its not trading stocks but would you compare yourself to an investment bank Skilling No You know itsits totally different Ifif you think of what we dowhat we do is we put together packages you know wewe take components of different energy pieces We put them together in packages for our customers Now trading is a piece of that because you have to have access to the markets for certain of those components sic But where we really create value for our customers is we put together a total energy solution for them Itsitsits more like I think the analogy is better that were like Toyota versus General Motors You know if you look at the Exxons and Shells big vertically integrated companies we do it much more flexibly lower costs than they do And thats why weve grown so much You know ourover the last ten years our wholesale business which we really started ten years ago has grown at a compound rate of forty percent a year since then I mean thatconsistently year in and year out Its a better business model And thats whats driving ourthats whats driving our growth and driving our profitability Bartiromo What do you make of whats going on Washington these days Theres been a lot of speculation that your CEO Kenneth Lay may join the Bush campaign if in fact Mr Bush is our next president Is that true And whats your comments on whats going on right now Skilling Well I justI was just talking to Kenny a couple of minutes ago andand what Ken said is that he has no intention of doing that at this point And you know who knows what theyll askor who knows who the next presidents going to be you know What Ive said to him You ought to do some sort of a deal They ought to flip a coin for the president If it comes down on the middle theyll make him president andand that would be wonderful for everybody Bartiromo Jeff how has this economic slowdown impacted your company Skilling It wont impact us at all Maria Itits kind of interesting because we compete in the nonregulated portion of the energy markets and broadband markets But unregulated portion of the energy markets So even though overall energy is growing relatively slowly the portion thats deregulatingor that is deregulated is growing by leaps and bounds If you take thethe overall energy market in Europe North America and Japan only about twenty percent of that market has deregulated That will be a hundred percent in five years So we should grow just hanging on to current market share And were growing on market share But if we just hang on to our existing market share we should grow by a factor of five just in the energy markets And just to remind you our sales last quarter were thirty billion dollars So were a hundred and thirtya hundredandtwentybilliondollarayear sales clip company Weve got builtin growth of five times over the next five to ten years regardless of what happens to the overall economy And I think as people start seeing that and start seeing that opportunity I think you know theyre going to come right back and the stock will be right back whereabove where we were before Bartiromo All right Good to have you with us Thanks so much Lots of luck Mr Skilling Skilling Thank you Maria Bartiromo Jeffrey Skilling Enrons president joining us live

Californiansthe only people who knew who we invited to the meeting but did not attend were Dick Riordan and Kevin Sharer Saturday May SF Chronicle Enrons secret bid to save deregulationPRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Energy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp quietly courted Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to Californias energy crisis His prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and federal investigations and less rather than more regulation Lay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign contributors hosted a private minute meeting in a conference room at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday Among the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star Schwarzenegger and Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates One participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support Lays vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the states energy mess PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by either reregulating the system or creating a government authority to provide electricity Gov Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in California Theyre trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron executives They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea At the meeting Enron representatives circulated a fourpage position paper titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The Chronicle It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in debt incurred by the states public utilities and that investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power generators and traders a possibility given credibility in studies by regulators and economists One of the talking points read Get deregulation right this time California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a competitive power market system Lay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially produces nothing but makes money as a middleman buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased percent to billion Asked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment One participant said Denne was present at the meeting DC CONNECTIONS Meanwhile Lays power in Washington is reported to have reached unprecedented heights According to a story in yesterdays New York Times Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them The story also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lays desire to further deregulate the nations electricity system Lay denied the allegation Also in attendance at this weeks meeting were Bruce Karatz chief executive of home builder Kaufman Broad Ray Irani chief executive of Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant Amgen Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the worlds first civilian space trip Milken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but declined to be interviewed Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon A spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor attended but was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this issue His intent is to listen to all sides Attached to the Enron handout was a twopage open letter addressed to Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support Lays position and would be willing to sign their names to it The source who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda Email the writers at and Scott Winokur

the body of this email Once we circulate a draft and get a version people are comfortable with Id recommend the following actions but not by Enron send the letter to the governor and all members of the Legislature run the letter as a fullpage ad in key newspapers advance the story to the media for earned coverage possible editorial boards w several CEOs not Enron We could have an effort in both Northern and Southern California w different CEOs to emphasize the bipartisanship and diversity of support for the solution This media effort should target broadcast as well Edit away An open letter to Governor Davis and members of the Legislature Californias energy crisis has persisted and worsened over the past months We have already experienced blackouts and with summer fast approaching unless something is done immediately the worst is yet to come The North American Electric Reliability Council released a report last week that said California is expected to experience more than hours of blackouts this summer thats ten days without power Californias economy cannot afford to grind to a halt because we have no power Two of the states largest companies have been thrown into financial turmoil Pacific Gas Electric has already declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison is on the brink With California spending more than a day on power and depleting cash reserves the States credit rating has been downgraded only Louisiana has a lower rating While there has been much talk of potential solutions none have advanced There is too much at risk to delay another day Therefore we the undersigned are proposing a comprehensive fivestep solution to solve Californias short and longterm energy crisis that includes the following Decrease demand There is no time to build power plants or get additional generation online in time for this summer Therefore the only option to reduce the impact of an electricity shortage this summer is to reduce consumption This can be accomplished in several ways Realtime pricing prices should reflect the cost of producing electricity which varies throughout the day When demand is at a peak prices are high when demand drops so do prices This will give customers a financial incentive to conserve and take simple actions like turning the thermostat up two degrees Demand buydown programs If a customer is willing to pay for kilowatts used heshe ought to be compensated for kilowatts saved NEED TO SAY WHO WILL PAY FOR THIS Increase supply The Governor has taken an important first step by using his executive powers to streamline power plant siting While the state currently has approved power plants totaling megawatts its not enough California ought to be the most attractive place to build power plants transmission lines and pipelines instead its the least There is a backlog of turbines for power plant development yet of the backlogged only are earmarked for California because the state has sent an anywhere but here message to investors The states political leaders must reject action that discourages investment including Legislation that would impose a windfall profits tax on power sold in California and make it a felony to sell power at a price that the state finds unreasonable Continued calls for price caps in wholesale power market caps only create shortages and fail to reduce prices Investigations into allegations that suppliers manipulated power prices Make the utilities creditworthy Under California law utilities are forced to charge frozen rates but they must buy power at higher wholesale prices The utilities inability to recover their costs has forced PGE into bankruptcy and threatens Southern California Edisons solvency The solution to restoring the utilities creditworthiness is to set rates that cover the utilities past debts and future costs and then give customers the power to reduce their bills by conserving or by choosing a competitive energy supplier Get California out of the powerbuying business Once rate increases return the utilities to creditworthiness the role of buying power can be returned to the utility very quickly within three to six months The state should not buy the transmission grid to raise additional cash for the utilities There are other ways to raise funds for example a miniscule rate increase of twotenths of one cent per kilowatt hour could accomplish the same thing and keep the power expertise in the hands of the utilities Get deregulation right in California California never deregulated In fact today there is more regulation than ever before For true deregulation to exist every consumer and business in the state must have the right to hire and fire their energy service provider When California passed a law this year authorizing the state to buy power that same law ABX called for an end to customer choice also called direct access California must rescind ABX and reinstate the right of customers to choose their energy service provider ARE WE INCLUDING CORENONCORE i cant remember We urge the Legislature and Governor to enact legislation that includes these five components and sets California on the path to economic stability The longer the delay the bigger the problem The time to act is now CEO CEO etc

Council NERC released its Summer Assessment today The assessment concludes that California will experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this summer said Michehl R Gent NERC President and CEO and California electricity users will experience rotating blackouts much more so than last summer or this winter The report also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere For your convenience a copy of the press release announcing the Summer Assessment is shown below In addition this press release as well as the subject reports are available from the NERC web site wwwnerccom If you have any questions let me know Sincerely Julie Morgan Contacts Ellen P Vancko or Eugene F Gorzelnik May NERC Releases its Summer Reliability Assessment The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC released its Summer Assessment today The assessment concludes that California will experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this summer said Michehl R Gent NERC President and CEO and California electricity users will experience rotating blackouts much more so than last summer or this winter The report also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere In addition the report cautions that New England New York City and Texas should be closely watched despite having adequate resources to meet demand New England and New York City are particularly sensitive to longterm heat waves and higherthanexpected generating unit forced outages Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area operations into one The report concludes that generating capacity resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in other areas of North America this summer The assessment also points to concerns regarding northtosouth transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United States particularly east of the Mississippi River The ability to transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern Interconnection was severely tested last summer spurred by cool temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south as well as high fuel prices in the south Early indications are that key transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south are already fully subscribed going into this summer and that transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout the summer As a supplement to its Summer Assessment report NERC also published a Summer Special Assessment This document is an indepth independent examination of the expected summer conditions in both California and the Pacific Northwest and is based on interviews with experts from both the California Independent System Operator CAISO and the Northwest Power Pool NWPP NERCs CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC the CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand rotating blackouts are expected NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater than those expected by the CAISO NERC anticipates that firm demand may be curtailed for about hours over the course of this summer with an average firm demand curtailment of about MW NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to serve all their firm electricity demands this summer However NWPP will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst water years on record The independent reports prepared by NERCs Reliability Assessment Subcommittee assess the projected demand and the resources available to meet that demand this summer as well as transmission reliability issues The reports are posted on NERCs web site at wwwnerccom The web site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into NAERO and the electric industrys electricity supply and delivery programs and activities NERC is a notforprofit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to keep the lights on by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States Canada and a portion of Baja California Norte Mexico

others role in keeping the city free of Californias energy crisis By MICHAEL FINNEGAN TERENCE MONMANEY Times Staff Writers With California mired in energy troubles Mayor Richard Riordan and his former power chief S David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los Angeles no rate hikes and no blackouts Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by waging bitter campaigns to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public Pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back To Freeman who has resigned as general manager of the LA Department of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov Gray Davis it seems Riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer California out of the energy crisis So the mayor Freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment With all due respect I have years of experience and knowledgeand he has days Freeman said But hes the mayor and he didnt like it that I didnt just say yes to everything he came up with To Riordan Freemans efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles The mayor said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis And he scoffed at Freeman for saying he had lifted morale at DWP Morale was terrible under him Riordan said I mean they are so relieved right now The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud successful men unable to say I couldnt have done it without X Y and Z Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings And the mayor a Republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with Freeman a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Southern drawl In an interview after his resignation Freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor One of his concerns Freeman said was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agencys progress in protecting the environment Freeman cited Riordans plans concerning coalfired power plants in Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP the nations largest municipal utility The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the Grand Canyon The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale He described the mayors move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees DWP were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the West Ive worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the DWP policy Freeman said And I am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress weve made The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central Utah Riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause In both cases Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los Angeles at an affordable cost By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and expanding the Utah plant Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow Riordan said Natural gas which provides of the fuel for DWP plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides The rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power providers I favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where were going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles Riordan said On the Mohave plant Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the citys share to a buyer that would simply continue running it Its still going to be coaldriven he said How does selling it help the environment The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how LA has dodged the crisis Riordan and the DWP commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches Freeman said The conflict reached its peak on April the day Freeman resigned to become the governors advisor The DWP board president Kenneth T Lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately All we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us Lombard said From Riordans standpoint Freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest The city utility sells surplus power to the state so Freeman would be on both sides of the sales Freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees In an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what Ive accomplished here he said Brian DArcy who heads the union local that represents DWP employees agreed that Riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky DArcy said Riordan said Freeman deserves an Aplus for his work at DWP The mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done to hurt Los Angeles But he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP not just by the mayor but by the agencys board and the City Council In he called for City Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors The proposal went nowhere Freemans concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday The Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP It calls for restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed But Riordan and Galanter who chairs the Councils Commerce Energy and Natural Resources Committee rejected the concept Copyright Los Angeles Times

Announce Plans to Develop New Natural Gas Pipeline to California FYI Wednesday May pm Eastern Time Press Release SOURCE Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP and Calpine Corporation Kinder Morgan and Calpine Announce Plans to Develop New Natural Gas Pipeline To California Sonoran Accepts Binding Bid for Dekathermsday HOUSTON May PRNewswire Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP NYSE KMP news and national independent power company Calpine Corporation NYSE CPN news today announced plans to jointly develop the Sonoran Pipeline subject to a successful open season and all other approvals As proposed the Sonoran Pipeline will be a mile highpressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in California The project will provide much needed natural gas transportation capacity to California to serve rapidly growing electric generation demand In addition producers will be able to move more natural gas from the San Juan Basin through the Sonoran Pipeline This will benefit California consumers as access to these abundant natural gas supplies has been constrained due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure The interstate pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The first phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with the second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer of This exciting project will enable us to grow our core business and extend our natural gas transportation service into new markets said Richard D Kinder chairman and CEO of KMP We dont currently transport natural gas into California but we do own and operate the largest independent products pipeline on the West Coast headquartered in Orange Calif We will utilize our expertise as a major natural gas pipeline operator and transporter to build the Sonoran Pipeline and we look forward to expanding our relationship with Calpine one of the leading power plant developers in America According to Pete Cartwright chairman president and CEO of Calpine the project will serve several important purposes for Calpine The Sonoran Pipeline will help ensure a diverse supply of natural gas in California With our existing plants in California and our plans to bring on line an additional megawatts of capacity it is essential that we have a dependable competitively priced source of natural gas This important new pipeline will allow us to better control our costs in the California market to help lower energy prices and build needed generation This project is a great example of two energy companies joining forces and utilizing their complementary strengths to provide real solutions to Californias energy crisis The project is expected to be developed in two phases Phase One Phase One will consist of approximately miles of inch high pressure natural gas interstate pipeline originating from interconnects with TransColorado Gas Transmission Company Transwestern Pipeline Company and various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan County NM near the Colorado New Mexico state line thus providing access to the major producing basins in the western US The pipeline will continue westward with delivery points on the CaliforniaArizona border near Needles with a mile inch lateral to Topock The pipeline will initially transport up to dekatherms Dth of natural gas per day and can be economically expanded with compression to transport up to million Dth per day A binding open season will be held this month and potential shippers will be given the opportunity to commit to firm capacity on the new line Given sufficient shipper support in the open season Sonoran Pipeline LLC Sonoran proposes an inservice date in the summer of The estimated cost of phase one of the project is approximately million The open season will seek at a minimum year term commitments at a fixed transport rate of per Dth for firm transportation Sonoran proposes to charge shippers actual fuel on Phase One via a fuel tracker Fuel is estimated at percent Sonoran has already received an acceptable binding bid from Calpine Energy Services LP for Dth per day Phase Two Phase Two will be an extension of Phase One and consist of approximately miles of inch and inch highpressure interstate natural gas pipeline continuing from Needles on the California border to points within California terminating near Antioch in Contra Costa County Depending on shipper interest Phase Two will transport from to million Dth of natural gas per day A nonbinding open season will be held on Phase Two simultaneous with the Phase One open season and potential shippers will be given the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm capacity to California delivery points Sonoran has already received a nonbinding bid from Calpine Energy Services LP for Dth per day for Phase Two The estimated cost of Phase Two is approximately billion The pipeline could connect with several gas pipelines utilities and suppliers such as Kern River Mojave Elk Hills Pacific Gas and Electric Company Southern California Gas and numerous gasfired power plants including Calpines along its route Additionally Sonoran would consider other potential connections in accordance with shipper requests After finalizing precedent agreements in which shippers make binding contractual commitments to capacity on the line Sonoran Pipeline will file an application for approval of the project with the FERC Sonoran expects to utilize existing rightofway corridors as much as possible to minimize potential environmental impact Shippers seeking

any conversations w Bailey Forwarded by Karen DenneCorpEnron on PM Susan J Mara PM To Mark NRON Richard nron Jeff nron Janel nron Karen NRON Sandra nron James D nron Harry nron Paul CT cc Subject OpED Editorial SacBee Lauding Williams CHairmans New Position Favoring Caps I got this from one of my Williams counterparts Daniel Weintraub An energy trader says its time to limit profits Published May In a sea of angry fingerpointing namecalling and ridicule Keith Bailey stands out as an island of calm a lonely voice of reason who understands that a companys longterm selfinterest is about more than how much money it can make today Most Californians probably have never heard of Bailey a Kansas City native and chief executive officer of Tulsabased Williams Cos a private energy trader that has profited handsomely from the states recent miseries But Golden Staters from Gov Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma resident He might be the man who saves our future Bailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary caps on the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might return to the Wests energy market His rationale is this To save Californias private electricity market new power plants are desperately needed But not enough of those plants will be built if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product they already are providing Californians though dont want to promise payment without knowing they will be able to afford the bill Shortterm caps on profits Bailey believes are the best way to ease the states fears get everybody paid and move on to a system that works for suppliers and customers One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create something that California can look at and say So long as prices are determined on this basis were prepared to pay Bailey said in an interview This is a mechanism that lets the state say Were not signing a blank check We dont know what the price is going to be but we do know how it will be determined Baileys proposal is different from the limited price caps approved last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and far better for California The federal caps would come with all sorts of strings attached would kick in only during emergencies and would be focused on prices not profits Bailey is proposing that all power sold from now through summer be priced at the cost of producing it plus a profit of percent Thats more than a regulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek and far less than electricity providers have been earning of late Cynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has squeezed all it can from California The firm reported last week that profits doubled in the first quarter of over a year ago with pretax income from its energy services nearly tripling to million Much of the megawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already committed in longterm contracts so Bailey has relatively little to lose if what remains can only be sold at controlled prices But here is at least one measure of Baileys sincerity His company still is owed million for electricity it has provided California And hes not insisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect or even as part of the deal Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with he said Whether that ultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the parties it will sort itself out one way or another Perhaps if we find prices that work going forward that could be used as a framework Bailey an engineer by training says no one should mistake his proposal for a lack of confidence in free markets He still firmly believes that a deregulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the West in the long term He just wants to make sure there is a long term Bailey is watching and listening to California He hears talk of seizing power plants of turning to a public power system He describes these ideas as Draconian and says they would not solve the problem But he also knows there is a limit to what Californians and their elected leaders can take I recognize we live in a democracy and lots of things could happen he said What he is proposing in effect is a safety valve He wants to limit the market in order to save it This is an extraordinary situation Bailey said We need to help create some breathing room We all have to work together and this is the right thing to do Baileys proposal made at a conference of energy producers and traders in Oklahoma last week was almost lost amid all the focus on the price caps approved in Washington But there is still time to give the idea the attention it deserves Properly nourished it could be the breakthrough that solves this crisis Davis and others in California should seize the moment Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax

Public Agencies Too Power DWP is among three governmentrun producers cited as driving prices up Spokesmen deny any market manipulation ROBERT J LOPEZ RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company Governmentowned utilities including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite Californias exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall according to public and confidential records For months Gov Gray Davis legislators and consumer advocates have chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into darkness and economic chaos But they are just part of the equation A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that have allegedly manipulated the electricity market While the document does identify outofstate merchants criticized for gouging it also discloses for the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized profits in the volatile spot market The documentwhich decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a recent state studysingles out three governmentrun agencies as consistently trying to inflate prices They are the DWP the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canadas BC Hydro in British Columbia Like a number of privately owned generators these three producers offered power at a range of high prices and sometimes in large amounts when the state was most desperate They also helped saddle Californias three largest utilities with billions of dollars in debtleading one Pacific Gas Electric to seek bankruptcy protection last week The study by the California Independent System Operator or CalISO analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for large suppliers in the spot or realtime market from May to November The study accounted for factors such as rising production costs increased demand periods of scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy competitive market Money earned above that was called excess profits No entitypublic or privateearned as much in alleged excess profits as British Columbias Powerex the state records show They were the most aggressive bidders said Anjali Sheffrin author of the coded study They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in said Sheffrin who did not discuss any companies by name The Canadian agency reaped million in alleged excessive profitsseveral times the amount collected by all but one of the private generators Second on the list was Atlantabased Southern Co Energy Marketing now called Mirant which collected nearly million in alleged inflated earnings BC Hydro and Mirantalong with the DWP and other producerssay they played by the rules established under Californias flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the states troubles But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins We helped keep the lights on in California And the rates low for their own customers During the past year BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a rainy day account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America Los Angeles Department of Water and Power although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market where emergency purchases are made This according to state documents was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand The strategy also helped prop up prices keeping them from falling The DWPs average hourly bid or asking price for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsabased Williams Cos two major players in the national energy market In addition the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand the report said referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions DWP General Manager S David Freeman called the reports findings outrageous insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state Freeman said noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state He did acknowledge however that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce We have consistently charged CalISO our cost plus he said Its not as though were up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report they never took it personally If youre innocent he said you dont look at the criminal file Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in Californias deregulated market was the US governments Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at federal dams in the ColumbiaSnake River basin Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP records show but reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon recovery program Stephen Oliver a Bonneville vice president said his agency did not act improperly and has asked CalISO for detailed information on how it reached its conclusions He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading for lastminute electricity and offering to pay high prices From our point of view we bid what we had when we had it and we operated precisely within the terms of their rules Oliver said Those rulesand the bidding practices criticized by CalISOso distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp of Missouri which tried to act responsibly has bailed out It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier studiedslightly more than per megawatthour compared to Mirants the highest But the spot market as initially designed made sure that all suppliers offering power received the highest price paid in any hour The result Aquila collected an hour for power it was willing to sell at a singledigit price They werent the culprits said CalISOs Sheffrin Someone else drove that up Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California market because it was too unpredictable Although the company made money he said it also could have lost because of possible downward swings We looked at it and we didnt feel very comfortable with what we saw he said The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the price for everyone But Sheffrin said it hasnt made much difference because the overall prices are still excessive Were saying the patient is sick Sheffrin said of Californias electricity market It needs help and may die BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Top in Profits The California Independent System Operator says that a total of million in extra profits was reaped by

electric power situation for summer Alabama Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve percent above what is needed to meet peak demand Residential and business customers will pay rates about percent above a year ago Alaska Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely Hydroelectric power is plentiful and generating systems are not being taxed Electric bills are expected to fall slightly Arizona There is little likelihood of a power interruption Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates Arkansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely Electric bills are expected to rise percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago when readings topped out at degrees in Little Rock California Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts accelerated construction of new power plants and a bit of luck could help avoid blackouts Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the LA Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isnt connected with the states grid Colorado The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as percent of its power comes from coalfired plants Because of fixed longterm contracts for coal producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments Connecticut No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated Brownouts are possible though if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap Delaware Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs However under a deregulation law the cost of electricity is temporarily capped Florida Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about percent Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases Georgia Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants Rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by percent Hawaii There is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes As an island state Hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand Idaho There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising The states largest utility wants a percent increase in residential rates Illinois Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants Homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through under the states deregulation plan Indiana There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from percent to percent over the past decade Iowa While the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as with serious capacity problems by Only singledigit price increases are expected this summer Kansas Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply percent of residential customers Kentucky Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between percent and percent by largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer Louisiana No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast Maine Five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts No consumer rate increases are expected Maryland The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses Massachusetts Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past months enough supply to outpace demand surges Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as percent for some consumers Michigan Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in utilities cut rates by percent and must cap those rates for five years Although demand for electricity is growing between percent and percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand Minnesota No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure Electricity costs are expected to remain steady Many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter Mississippi Blackouts this summer are unlikely The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be percent to percent higher this summer Entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet Missouri Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line State law bars rate spikes by PSCregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs Montana Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July Flathead Electrics rates rose percent on April and an additional percent increase is possible this fall The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana Nebraska No rolling blackouts are expected Electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by percent to percent Nevada Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up percent to percent a month through September based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases State lawmakers reacting to Californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect Gov Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under and laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed New Hampshire Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days As part of deregulation rates will drop about percent for customers of the states largest electric utility But rates could rise percent to percent for customers of the secondlargest utility New Jersey Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a yearold energy deregulation law Rates are capped until However regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer percent a month through July to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices New Mexico Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months New York To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of small natural gas turbines Upstate New Yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer Rates are regulated across much of the state but in New York City customers pay market prices North Carolina No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities North Dakota The state exports about percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter Ohio No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan Oklahoma There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September but Oklahoma Gas amp Electric which has customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas expects electricity bills to be percent to percent above last summer Oregon Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon Price spikes could occur Pennsylvania No blackouts or brownouts are expected The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through Rhode Island Blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as percent South Carolina With reserves of about percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about percent to reflect higher fuel costs Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up percent by July South Dakota The majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in and should remain steady through the summer No blackouts or brownouts are expected Texas Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills Utah Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts Utah power has received a percent interim rate increase and has percent rate increase awaiting approval Vermont Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low Much of Vermonts electricity is imported from Quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England Electric rates are regulated Virginia Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through Washington Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line Electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases Rates could rise percent to percent this year West Virginia Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase Wisconsin Electric bills could run as much as percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from percent to percent to bolster reliability during the summer Wyoming Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages Xcel Energy serving Cheyenne has applied for a percent price increase Similar filings are expected from other suppliers

Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy Services Relevance Score on Scale of

product is immense Almost half of the worlds population does not have access to electricity or sustainable cooking fuel Instead nearly billion is spent annually on products that many consider

Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

again Thanks Ann NEWS ELECTION PROPOSITION Sparks fly over utilities measure Consumer groups vs broad coalition Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER The San Diego UnionTribune A Copyright SACRAMENTO It looked like a triumph of legislative dealmaking when after a year and a half of talks a sweeping plan to deregulate electricity in California came together in the final hours of the legislative session two years ago The bill brokered mainly by state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon was not opposed by any specialinterest group The complicated measure sailed through both houses of the Legislature without a single no vote But then consumer groups took a second look They reached two main conclusions A promised percent rate reduction is phony they say and ratepayers should not have to pay for privately owned utilities illadvised investments in nuclear power plants Now the consumer groups backed by one of the biggest names in consumer protection Ralph Nader have placed an initiative on the Nov ballot Proposition that would make major changes in the deregulation plan passed two years ago Billions of dollars of ratepayer money has been committed not to a sustainable energy future but to the outright bailout of uneconomic nuclear and fossilfuel plants owned by investors said Nader Proposition prohibits ratepayers from being charged to pay off billion in bonds issued last year to finance a percent cut in electricity rates that took effect last January Furthermore the initiative promises a percent rate reduction by prohibiting utilities from charging ratepayers for the transition costs as they move nuclear and other uneconomical power plants into a deregulated system The ballot measure is alarming to opponents a broad coalition that includes nearly all of the major business labor agriculture and local government groups some environmental groups the Republican and Democratic parties and the leading gubernatorial candidates Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren Opponents say the initiative would be a severe setback for the deregulation process needed to bring more competitive electricity prices to California where rates have been percent higher than the national average The opponents also contend that the initiative could force taxpayers to pay off the billion bond drive up the cost of borrowing for state and local government by damaging bond credit ratings and ultimately result in higher rates for residences and businesses I think its fair to say Proposition is categorically the most disingenuous misleading anticonsumer proposition ever put on the ballot said Peace With heavy funding from utilities opponents have launched an extensive television ad campaign to defeat Proposition Backers of the measure say their campaign will probably be limited to grassroots work Some polls have shown Proposition with a lead But the statewide Field Poll which has decades of experience polling on ballot measures showed the initiative trailing by a ratio of nearly to Mark DiCamillo Field research director said that successful initiatives usually have a lead of about to in early polling DiCamillo said the results of the poll are very ominous for Proposition The stranded issue At the heart of the dispute is what has become known as the stranded costs of the three large privately owned California utilities San Diego Gas Electric Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric The rates that the utilities could charge in the past were set by the California Public Utilities Commission In exchange the utilities had little or no competition and they were required to serve all creditworthy customers in their service areas The utilities invested in nuclear power plants and at the direction of regulators also made longterm contracts at relatively high rates to ensure a stable supply of electricity from sources that minimized pollution But in a deregulated market the utilities cannot sell power from nuclear plants and their longterm contracts at competitive prices Thus the utilities cost of paying off the debt on their nuclear power plants and other longterm contracts is said to be stranded The nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office said the nuclearrelated stranded costs for the three utilities is about billion Estimates of their total stranded costs are as high as billion Peace and the backers of the deregulation legislation argue that it would be unfair and illegal to force the utilities to pay their stranded costs because the state changed the rules of the game and the marketplace A federal court ruled against a New Hampshire restructuring plan last year that would not have allowed a utility to recover its stranded costs The utilitys lawsuit argued that the plan violated the contracts and takings clauses of the US Constitution The California plan allows the utilities to pay off their stranded costs in two ways The utilities received billion from a bond issue that will be paid off by ratepayers over years and the utilities can add a Competition Transition Charge to ratepayer bills until March Meanwhile rates are capped and the amount of the competition surcharge that could be added to ratepayer bills shrank or disappeared last summer as energy costs soared There is no guarantee that all of the stranded costs will be paid off under the plan Pacific Gas Electric a Northern California utility with hydroelectric power sources is said to have plenty of room under the rate cap and may recover all of its stranded costs But some think that San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison could fall short of full recovery In the view of the backers of Proposition the deregulation legislation is far too generous to utilities The consumer advocates say that the shareholders of the investorowned utilities should share risk as well as profits particularly from the nuclear power plants Harry Snyder of Consumers Union said that other states such as Pennsylvania and Illinois are not asking their ratepayers to pay all of the stranded costs of utilities Proposition would prohibit ratepayers from paying most of the transition costs and all of the bond payments resulting in a rate reduction of at least percent A disputed preliminary staff report from the state Energy Commission estimated that the reduction could be percent The bond deal Most of the controversy has centered on the billion bond issue After the amount was determined by the Public Utilities Commission the bond was issued by private trusts created through the state Infrastructure Bank The bond refinances some longterm utility debt at a lower interest rate Peace said ratepayers save billion on the amount that would be paid on the debt if there had been no refinancing Furthermore said Peace the bonds allowed the deregulation legislation to include a percent rate reduction that took effect last January He said the lower rates not only benefit customers but also thwart unscrupulous competitors I didnt want a bunch of flybynight operators coming in here with all of the ripoffs that we saw during the deregulation of telephones said Peace But the consumer advocates say that the bond payments will offset most of the rate reduction making the alleged shortterm savings from the deregulation little more than a shell game What they did was deny the percent rate reduction said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network or TURN We ended up with a rate reduction of to percent by financing the entire thing and making us pay for years Opponents have been running television ads contending that passage of Proposition could result in the state meaning taxpayers paying off the billion bond rather than the utilities and their shareholders as intended by the authors of the initiative But many think that the courts citing longstanding laws covering contracts would be virtually certain to overturn the provision in Proposition that prohibits ratepayers from paying off the bond Under the existing deregulation the bonds are in essence being financed by ratepayers After talking to experts the Legislative Analysts Office concluded that the probability of taxpayers becoming responsible for the bond is very low The possibility is not even mentioned in the analysts discussion of Proposition in the ballot pamphlet One of the coauthors of the initiative Mike Florio of TURN conceded at a legislative hearing that the provision barring ratepayers from paying off the bond is likely to be overturned in court If ratepayers are charged for the bond payments the initiative has a fallback provision that is intended to require utilities to reduce their rates to offset the bond payments made by ratepayers Consumer groups drop support California and other states began to move toward deregulation after a federal law removed restrictions on the ownership of powergenerating facilities and made it easier for independent power generators to use existing transmission lines Consumer groups and some legislators said that a California Public Utilities Commission decision on deregulation guaranteed full recovery of stranded costs and was skewed toward businesses and big customers at the expense of residential users At first consumer groups welcomed the legislation put together by Peace and others as an improvement over the PUCs plan A fourpage letter from TURN and the San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network expressed some reservations about the plan but concluded with these words However we will not oppose a bill which under difficult circumstances has successfully incorporated a number of the concerns of residential and smallbusiness customers But after more study Proposition was written by a group of consumer advocates including Florio of TURN Snyder of Consumers Union and Harvey Rosenfield whose Proposition cut insurance rates a decade ago Backers of the deregulation legislation accuse the consumer groups of betrayal and breaking a deal while the consumer advocates denounce the legislation as a fraud and a ripoff Peace and Snyder who once had a good working relationship are now exchanging bitter barbs Snyder said of Peace He is doing the bidding of the utilities not the public and he is really a disgrace to democracy Peace said he has never been so disgusted with political opponents It isnt so much the issue as it is their total disrespect for truth and for the process itself The consumer groups used a contribution of about from the Public Media Center a nonprofit organization in San Francisco to gather the voter signatures needed to place the initiative on the ballot Opponents of the initiative have suggested that the Public Media Center laundered contributions from outofstate energy companies and may have exceeded the political contribution limit for nonprofit organizations Herb Chao Gunther Public Media Center president said the organization has received no contributions from outofstate energy companies He said the organization which grossed million during the last two years is well within the contribution limits for nonprofit organizations based on revenue Its the classic defensive posture of trying to make us the issue Gunther said of the allegations from Proposition opponents Proposition What it does Changes a state law deregulating the electric industry Electric utilities would be barred from charging customers to recover the cost of nuclear power plants Customers could not be charged to repay billion worth of bonds issued last year to finance a rate reduction Requires a percent reduction in electricity rates rather than the percent reduction currently required by deregulation Arguments for Privately owned utilities pushed through a deregulation law that allows them to raise electric rates to pay off their moneylosing investments in nuclear power plants The bonds used to cover the cost of a phony percent rate cut would be paid off by private utilities not consumers or taxpayers Consumers would get an honest percent rate cut not covered by backdoor payments to private utilities A study suggests that rates eventually could be cut by a third Supporters Consumers Union Ralph Nader Harvey Rosenfield The Utility Reform Network and League of Women Voters Arguments against Taxpayers would be liable for the billion bond repayment potentially causing a major cut in funding for schools and other services or a tax increase Changing the source of repayment for the billion bond would jeopardize state and local bond ratings The plug would be pulled on a deregulation plan that eventually will produce permanent electricity rate reductions through a competitive market system The poorly written measure

Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS Only a few unplug Despite deregulation of consumers stay with same power firms Craig D Rose STAFF WRITER The San Diego UnionTribune C Copyright State Sen Steve Peace can take credit for coauthoring Californias electricity deregulation bill legislation that appeared to revolutionize the power market and provide an array of choices to consumers But when it comes to his own home Peace hasnt revolutionized anything His household is still drawing current from SDGE Here is where my wifes skepticism is said the Democrat from El Cajon And she makes the decisions The Peace family belongs to a very big club About percent of the states consumers continue to receive electricity from their local utility despite the nominally competitive market now in place In fact a full six months after deregulation of the states billion power industry the outcome remains short of electrifying In August about of the million utility customers switched to a new power provider But during the same period switched back to their local utility Overall about percent of the load in competitive markets has switched to new providers with utility companies retaining the percent of the market theyve traditionally held If consumers are underwhelmed wouldbe competitors also express surprise at the lack of competition in the newly opened market Of the that signed up to be new power providers only five or six are legitimate power providers said Frederick Bloom chief executive officer of Commonwealth Energy which claims customers Under Californias deregulation plan SDGE and other local utilities have retained their monopolies over regional power grids But there is supposed to be competition in the powergeneration business Companies registered with the California Public Utilities Commission win the right to sign up customers and supply power to a state pool in amounts equivalent to the usage of their customers And hundreds of companies signed up to compete But the new power companies say that technical hassles and the burden of paying utilities about billion for their unprofitable nuclear plants and other investments socalled stranded costs shouldered by all ratepayers is limiting their ability to truly compete Many find theyre unable to offer much if anything beyond the percent rate reduction mandated to all ratepayers under the states deregulation law The payback of stranded costs meanwhile has provoked Proposition a voter initiative that would rewrite terms of the open power market and cancel the payoff to utilities while promising deeper rate cuts to small power users If smaller users have found little to excite them in the new market some larger commercial power users have found savings in the deregulated market Collectively these larger users have switched about percent of their load to new providers A small number of residential consumers also are unplugging from local utilities for green power electricity said to be generated by means other than burning a fossil fuel Peace says all this is what he expected This is probably the single most complex transition of any single market Peace said Im stunned by how smoothly it has gone But Harvey Rosenfield a consumer activist leading the effort to pass Proposition says consumer indifference proves that Californias deregulation is a total fraud Its a devastating indictment of the way deregulation was crafted by the Legislature to destroy competition for residential ratepayers Rosenfield said Either way deregulation has opened the door to small savings for at least a few local power users The San Diego Association of Governments which purchased about million in power annually from SDGE hopes to cut about million from its yearly power bill by purchasing its energy from Commonwealth Energy Corp in Tustin The savings were hard to find The association had to twice bid out its power needs before finding a vendor that could provide savings worth the effort to switch Even with a vendor in hand the changeover has been prickly Its a very detailed process for switching each account said Steven Sachs senior planner with SANDAG What had been expected to be a day process is now nearing completion after more than three months he said We hope the headache was mostly at the front end Sachs said The real issue is that all local governments have to be in the energy market so its a great chance for these people to learn about what is going on Macys department stores in San Diego have also unplugged from SDGE and contracted for power from New Energy Ventures The department store chain made the switch to save money said Russ Brown energy manager for Macys Western division but he declined to discuss the amount of savings the stores hope to achieve Nobody does this to lose money Brown said New Energy Ventures which is supplying power to Macys meanwhile touts itself as the biggest winner in the new market The Los Angelesbased company says its won about percent of the power load now being supplied by companies other than the major utilities The company says the key to its success has been sharedsavings contracts with customers in which the power company and its customers share the savings that are achieved through the relationship said Michael Peevey the companys chief executive officer Smaller users Peevey noted that such savings are unavailable to residential and small commercial customers The automatic percent rate cut plus the stranded cost payments make it difficult for new companies to compete against the utilities for smaller power users We look forward to the time in when the utilities industrys stranded costs are paid by customers so that we can begin to provide truly significant reductions in energy costs for customers said Peevey Arthur ODonnell editor of California Energy Markets a weekly newsletter based in San Francisco agreed that the rate cut and the burden of stranded costs has eliminated the potential for lower prices for most Californians Attempting to compete on price under the current market structure can be fatal ODonnell added who noted that at least three companies competing for residential customers have already defaulted unable to deliver the power they promised consumers and forced to turn their accounts back to utilities Thats the first solid evidence of people getting washed out of the market said ODonnell Peace says small customers will have more significant choices in power company offerings within a few years It was always our preference in the Legislature that the transition to competition in the residential arena not be pushed fast because residential customers are vulnerable to scams said Peace Moving slowly will allow residential power users to become more sophisticated about their choice In the meantime he said small customers have benefited from the percent rate cut plus from the boost to the state economy from the savings that larger companies are achieving in their power bills Green power niche That said green power has found a niche in the new market although these offerings require customers to pay up to percent above the cost of conventional power ODonnell calls green power the most robust sector of the new market Among the leaders in the niche is Green Mountain Energy Resources of Vermont The company declines to disclose the number of customers it has signed up beyond saying its greater than and should exceed by yearend Douglas Hyde president of Green Mountain believes that more than percent of Californias millions power users are potential green power customers The lack of active price competition is not what we expected but on the other hand were convinced the value of the green power we bring to the market will excite people said Hyde We sell cleaner resources to customers who care about the market That customer base may extend beyond what many expected Edison Source for example a unit of Edison International has won a contract to supply power from renewable sources to several of Toyota Motor Sales USAs offices in California Other commercial users have also gone green said ODonnell But any revolution in the California market is unlikely for several years he said What has happened is kind of what was expected ODonnell said Deregulation was not meant for residential customers Trickle but no bolt A few thousand of SDGEs million

Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year contract Earlier in February CPN had reached agreement with the DWR on a separate year contract for an additional mws EIX WMB MLPFS was a manager of the most recent public offering of securities of
