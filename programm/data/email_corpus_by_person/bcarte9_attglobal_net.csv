Date Friday October GMT Subject Here is some useful information on Anthrax that was sent to Conoco employees by Conocos Corporate Security Please post or forward as needed ANTHRAX INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYEES Corporate Security is aware of the media reports of Anthrax mailings and everyones heightened concern of a possible contamination at Conoco We have maintained contact with the FBI Hazmat officials and other government agencies regarding the investigations about and the risk of contracting Anthrax as a result of receiving a letter With the heightened concern we all need to become better educated about Anthrax and deal with it on a rational level rather than an emotional one We have evaluated the available information and intelligence and believe the risk of an Anthrax exposure at Conoco is low at the present time Most reported instances of letters containing alleged Anthrax and powdery substances have proven to be hoaxes At this time all of the confirmed cases except one have been directed at the news media and U S Government officials Procedures are being furnished Conoco mailrooms regarding screening of mail and packages prior to distributions However so everyone is educated regarding Anthrax and handling pieces of mail we are furnishing the below information FACTS ABOUT ANTHRAX Anthrax is a small invisible organism that cannot be seen by the naked eye To effectively target an individual in a letter the Anthrax must be mixed with a powdery medium and placed in the letter It then becomes a visible substance resembling a brownish or white powder and will immediately settle to the ground The Anthrax must be effectively dispersed and the victim must be exposed to a relatively large amount of Anthrax to become infected Fortunately Anthrax can be washed off with soap and water after handling Anthrax is not contagious there is no threat of persontoperson transmittal If someone is exposed to Anthrax it is treatable with antibiotics Over of Anthrax cases occur when spores linger on the skin in cuts or scratches Anthrax cannot penetrate intact skin Exposure causes lesions that initially resemble an insect bite which progresses into a fluidfilled blister within a day or two with swelling at the site of the infection The blister forms a black scab Twenty percent of the time individuals who develop skin lesions may progress onto developing wide spread disease which requires immediate treatment The second method of obtaining Anthrax poisoning is through ingestion Gastrointestinal Anthrax is extremely rare in humans and is usually contracted when undercooked infected meat is eaten The initial signs of gastrointestinal Anthrax are nausea loss of appetite vomiting and fever This may be followed by abdominal pain vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea The third method is inhalation of Anthrax spores The onset of inhalation of Anthrax is gradual after a short incubation period which is usually within seven days in rare cases it is sometimes longer The victim may initially experience flu like symptoms that start to improve This mild illness can then progress rapidly to respiratory distress and shock in two to four days followed by more severe symptoms that include breathing difficulty and exhaustion If you have had a Known exposure you should seek medical care for monitoring and potentially for treatment if indicated If you have had a possible exposure and are having symptoms you should seek medical evaluation and treatment through your personal physician If you do not have a personal physician IHS can help direct you to appropriate care It is difficult to contract inhalation Anthrax by the mere act of opening an envelope or package containing a suspected agent or walking through settled material This would generally not provide the energy required to aerosolize the agent The FBI has advised that hundreds of letters have been referred to them because they were suspected of containing Anthrax So far of all the letters referred to the FBI very few have contained Anthrax Most letters implying they contain Anthrax will also contain a written or implied threat As of this date there is no evidence that any such letters have ever been directed at anyone at Conoco HOW TO HANDLE SUSPECTED ANTHRAX AND OTHER SUSPECTED BIOLOGICAL AGENT THREATS Many facilities in communities around the country have received Anthrax threat letters Most were empty envelopes some have contained powdery substances most have proved negative for Anthrax The purpose of these guidelines is to recommend procedures for handling letters suspected of containing Anthrax DO NOT PANIC To infect the organism must be rubbed into abraded skin swallowed or inhaled as a fine aerosolized mist Disease can be prevented after exposure to the Anthrax spores by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics Anthrax is not spread from one person to another person For Anthrax to be effective as a covert agent it must be aerosolized into very small particles This is difficult to do and requires a great deal of technical skill and special equipment If these small particles are inhaled lifethreatening lung infection can occur but prompt recognition and treatment are effective SUSPICIOUS UNOPENED LETTER OR PACKAGE MARKED WITH THREATENING MESSAGE SUCH AS ANTHRAX Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package PLACE the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents If you do not have any container then COVER the envelope or package with anything eg clothing paper trash can etc and do not remove this cover Then LEAVE the room and CLOSE the door or section off the area to prevent others from entering ie keep others away WASH your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face What to do next If you are at HOME then report the incident to local police If you are at WORK then report the incident to security or an available supervisor LIST all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized Give a copy of this list to security the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for followup investigations and advice ENVELOPE WITH POWDER AND POWDER SPILLS OUT ONTO SURFACE DO NOT try to CLEAN UP the powder COVER the spilled contents immediately with anything eg clothing paper trash can etc and do not remove this cover Then LEAVE the room and CLOSE the door or section off the area to prevent others from entering ie keep others away WASH your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face What to do next If you are at HOME then report the incident to local police If you are at WORK then report the incident to security or an available supervisor REMOVE heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag or some other container that can be sealed This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling SHOWER with soap and water as soon as possible Do Not Use Bleach Or Other Disinfectant On Your Skin If possible list all people who were in the room or area especially those who had actual contact with the powder Give a copy of this list to security the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical followup and to law enforcement officials for further investigation If prescribed medication by medical personnel take it until otherwise instructed or it runs out HOW TO IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND LETTERS The U S Postal Inspection Service has provided information about letters and packages that ought to trigger suspicion This include parcels that Are unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you Excessive postage Using postage stamps not meter strips Sloppy or unprofessional preparation Incorrect titles Titles but no names Sloshing sounds possibly liquid contents Excessive wrapping materials such as masking tape strapping tape or string Are addressed to someone no longer with your organization or are otherwise outdated Have no return address or have one that cant be verified as legitimate Are of unusual weight given their size or are lopsided or oddly shaped Are marked with restrictive endorsements such as Personal or Confidential Show a city or state in the postmark that doesnt match the return address Have protruding wires strange odors or stains Handwritten or poorly typed addresses Misspellings of common words Oily stains discolorations or odor None of these indicators standing alone can identify a suspect package that contains Anthrax All known relevant facts must be taken into consideration to properly evaluate the situation We have been advised that the FBI has made the following response recommendations to Local Law Enforcement Unopened letterspackages with no suspicious markings or indicators No law enforcementemergency response action is recommended Recipients of the letterpackage may be advised that if they are concerned about opening a piece of mail they should not do so Opened letterspackages with material that has spilled out Law enforcement should follow local response protocols for potential hazardous materials The local FBI office should be notified and can coordinate a threat assessment and technical assistanceadvice as needed Unopened sealed letterspackages with suspicious markings or indicators Law enforcement should follow local protocols for responding to the location and collecting the suspect mail As additional information comes available it will be communicated
